Here\u2019s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The US military is not the primary force anymore in Asia, and it would struggle to defend its allies against the Chinese. This sobering assessment comes from a new report that claims missiles from China\u2019s rapidly improving military could overwhelm US bases in the region in a matter of hours. So, Japan, Australia and other US partners need to bolster their forces in the region, said the report from\u00a0the United States Study Center\u00a0at Australia\u2019s University of Sydney. A spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry said the country\u2019s military policy is \u201cdefensive in nature.\u201d The Pentagon has not yet responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Did Google manipulate millions of votes in the 2016 election?\u00a0No, but President Trump falsely claimed the tech giant did. In a tweet, Trump said Google \u201cmanipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton\u201d in the election. The President probably was referring to a Fox Business segment about psychologist Robert Epstein, who alleged in congressional testimony this summer that he found pro-Clinton bias in Google\u2019s search results. But there\u2019s no evidence that Google \u201cmanipulated\u201d the results to favor Clinton. Google (and others)\u00a0said Epstein\u2019s bias claim is wrong. Planned Parenthood will drop federal funding because it doesn\u2019t want to comply with a Trump administration rule barring it from talking to patients about abortion services. The organization\u2019s acting president said the rule is \u201cunethical and dangerous\u201d and that Planned Parenthood will continue to fight it in court. Critics argue the rule \u2013 which prohibits taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion with patients or referring patients to abortion providers \u2013 will affect low-income people, communities of color and uninsured and rural residents the most. The officer found guilty in a disciplinary trial of putting Eric Garner in a choke hold moments before he died five years ago has been fired. Daniel Pantaleo will also not receive his pension. Garner died in 2014 as police tried to arrest him for illegally selling cigarettes. In video of the arrest, Pantaleo is seen putting Garner in a department-banned chokehold. Garner can be heard saying, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Garner\u2019s death, weeks before the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, fueled a push for police accountability and brought the Black Lives Matter movement to the forefront. More than 9,000 people have been evacuated\u00a0as a wildfire rages in the Canary Islands. The blaze, which started over the weekend, has already torched almost 25,000 acres on the Spanish islands, located off the northwest coast of Africa. It\u2019s the second major wildfire there this month, after a blaze at the beginning of August forced the evacuation of 1,000 people. The Canary Islands are a popular vacation destination.

Outrage over President Trump\u2019s racist tweets about four Democratic congresswomen has reached a fever pitch. In a dramatic session last night that involved gavel-throwing by a frustrated Democratic representative and harsh words from Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the House voted to officially condemn Trump\u2019s language. Four Republicans and one independent voted for the official denunciation. Trump defended his tweets in even more tweets yesterday, saying his words \u201cwere NOT Racist\u201d and urging Republicans to vote against the resolution. Meanwhile, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway drew ire yesterday when she asked the ethnicity of a reporter questioning the intention of Trump\u2019s Twitter language. Ex-Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa confirmed suspicions raised by CNN reporting: Julian Assange was interfering in the 2016 US presidential election while living under political asylum in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London. Despite aligning himself for years with Assange on anti-US sentiment, Correa downplayed his ties to the Wikileaks founder. Correa said he\u2019d never spoken with Assange in person and that claims Assange practically ran the embassy during his time there are \u201cnonsense.\u201d Critics say the Ecuadorian government\u2019s support of Assange allowed Wikileaks to leak information about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 race. Correa denied that his government worked with Assange to help Trump win and said he preferred Clinton, calling Trump \u201can enemy of our migrants.\u201d Planned Parenthood\u2019s president has been ousted after less than a year on the job. Dr. Leana Wen hinted in a Facebook statement that she was pushed out because of differing opinions on how to present the issue of abortion to the public.\u00a0Wen said in a statement that she thinks access to abortion \u201cis not a political issue but a health care one.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that it\u2019s a dire time for reproductive rights advocates. Republican leaders across the country are moving to tighten access to abortion services, and\u00a0the Department of Health and Human Services just announced that\u00a0new rules prohibiting taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion with patients are now in effect. Planned Parenthood has called the new regulations \u201cdevastating, illegal, & unethical\u201d and says it will not abide by them. The State Department has sanctioned four top Myanmar military officials for human rights abuses. The move was in response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis involving the country\u2019s Rohingya population. If you\u2019ll recall, the Rohingya are a stateless Muslim ethnic group that have been subject to extreme discrimination and violence. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctioned officials were responsible \u201cfor gross human rights violations,\u201d including extrajudicial killings, during the campaign of violence against the Rohingya that began in 2017. Several international groups have condemned Myanmar\u2019s military leaders for their role in the ongoing crisis. The United Nations has called for Myanmar\u2019s military leaders to be prosecuted for war crimes and genocide. Abigail Disney visited Disneyland undercover, and she says she\u2019s \u201clivid\u201d at what she saw. The family heiress, filmmaker and activist says she was prompted to take a secret trip after a park employee messaged her on Facebook, and she was shocked at the working conditions that low-paid park workers described. After her trip, the heiress called on Disney CEO Bob Iger to address the pay inequity between him and the average Disney worker. \u201cBob needs to understand that he is an employee just the same as the people scrubbing gum off the sidewalk are employees, and they\u2019re entitled to the same dignity and human rights that he is,\u201d she said. Disney has regularly criticized Iger\u2019s pay package ($66 million last year), and she addressed Congress in May about capitalism and human rights. \u201cHe brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom, and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation.\u201d Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, remarking on retired Justice John Paul Stevens, who passed away yesterday at the age of 99 \u201cFacebook is dangerous.\u00a0Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience.\u201d US Sen.\u00a0Sherrod Brown,\u00a0a Democrat and ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, during a Senate hearing regarding\u00a0Facebook\u2019s proposal for a new digital currency, called Libra What you Googled this year Chicagoans, you may now return to your regularly scheduled summer.

At long last, we have heard from the man behind the Mueller report.\u00a0Special counsel Robert Mueller made a rare public appearance yesterday to issue a statement on the findings of his report and to announce the closing of the special counsel\u2019s office. In his remarks, Mueller made it clear he did not pursue obstruction of justice charges against President Trump based on his findings because Justice Department guidelines don\u2019t allow him that option.\u00a0\u201cIf we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cWe did not, however, make a determination as to whether the President did commit a crime.\u201d Mueller\u2019s statement undercuts the narrative of\u00a0Attorney General William Barr, who has been accused of mischaracterizing the report and the Mueller team\u2019s reasons for not bringing charges against the President. It also reinvigorated talk among Democrats about possible impeachment procedures.\u00a0Prominent Democrats, including several 2020 contenders, called for an impeachment inquiry after Mueller\u2019s comments, but so far\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler have resisted the call. It\u2019s back to the drawing board for the Israeli national elections. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasn\u2019t been able\u00a0to put together a coalition government from the parties elected in April to parliament, so now the country will hold another round of national elections in late summer.\u00a0It\u2019s the first time in Israel\u2019s history that a general election has failed to produce a government. April\u2019s elections appeared to be a huge victory for Netanyahu, but negotiations between opposing parties in Israel\u2019s parliament, called the Knesset, led to a deadlock among party leaders and all sorts of political problems for the country\u2019s longtime head of state. Now, Israeli citizens will head back to the polls in September in hopes of establishing a working political majority. President Trump tried to do a bit of damage control after reports that the White House Military Office and lower-level US Navy officials exchanged emails about moving\u00a0the USS John McCain, a Navy war ship, ahead of Trump\u2019s recent Japan visit. The vessel \u2013 first named for the late senator\u2019s father and grandfather \u2013 sits in the harbor on the US Navy base in Yokosuka, Japan, where Trump spoke to troops during a Memorial Day event. Obviously, Trump and the late senator didn\u2019t get along, and Trump has repeatedly criticized McCain, even after his death. Once military leaders got wind of the discussion about moving the ship, \u201cthey said knock it off,\u201d a senior Navy official told CNN, and it stayed in place.\u00a0Trump tweeted that he was \u201cnot informed\u201d of anything having to do with the war ship before he got to Japan. Eight people are dead and more than a dozen others missing\u00a0after a sightseeing boat collided with another vessel on the Danube River in the Hungarian capital of Budapest. Thirty-five\u00a0people, including 33 South Korean tourists,\u00a0were on board last night when the vessel crashed and capsized. There\u2019s no word yet on why the boat sank after being hit, but the tour company says it\u2019s hosted\u00a0thousands of trips like this one, with the boat operating\u00a0safely on the river since 2003. South Korea\u2019s\u00a0President and foreign minister are helping coordinate rescue efforts and communication channels for the families of those involved. The French Senate has decided Notre Dame must be restored to exactly the way it was before that devastating April fire destroyed parts of the beloved landmark. There had been debate about whether to take the opportunity to give the cathedral a modern makeover. But the Senate ruled that Notre Dame must be restored to its \u201clast known visual state,\u201d which includes the 300-foot-tall spire that crumbled during the blaze. The plan is to have the work done in about five years, in time for Paris to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. But that\u2019s a point of contention, too: Some say, in order to be done properly, the reconstruction should take two or three times that long.

            "article_content": "The Labour Party\u2019s wipeout in Britain\u2019s election spelled out an undeniable warning to Democrats over the potential dangers of tracking too far to the left of more moderate national electorates. But it also highlighted a more profound parallel in the often synergistic US and UK politics that potentially poses longer-term threats to progressive parties: culturally and politically, they have lost touch with their heartland working-class voters \u2013 the very people they were set up to represent. The most significant warning for Democrats from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s disaster may be that when a party gets consumed by its own ideological debate, it risks losing sight of subtle changes in its own base. Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson picked up a haul of seats across Labour strongholds and won the support of the opposition party\u2019s traditional base \u2013  blue collar, unionized industrial workers. As the results were rolling in on Thursday night, it looked a lot like US election night in 2016 as a Trump wave swept across the former Democratic rust belt power base in the Midwest. In the UK, as in the US, such constituencies had suffered economic blight for decades \u2013 ironically, many from liberalizing economic reforms introduced by the Conservatives in the 1980s. As a result, they have harbored fierce resentment against upper class Tories from down south \u2013 like Johnson. But the Prime Minister, helped by his simple demands to honor the referendum to get the UK out of the European Union \u2013 a goal many working class voters support and on which Labour has a muddled policy \u2013 engineered a generational political shift. Labour hotbeds have also been changing, a factor that seems to have escaped its ideologically radical left wing leaders in London. Some of those former industrialized areas have also started to regenerate. New industries are beginning to spring up in the place of mining and steel manufacturing that were driven out by globalization. That has changed the demographics of some seats in Labour\u2019s red wall, and memories are fading of the great industrial strikes and battles against the Conservative governments of the 1980s. Once, Labour was untouchable in the mill towns and mining villages of northern England and the shipyards of Scotland, piling up power through once-huge labor unions. But it is seen increasingly as a socially liberal, metropolitan party that has moved on culturally from many of its more conservative working-class voters in the UK\u2019s rust belt. The power of unions is not what it was, and the urban liberal versus rural conservative divide is as important in UK politics as it is in America. The Democratic Party has seemed to undergo a similar shift \u2013 a factor seized upon by conservatives when Hillary Clinton blasted Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201cdeplorables\u201d in 2016. This has occurred as Trump has refashioned the GOP\u2019s country club image and worked to corral working-class voters disillusioned with conventional politics and economic policies that they believe left them behind. It\u2019s ironic that it took a billionaire from Manhattan with his name splashed across his private jet and an Eton-educated toff to find a new political language to attract working class voters. The themes of the political post-mortem among progressives in Britain after Johnson\u2019s rout will be familiar to anyone following the Democratic presidential race. Moderate candidates like Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden are accusing their more radical rivals like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders of adopting a perilous Corbyn playbook. The former vice president leaped on the comparison at a fundraiser on Thursday night as the UK results rolled in. \u201cBoris Johnson is winning in a walk,\u201d Biden said, predicting headlines reading, \u201cLook what happens when the Labour Party moves so, so far to the left. It comes up with ideas that are not able to be contained within a rational basis quickly.\u201d Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire centrist who launched a presidential campaign because he believes the Democrats are too extreme and can\u2019t beat Trump, also jumped on the UK bandwagon. \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s catastrophic showing in the U.K. is a clear warning: We need a Democratic nominee who can defeat Donald Trump by running a campaign that appeals to Americans across our divides,\u201d Bloomberg wrote on Twitter Friday. The Democratic primary has seen pitched debates over issues like expanding the federal government\u2019s role in health care and free college, and squabbles about how ideologically pure the party should be. A similar debate has been going on for years since Corbyn took over the Labour Party. He reversed former multiple-election-winning Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s modernization project. Boris Johnson won the election but he may struggle to keep the UK together There are often similarities between US and UK politics. After all, these are two great Western democracies that are prone to similar economic, cultural and demographic forces and issues. Former President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher forged a linked conservative renaissance in both nations in the 1980s. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair bonded over Third Way centrism a decade later. And on Thursday, Britons chose to stick with a blond-haired, thin-on-details, populist-style leader with a complicated relationship with the truth and open contempt for the press. Trump certainly took inspiration for his own fortunes after Johnson secured the biggest Conservative majority since Thatcher\u2019s second reelection race in 1987. \u201cIt might be a harbinger of what\u2019s to come in our country. It was last time,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. Britain\u2019s surprising referendum vote to leave the European Union in 2016 foreshadowed Trump\u2019s victory later that year and was based on some similar populist, anti-establishment trends \u2013 though Trump\u2019s repeated claims that he predicted the result are a flight of fancy. Still, Conservatives\u2019 win \u2013 and the Democratic presidential race and omens for Trump\u2019s reelection \u2013 are not a perfect comparison for the primary race of the 2020 US election. Corbyn was a historically radical figure. He would have been the most left-wing Prime Minister in British history. His platform of huge public spending and nationalizing utilities and the railways is far more ambitious than any Sanders is planning, for instance. That\u2019s notwithstanding the Vermont senator\u2019s vow to forge a \u201crevolution\u201d and plans for single-payer health care. Trump\u2019s complaints that Sanders is a radical socialist might be more accurate if addressed to Corbyn. And Corbyn\u2019s problems were not just political. His personality and history of association with radical and extremist global political groups like the IRA and Hamas left many traditional Labour voters uneasy. Critics saw him, at best, in denial about a row over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. And party activists reported that Corbyn was a problem constantly raised by voters during canvassing. It\u2019s unlikely that whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee will advocate values quite so antithetical to millions of voters. Britain\u2019s vote was also overlaid by complications over Brexit that make it difficult to draw direct lines with the US. Corbyn had a muddled position on the issue that did not appeal to core Labour voters who wanted out. Johnson campaigned on a simple phrase \u2013 \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d \u2013 that recalled the clarity of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d mantra. His challenge in the next few years will be to lock in voters who supported him over Brexit who have a generational suspicion of the Conservative Party and might return to Labour if it returns to a more moderate path. Trump is seeking to do exactly the same thing in his reelection race in 2020 in midwestern swing states. And the President has been careful not to replicate one of the Labour Party\u2019s mistakes: His entire presidency \u2013 with its riotous rallies and careful appeals to the base on issues like abortion and gun control \u2013 sometimes seems like an attempt to stress his cultural affinity with the people who put him in power. The Point: Should Boris Johnson's landslide win make 2020 Democrats nervous? But while Trump frequently praises Johnson and both are seen as populists of the same mold, the comparisons can be overdrawn. Johnson and Trump do share deep suspicion of the European Union. And their populism and the revolt against the establishment does seem motivated by political expediency. Trump, in his years as a flamboyant real estate magnate and tabloid target, was often snubbed by Manhattan\u2019s social and political elites. But Johnson is hardly an outsider. He was educated at the elite Eton private school and comes from a social class that still regards itself as born to rule. While Trump seems dedicated to tearing down the social and political order, Johnson, whose hero is Winston Churchill, is simply clambering back to his ordained place in its upper echelons. And the British Prime Minister is \u2013 Brexit apart \u2013 an utterly conventional figure. He\u2019s less radical than Thatcher in his conservatism. And from his belief in climate change to his position on the Iran nuclear deal, he\u2019s far closer to European leaders than Trump. He\u2019s vowing to pour billions of British pounds into the country\u2019s state-run national health service \u2013 a position that puts him closer to Sanders and Warren than to Trump. In fact, Johnson sits comfortably in an ideological spectrum that encompasses leaders like Blair, Clinton, Barack Obama and former Prime Minister David Cameron. He\u2019s far from the disruptive, tear-down-the-establishment instincts of Trump. And Britain\u2019s Labour Party is generally to the left of the Democrats \u2013 its radical wings are far closer to authentic socialism than Sanders\u2019 proposals. And the balance of power of the Conservative Party, which, while radicalized over Europe, is to the left of the GOP\u2019s ideology on social issues. So while there are clear comparisons and lessons to be drawn from the UK election result as the US looks towards 2020, the most important one might be this: every country and every election is unique.",

            "article_content": "On the Sunday before Thanksgiving the Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, made a secret trip to the White House to introduce his pick for the next senator from Georgia to President Donald Trump. A Trump-aligned conservative wrapping up his first year in office, Kemp had brought along Kelly Loeffler, an Atlanta businesswoman and political novice whom he wanted to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, who will retire at the end of the year. Former White House aide Nick Ayers, an important player in Georgia Republican politics, came along to sell Trump on Loeffler. But the charm offensive didn\u2019t work. An official familiar with the meeting told CNN the President was frustrated and advised Kemp against tapping Loeffler. He told Kemp he wanted him to select Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee and a vocal critic of the impeachment effort. The scene was unusual \u2013 governors, even Republicans in the age of Trump, rarely make overt appeals to the President about Senate appointments. Stranger still, Kemp looked prepared to buck the President, discarding the boost-the-base political strategy they both embraced in 2018 and 2016 for an appeal to the more moderate, suburban voters Republicans have lost. Kemp announced at a press conference in Atlanta on Wednesday morning that Loeffler will succeed Isakson. He introduced Loeffler as a \u201cconservative businesswoman and political outsider.\u201d Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who\u2019s the Senate majority leader, told reporters Tuesday that he would be \u201cbehind\u201d Loeffler and said she would be \u201cterrific\u201d \u2013 a sure sign the Washington GOP establishment is welcoming her selection. She\u2019ll also have the support of the powerful National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund, the McConnell-allied super PAC, in next year\u2019s election. Republicans in Georgia say whoever Kemp picks to fill Isakson\u2019s seat has important implications for the future of the GOP. Selecting Loeffler suggests Georgia Republicans are starting to look beyond Trump\u2019s coalition for the long-term health of their party. Under Georgia law, whoever replaces Isakson will have to run in November 2020 to serve out the last two years of his term. They could have a lot of competition. Georgia will hold a jungle primary for the Isakson seat, meaning multiple candidates from both parties can challenge Kemp\u2019s appointee. Whoever emerges as the winner next year will have to run again two years later, in 2022. They\u2019ll have to be popular enough to fend off any Republican challengers who might split the GOP vote, and also help the party weather shifting political coalitions and the state\u2019s changing demographics, which Republicans worry could threaten their statewide dominance. That\u2019s a lot to place on a first-time politician like Loeffler. Several Republican operatives in Georgia say Loeffler could be a smart selection as the state GOP grapples with how to attract moderate suburban voters. A \u201cwhite male conservative doesn\u2019t bring anything to the ticket,\u201d one operative told CNN. If Loeffler is appointed and wins election in 2020, she\u2019ll be the first woman elected to the Senate in state history. A 49-year-old executive at a commodities trading firm in Atlanta, Loeffler is a prominent Republican donor who considered running for the Senate in 2014. Despite co-owning the WNBA\u2019s Atlanta Dream and being familiar to the Atlanta business community, Loeffler has little statewide name recognition. But she is an attractive candidate for other reasons, including her ability to self-fund her campaign. With Republicans looking at Trump and Sen. David Perdue (who is up for reelection) at the top of their ticket in Georgia next fall, some say Loeffler inserts some much-needed diversity. \u201cOn paper, she fits the bill of what you\u2019re looking for \u2013 somebody who can bring the suburban women vote in, and who\u2019s got a good story to tell,\u201d said the GOP operative. Another Republican strategist familiar with Georgia said Loeffler \u201ccouldn\u2019t have a better r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to appeal to the suburban Atlanta voter.\u201d But with no political track record or proven campaign skills, Loeffler presents a risk for Republicans, too. \u201cTime will tell how she performs on the stump,\u201d said the strategist. Appealing to suburban voters has been a big part of the GOP\u2019s rise in the Peach State. Georgia was the last Southern state to elect its first Republican governor when Sonny Perdue won in 2002, and the party\u2019s strength in Atlanta\u2019s growing suburbs delivered GOP majorities in the state Legislature and congressional delegation. But that strength has waned recently as Democrats have become more competitive in Georgia\u2019s suburbs. That strength was on display in last year\u2019s governor\u2019s race, when Democrat Stacey Abrams came within 2 percentage points of beating Kemp. Abrams won the Atlanta suburban counties of Cobb and Gwinnett, which were once considered Republican strongholds. In much the same way in 2016, Trump lost Cobb and Gwinnett after Mitt Romney had easily won them in 2012. \u201cRepublicans in Georgia lost suburban voters who identify as Republican but don\u2019t like Trump,\u201d said Erick Erickson, the Atlanta-based talk-radio host and conservative activist. \u201cKemp himself saw a loss of support from those voters because he was perceived as being Trump\u2019s candidate.\u201d In picking Loeffler, Kemp not rejected only Trump\u2019s personal advice but also the White House\u2019s broader political strategy to maximize Republican base voters in 2020. Some Georgia Republicans say it could redound to Kemp\u2019s benefit. The GOP operative told CNN that Kemp will have the ability to say to swing voters in 2022 that he was not a puppet of Trump. That only works, however, if Republican voters in Georgia get on board with Loeffler and she wins the election outright next fall. Some conservative interest groups and media outlets have raised concerns that Loeffler does not pass certain ideological litmus tests, particularly on abortion. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who\u2019s a close ally of Trump\u2019s, has called on Kemp to appoint Collins and blasted the governor\u2019s expected plans to defy Trump. Kemp responded to these charges, without revealing his selection, by tweeting last week: \u201cThe idea that I would appoint someone to the U.S. Senate that is NOT pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment, pro-freedom, and 100% supportive of our President (and his plan to Keep America Great) is ridiculous.\u201d Whether a Trump ally like Collins \u2013 who has not ruled out running for the seat in 2020 \u2013 would actually jump in could depend a lot on the President\u2019s acceptance of Loeffler. To that point, Loeffler has one key asset in her favor: money. Last month, she donated $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising operation to help reelect the President. \u201cIf that\u2019s a rehearsal, wait until you see the dance,\u201d said the Republican operative. This story has been updated to reflect that Kemp appointed Loffler on Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, Kristen Holmes and Nick Valencia contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Sometime later this week, Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is expected to name businesswoman Kelly Loeffler to the Senate vacancy caused by the planned resignation of Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson on December 31. Which, no big whoop, right? A Republican governor picks a Republican to fill a Republican-held seat. But this is the Trump era! And everything has the potential for controversy! See: President Donald Trump wants Kemp to name GOP Rep. Doug Collins, an ardent defender of the President, to the Senate seat. Kemp has resisted. It\u2019s gotten heated. To explain how we got here \u2013 and whether Kemp might change his mind \u2013 I reached out to Greg Bluestein, a must-follow political reporter at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Cillizza: Why does Donald Trump want Doug Collins to be in the Senate so badly? Bluestein: First off, he\u2019s one of the President\u2019s chief defenders in Congress, becoming a household name among Trump supporters for his criticism of impeachment proceedings. That role will only grow this week, as impeachment hearings shift to the House Judiciary Committee, where Collins is the ranking Republican. A lawyer and US Air Force chaplain, Collins has also grown personally close with the President over the years and \u2013 almost as importantly \u2013 his inner circle of advisers. Donald Trump Jr. was here a few weeks ago to raise campaign cash for Collins, and Jared Kushner has aggressively pushed for him. Another reason Trump and his allies want Collins in the seat: He\u2019s a known quantity. He represents one of the most conservative House districts on the Eastern Seaboard and is a fixture on Fox News. Trump & Co. know where he stands on every important issue of the day, and they see him as a bulldog who can stand toe-to-toe with whoever the Democrats put up. Plus, Trump\u2019s camp probably feels like Kemp owes the President. Kemp may have won last year\u2019s Republican runoff against a better-financed opponent without Trump\u2019s support, but the surprise endorsement six days before the vote fueled his runaway victory. The governor\u2019s critics are all too ready to remind him of that. Cillizza: Why does Brian Kemp want Kelly Loeffler in the Senate so badly? Bluestein: The governor wants to put his own stamp on what\u2019s possibly the biggest political decision he\u2019s ever made. And his decision can\u2019t be framed without taking into account his narrow victory last year against Democrat Stacey Abrams in the closest gubernatorial election in Georgia in decades. Abrams came within a whisker of forcing a runoff against Kemp by blazing a blue streak across the north Atlanta suburbs where Republicans once dominated. She did this by winning over college-educated women in the \u2018burbs, along with energizing African-American voters and liberals in the party\u2019s base. With Loeffler, who would be the second female US senator in Georgia history, Kemp is trying to expand the Georgia GOP\u2019s appeal to those moderate and independent voters who have fled the Republican fold. He\u2019ll probably cast it as the latest of history-making appointments that have surprised even his critics. But more than 2020 is at stake here. Kemp\u2019s pick will not only be on next year\u2019s ballot to fill out the remaining two years of Johnny Isakson\u2019s term, but also potentially on the ticket with him in 2022 \u2013 when the governor stands for reelection and could face Abrams in a rematch. That means Kemp essentially gets to pick his own running mate. He\u2019s betting that a multi-millionaire executive and co-owner of Atlanta\u2019s WNBA franchise who can self-finance her own campaign and can broaden the party\u2019s tent even while keeping conservatives at peace. (Though not much is known about Loeffler\u2019s stances, Kemp has indicated her ideological priorities align with his.) But it\u2019s a big gamble. She\u2019s never run for public office before, she\u2019s not well-known even in Georgia political circles and she\u2019s already under attack by some Collins allies who question her support for Trump and her past contributions to Democrats. Cillizza: Does Kemp\u2019s resistance to Trump\u2019s wishes surprise you? Bluestein: Nope. I\u2019ve covered him since his run for state Senate in 2002 and he\u2019s always been willing to buck the establishment, whether it be the Democratic-led system in his hometown of Athens or an underdog campaign against the powerful GOP front-runner in last year\u2019s race. After Trump\u2019s endorsement of Kemp\u2019s gubernatorial bid last year, the candidate\u2019s advisers were clear: No deal was cut to ensure the President\u2019s support. I was skeptical at the time, but this is proof positive that Kemp made no secret deal. But the governor and his advisers have also tried to frame his impending selection of Loeffler not as defiance of Trump and the White House but a fight against a \u201cridiculous\u201d establishment bent on trying to tell a duly elected governor what to do. That\u2019s why the criticism from out-of-state advocates could play into his hand. Kemp\u2019s camp went nuclear against Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz over the weekend after he questioned whether the governor needed a Trump-backed primary challenge in 2022 \u2013 making the Floridian a collective enemy instead of the Georgia-based critics. They\u2019re trying to make this a Georgia vs. Washington/Florida battle \u2013 which, in their mind, bodes well for the home team. Cillizza: What\u2019s the political impact here \u2013 for Kemp and for the Senate appointee/Senate race? Bluestein: Well, the biggest immediate question is whether Collins runs for Senate anyway. He told me about two weeks ago that he was \u201cstrongly\u201d considering a bid if he\u2019s not tapped \u2013 a move that would spark a bitter Republican clash at a time when the Georgia GOP can ill afford it. Unlike traditional elections that have primaries to hash out Democratic and Republican nominees, the race to fill the remaining two years of Isakson\u2019s term is a wide-open special election that features multiple candidates from all parties on the same ballot. The prospect of multiple well-funded Republicans slicing into each other\u2019s bases on a November ballot raises the likelihood of a January 2021 runoff if no candidate gets a majority of the vote \u2013 and the possibility that a Democrat who consolidates party support can win the contest outright. Collins\u2019 supporters firmly believe he could out-poll Loeffler and earn a spot in a runoff by energizing conservatives and dominating his north Georgia district \u2013 home of the biggest trove of Republican primary voters in the state. But Loeffler is likely to start spending cash \u2013 quickly \u2013 to drive up her name ID and shore up the GOP base. Some analysts predict she\u2019ll spend at least $10 million of her own cash to defend the seat, but that remains to be seen. It\u2019s also an important test that could shape the remaining three years of Kemp\u2019s term. Polls show his approval ratings on the rise, and his support for new anti-abortion restrictions have enraged Democrats but helped endear him to conservatives. A misfire here, though, could irreparably damage his standing. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cPolitically speaking, the best Senate pick for Republicans in Georgia is ______________.\u201d Now, explain. Bluestein: \u201cTotally dependent on how you view the Georgia GOP\u2019s future.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s a cop-out, but let me explain. Doug Collins is the safer choice. He\u2019s a proven fundraiser with a deep well of support among conservatives who has been tested in Washington and Georgia and thoroughly vetted. He\u2019s a sharp-tongued attorney who has gone to the mat for the President and battles Democrats daily on cable TV and in committee rooms. It\u2019s hard to see anyone trying to outflank him on the right, and he\u2019s also racked up some bipartisan bona fides. He\u2019s also a white male in a Georgia GOP almost entirely dominated by white men. And for a governor who styles himself as an outsider, Collins is probably uncomfortably close with what he considers the \u201cestablishment\u201d that refused to back him last year. By picking Loeffler, he\u2019s placing a bet that the newcomer can help give state Republicans a different sort of brand to compete against resurgent Democrats. We\u2019re not quite sure what that brand will be yet, but her application for the seat \u2013 submitted hours before a deadline \u2013 offers some clues. \u201cFrom working on the family farm to creating jobs and opportunity in the business world, I have been blessed to live the American Dream,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am offering myself to serve hardworking Georgians as a political outsider in the United States Senate to protect that dream for everyone.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans have held dominion over Georgia\u2019s political landscape for decades, dominating state government while, every four years, comfortably collecting its presidential electoral votes. No Democratic presidential nominee has won a general election here since Bill Clinton did it in 1992. He lost the state during his successful reelection bid in 1996 and Republicans, even as Hillary Clinton narrowed the margin in 2016, haven\u2019t felt serious pressure since. Until now. For the first time in a generation, Democrats have reason to believe that Georgia could be a true swing state in the coming presidential contest. Many of the 2020 candidates, who are in Atlanta this week for Wednesday\u2019s debate, either visited the state last year or are making the most of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s decision to bring the primary down south \u2013 with a handful either turning up early or sticking around late to immerse themselves in the local politics. On Thursday, at least three will join Stacey Abrams at Ebenezer Baptist Church to text and call voters slated to be scrubbed from the state\u2019s rolls. Georgia\u2019s emergence on the 2020 Democrats\u2019 electoral maps has been powered in large part by a backlash to President Donald Trump, particularly in the suburbs. His time in office has also spurred a nationwide renaissance among the liberal grassroots, which, in their despair at Trump\u2019s election, got busy organizing and demanding the party engage in places the conventional wisdom had long dismissed as unwinnable. The Georgia GOP has also played its role in the Democratic resurgence. The state has so far refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this year signed a so-called \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d one of the country\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws \u2013 another move likely to alienate moderate suburban voters. The fruits of Democrats\u2019 post-2016 efforts, and anger over what\u2019s happened since, has already begun to ripen. Stacey Abrams in 2018 fell just short of becoming the first African American woman elected governor of Georgia. At the same time, Democrat Lucy McBath ousted the incumbent Republican Rep. Karen Handel in the suburban 6th congressional district, claiming a seat that had previously been held by high profile GOP lawmakers like Newt Gingrich, Johnny Isakson and Tom Price. Abrams\u2019 2018 election strategy, which focused in large part on mobilizing Democrats who had been written off as unlikely voters, got her to within about 55,000 votes of victory \u2013 a narrow margin her campaign and civil rights groups have argued was the corrupt product of a system put in place by Kemp, who served before and during the race as secretary of state. Despite falling short last year, Abrams has emerged as one of the Democratic party\u2019s foremost political stars. Her decision not to run for president \u2013 instead launching a voting rights organization, Fair Fight \u2013 only strengthened her standing. Former President Barack Obama aside, hers is one of the most desired endorsements in the 2020 primary. \u201cNext year, Georgia will be the premier battleground state in the country,\u201d Abrams declared in a September memo, titled \u201cThe Abrams Playbook,\u201d issued through Fair Fight. \u201cOur 16 electoral votes are in play, and we are the only state in the country set to have two U.S. Senate races. Also up for grabs will be two hotly-contested suburban congressional seats and control of the state house. Georgia faces historic electoral opportunities, and Democrats cannot achieve success nationally without competing and winning in Georgia.\u201d The stakes are undeniable. But the question remains: After so many false dawns, can Democrats finally make inroads into the Deep South? Sarah Riggs Amico, who is running in a contested primary for a shot at unseating Republican Sen. David Perdue in 2020, was the party\u2019s nominee for lieutenant governor in 2018. Combined with Abrams \u2013 though they both lost \u2013 she helped dramatically increase Democratic turnout in the state. \u201cI sat in an awful lot of living rooms (during the last campaign) and I can tell you, nobody\u2019s happy about having 79 counties without an OB-GYN or 64 without a pediatrician, or the highest maternal mortality rate in America,\u201d Amico said of the state, arguing that Democrats have an opportunity, if they drill down on those difficult issues, to win over people who have either voted Republican or not at all. \u201cIf we do those things, we can win. Look what we did last year and there was an awful lot of shenanigans at the ballot box that probably prevented Stacey from being governor.\u201d Abrams\u2019 eventual defeat, in a campaign that Kemp, as secretary of state, administered and was marked by his controversial past purging of voter rolls, faulty voting machines and the rejection of absentee ballots, only bolstered her standing with Democrats. And so, Abrams\u2019 power in Georgia \u2013 in addition to her national profile \u2013 have grown apace. Whether she is campaigning here for the eventual Democratic nominee, or on the ticket herself as a vice presidential candidate, her influence should be estimable. Her endorsement could also shake up the primary. \u201cI think the default option for black voters right now is Joe Biden,\u201d University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said. \u201cBut if Abrams were to come out and endorse someone else, I think that would result in a number of black voters taking a serious second look at whoever it was she threw her support behind.\u201d The fate of the party in Georgia next year, Bullock added, could ride on her appeal. \u201cPart of this comes down to how much can Abrams translate or transfer her popularity to whoever the Democrats have nominated,\u201d he said. A lot of that will, of course, be dependent on the name at the top of the ticket. But Democrats like Abrams\u2019 2018 campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo, who has since become the CEO of Abram\u2019s Fair Fight Action, are also looking at demographics \u2013 and liking what they see. \u201cThe fact that Georgia\u2019s population is changing and growing are related but distinct trends,\u201d Groh-Wargo wrote in the Fair Fight memo that was introduced by Abrams. \u201cVoters of all races who had lived in Georgia for less than 10 years voted for Stacey Abrams by a whopping 30-point margin, 65% to 35%, according to a CNN exit poll. Each person who moves to Georgia and votes is almost twice as likely to vote Democratic than Republican.\u201d Democrats may be gaining in confidence, but here as in the rest of the country, there is some anxiety over the shape and tone of a national primary campaign that has yet to produce a clear frontrunner amid fiery intra-party ideological battles. Quentin James, the founder and executive director of Collective PAC, a national organization that recruits and trains African American candidates, warned that Georgia Democrats face the same potential hurdles as their colleagues around the country. \u201cRight now, nationally, you see this conversation around liberal versus moderate. It\u2019s really hard to talk about the dichotomy of those two things in Georgia, because you look at Stacey Abrams, who people will say is a progressive, but that may mean something different in Georgia than Massachusetts,\u201d James said. Abrams bridged that gap, such as it exists in Georgia, during her gubernatorial run. In the general, Kemp and Republicans tried to frame her as a radical leftist, a caricature that mostly fell flat for the simple reason it was demonstrably false \u2013 having served as state House minority leader, Abrams had a record to prove it. On a national stage, in this presidential primary, she would have likely fit more closely with the moderates. For James, who expressed qualified concerns over all the leading campaigns, the Abrams appeal is one that all Democrats should strive to replicate \u2013 if they want to win in a state like Georgia. \u201cShe spoke to Georgia voters in a way that was inspiring and the reason that she is being talked about as a possible VP nominee is because, in doing so and talking to Georgia voters, in no way did she sell her soul to motivate voters,\u201d James said. \u201cIn no way did she capitulate on progressive issues to get out rural voters. There\u2019s a way you can talk about health care that doesn\u2019t alienate folks who either want to keep it or don\u2019t have it. There is a middle ground here and middle ground is not a bad word.\u201d",

            "article_content": "More than $166,000 in contributions, mailings and digital ads to help a political newcomer take on a Republican incumbent in a Richmond-area Senate district. More than $146,000 to help an Air Force veteran seek an open Senate seat in a fast-growing suburban county. About $75,000 to target the only Republican representing Northern Virginia in the state\u2019s House of Delegates. On Tuesday in Virginia, all three seats flipped from Republican to Democrat \u2013 after a $2.5 million spending spree in the state by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group aligned with billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The investments made the Bloomberg-affiliated organization the largest outside spender in the elections that saw Democrats take control of the state\u2019s executive and legislative branches for the first time in a generation. Everytown officials \u2013 who provided CNN with details of their Virginia strategy \u2013 say their approach to the off-year election demonstrates the potency of the gun-safety message one year before the nation heads to the polls to decide control of Congress and the White House. The spending also underscores how aggressively the deep-pocketed group will pursue its agenda in the months ahead. Everytown outspent the embattled National Rifle Association by roughly 8-to-1 in Virginia, plowing money into the state to target vulnerable Republicans months in advance of Tuesday\u2019s election. \u201cGun safety will be one of the defining issues of 2020,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown. Virginia Republicans went into Tuesday\u2019s election defending paper-thin majorities: 20-19 in the state Senate and 51-48 in the House of Delegates, with a vacancy in each chamber. Everytown and the Democrats they backed made guns a key issue, following a mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building on May 31 that left 12 people dead. The state\u2019s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam ordered a special session of the General Assembly in July to take up an array of gun-control bills, but the Republican leadership abruptly ended the session 90 minutes after it started without considering a single bill. Even before the session began, Everytown strategists began polling to determine which Virginia races would be the most competitive in November should the General Assembly fail to act, said Charlie Kelly, a veteran Democratic strategist who works as a senior adviser to the group. Soon after the adjournment, the group began a digital advertising blitz to target Republicans, particularly in suburban swing districts. \u201cThey made their choice to side with the gun lobby,\u201d Feinblatt said. Everytown\u2019s spending came as the NRA faces intense scrutiny and legal battles with its former advertising agency. The gun lobby\u2019s finances are under investigation by attorneys general in New York and Washington. NRA officials this week said it\u2019s not uncommon for Bloomberg-funded groups to outspend them in politics and insisted their membership ranks remained strongly committed to the gun-rights cause. \u201cAnti-gun organizations are backed by distant billionaires, not local interests,\u201d Jason Ouimet, head of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. \u201cThese elitists funnel money into our communities to prop-up weak candidates defined by one trait: their willingness to bow to the billionaire\u2019s gun control agenda, even if it turns great places-like Virginia-into New York City.\u201d By Election Day, Everytown and its grassroots arm, Moms Demand Action, had endorsed Democrats in 25 races. Moms Demand Action volunteers made more than 100,000 calls to voters, Everytown officials said Wednesday. Everytown\u2019s heaviest spending went to 15 contests. Those ranged from Washington\u2019s outer suburbs where Democratic state Delegate and Air Force vet John Bell captured an open Senate seat that long had been held by Republicans to the Richmond area, where first-time candidate Ghazala Hashmi ousted a Republican incumbent to become the first Muslim elected to Virginia\u2019s state Senate. Virginia campaign laws allow outside groups to coordinate directly with candidates and political parties, so Everytown was free to co-produce candidate ads with hyper-local messages. In Bell\u2019s case, Everytown underwrote $75,000 in TV advertising. In one ad, Bell proposed increasing the distance between firing ranges and private homes, highlighting recent incidents in his fast-growing suburban area where stray bullets from private ranges have hit homes. Everytown also spent more than $67,000 to aid Democrat Shelly Simonds, who gained national attention in 2017 after a tie with her Republican opponent David Yancey was decided by a random draw out of a bowl. Yancey won the draw two years ago. On Tuesday, Simonds won the rematch by a wide margin. As of early Wednesday morning, Everytown-favored candidates had won in eight of the 15 races and lost in three. Four still were too close to call. Among the biggest losses: The group\u2019s attempt to topple Virginia\u2019s Republican House Speaker Kirk Cox. Everytown spent more than $184,000 in that race. Cox survived the onslaught but will have to surrender his leadership position now that Democrats will control the chamber. While Everytown emerged as one of the biggest players in Virginia\u2019s legislative races, other liberal groups also invested heavily in the state\u2019s races. EMILY\u2019s List, which backs Democratic female candidates who support abortion rights, teamed up with a leading Democratic political action committee, Priorities USA, to spend more than $2 million in Virginia. A Washington Post poll last month found that gun policy had emerged as the top concern in Virginia, with 75% of registered voters saying it would be a \u201cvery important\u201d issue as they cast their ballots in legislative contests. This story has been updated with additional information provided by Everytown for Gun Safety Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "He made up a story about President Barack Obama trying \u201c11 times\u201d to call Kim Jong Un. He expressed suspicion of Obama\u2019s post-presidency Netflix deal and book deal. He claimed he, \u201cnot Obama,\u201d captured ISIS prisoners. President Donald Trump mentioned his predecessor\u2019s name 10 times in one Cabinet meeting two weeks ago. All 10 were unprompted. Trump has had a years-long fixation with Obama that predates his presidential campaign. But it has appeared to intensify in recent months, at least judging by the frequency of his public disparagement. October capped a five-month stretch in which Trump talked or tweeted about Obama far more than he did at any other point in his presidency. Trump used Obama\u2019s name 106 times in June, the most of any month of his presidency; 80 times in October, his third-highest monthly total; 68 times in July, his fourth-highest monthly total; 61 times in August, his fifth-highest monthly total; and 51 times in September, his ninth-highest monthly total. Over the five-month period, Trump mentioned Obama an average of 2.4 times per day. If you add in his 69 mentions of the \u201cprevious administration\u201d or \u201clast administration,\u201d it was 2.8 times per day. Through October, Trump had mentioned Obama by name 537 times during 2019 as a whole \u2013 an average of 1.8 times per day. That\u2019s a 36% increase from the 395 mentions (1.3 per day) Trump made of Obama in 2018 through October of that year and a 169% increase from the 200 mentions in 2017 (0.7 per day) through October of that year. All of the data in this article is courtesy of Bill Frischling of Factba.se, the excellent website that tracks all of Trump\u2019s public utterances. The increasing frequency of Trump\u2019s Obama-bashing has coincided with a general increase in the amount Trump has spoken, both to reporters and at his campaign rallies. As he has unshackled himself from prepared texts and stern handlers, he has appeared to reveal his true sentiments more freely. Trump has escalated his attacks on Obama even as Obama has stayed largely quiet about him. Obama did blast Trump during the midterm election campaign, and he has criticized particular Trump policies on rare occasions, but he has generally refused to respond to Trump\u2019s barrage of derision. True to form, Obama\u2019s office declined to comment on how much Trump has been commenting on him. It\u2019s not clear how much of Trump\u2019s Obama-bashing is personal and instinctual \u2013 Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson has argued that Trump has a \u201cchronic and debilitating case of Obama envy\u201d \u2013 and how much is political and strategic. The White House and the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for an explanation. During Obama\u2019s first term, Trump burnished his following among Republican voters by becoming a leading promoter of the racist conspiracy theory that Obama was an illegitimate president because he supposedly was not actually born in the United States. During his campaign of 2015 and 2016, Trump again excited the party faithful with scathing, exaggerated denunciations of Obama. \u201cTrump jump-started his political career by claiming then-President Obama was not an American. Beyond subscribing to that racist conspiracy theory, President Trump also knows that attacking Obama gins up his base and solidifies support for him by comparison,\u201d said Christina Reynolds, who served as director of media affairs early in the Obama administration and is now vice-president of communications at EMILY\u2019s LIST, which works to elect female Democrats who support abortion rights. \u201cAt a point when some Republicans are starting to openly question him, he seems to be going to back to the old classics, so to speak.\u201d Jon Favreau, the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast co-host who served as White House director of speechwriting for Obama, said he \u201ccannot see the political wisdom\u201d in attacking someone as popular as Obama \u201cwho\u2019s not even your opponent.\u201d In an August poll by Fox News, 60% of registered voters had a favorable opinion of Obama; 41% had a favorable opinion of Trump. Favreau said Trump \u201cof course never offered a word of criticism when he actually met President Obama during the transition, because he\u2019s a coward in person.\u201d \u201cBut he always needs multiple enemies on the stump, and he must hate that his predecessor is wildly popular and he\u2019s wildly unpopular,\u201d Favreau said. Following their post-election meeting in the Oval Office on November 11, 2016, Trump referred to Obama as a \u201cvery good man.\u201d It\u2019s not only the frequency of Trump\u2019s mentions of Obama that stands out \u2013 it\u2019s the palpable disdain he exudes for his predecessor. Many of Trump\u2019s references are dripping with contempt. Four times since August, he has publicly wondered why people consider Obama a \u201cgreat president.\u201d At a campaign rally in Mississippi on Friday night, Trump claimed he had beaten not only the \u201cBush dynasty\u201d and \u201cClinton dynasty\u201d but the \u201cPresident Barack Hussein Obama dynasty\u201d \u2013 and said the only time he has ever seen Obama \u201cwork hard\u201d was when Obama campaigned against him. \u201cHe was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama,\u201d Trump claimed, at an August press conference, about Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region. \u201cI want to thank you, President Obama, for giving me 142 open judges. How you allowed that to happen is beyond me. It\u2019s beyond me,\u201d Trump said in a speech to a police conference on Monday \u2013 exaggerating by 38 the number of judicial vacancies he inherited from Obama and ignoring the role of Senate Republicans\u2019 obstruction. \u201cWe just got al-Baghdadi \u2013 which President Obama was trying to get for a long time, and he was unable to get,\u201d Trump said in an interview with ABC 7 Chicago the same day. While it is normal for sitting presidents to refer at least occasionally to their predecessors or vanquished opponents, Factba.se data suggests no other recent president came anywhere close to Trump\u2019s regularity. From June 1983 to October 1983, the same period of Republican President Ronald Reagan\u2019s tenure, Factba.se counted 16 times Reagan mentioned his predecessor and defeated Democratic opponent, President Jimmy Carter, or spoke of the \u201cprevious administration\u201d or \u201clast administration.\u201d From June 2011 to October 2011, Factba.se found only one mention from Obama of his Republican predecessor George W. Bush or the Bush administration \u2013 and it was positive. On the 10-year anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Obama said, \u201cAfter 9/11, to his great credit, President Bush made clear what we reaffirm today: the United States will never wage war against Islam or any other religion.\u201d Trump, conversely, mentioned Obama, the Obama administration or defeated opponent Hillary Clinton 462 times between June and October of this year \u2013 not including mentions on Twitter, which obviously didn\u2019t exist for Reagan.",

            "article_content": "Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, is facing off against opponents from both political parties in Saturday\u2019s jungle gubernatorial primary, in which all candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run against each other. If Edwards can emerge with greater than 50% of the vote, he\u2019ll win reelection outright. If he doesn\u2019t, a runoff will be held in November between the two top vote getters. Polling and other factors suggest that, despite Louisiana\u2019s Republican lean, Edwards has a decent shot of being reelected. Edwards won office back in 2015 on somewhat of a fluke. Polling showed him only clearly beating one Republican in a runoff, scandal-ridden David Vitter, and Vitter was the Republican who managed to secure a runoff spot alongside Edwards. Edwards was helped by then-Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal driving up the state budget deficit and provided the political environment for Edwards to win. Still, whether he won on a fluke or not four years ago, Edwards\u2019 2019 polling has been fairly good. In an average of polls taken since the beginning of the month, Edwards earns 47% of the vote. Republican businessman Eddie Rispone gets 22%. Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham gets 20%. The other minor candidates are averaging 3%. That leaves Edwards just short of a majority, though an additional 8% say they are undecided. Indeed, the big question is what happens with those undecided voters. Some of them may be undecided because they aren\u2019t sure which of the two major Republicans to vote for. President Donald Trump held a rally in Louisiana Friday night to merely telling voters not to cast a vote for Edwards. If a disproportionate number of undecideds go to one of the Republican candidates, then Edwards will fall short of 50%. If, however, the undecideds go proportionally toward the candidates, Edwards will clear 50% and avoid a runoff. Even if a runoff were to occur, Edwards would start off, at worst, a 50-50 proposition to win. He\u2019s up at least 9 points and getting to at least 50% in hypothetical one-on-ones against Abraham and Rispone in an average of polls taken this month. Of course, the lack of multiple high profile Republicans in a runoff means that any Republican would be able to focus their attacks on Edwards. Either Abraham or Rispone wouldn\u2019t have to be fending off the other, as they are in the primary. You can easily imagine Trump coming in for another pre-election rally ahead of the runoff, which could be more effective, as he would be endorsing one candidate instead of anti-endorsing one. Louisiana is still a red state after all. Trump won it by 20 points in 2016 and could turn the tide in a close race. It would be a mistake, though, to assume a red state like Louisiana wouldn\u2019t re-elect a Democratic governor, even in the era of Trump. Voters are more likely to split the ballot if a candidate fits their state like the culturally conservative, anti-abortion, pro-gun Edwards. Democrats have been elected or re-elected governor in red states such as Kansas, Montana and West Virginia when Trump was either on the ballot or in office. Trump won all of those states by 20 points or more in 2016. Likewise, there have been a slew of Republicans either elected or re-elected in deep blue states such as Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont. A simple model that doesn\u2019t look at the polls and only at patterns that emerged from 2018 gubernatorial races suggests Edwards may actually be a slight favorite. Using the 2018 elections as a benchmark, the model looks at the relationship between the outcome of gubernatorial elections, the state\u2019s 2016 presidential vote and whether an incumbent is running. This simple model projects Edwards winning re-election about two-thirds of the time. Obviously, that leaves one-third of the time he doesn\u2019t win. That means the 2019 Louisiana gubernatorial race is well within the margin of error, and there\u2019s still a lot to be determined in the home state of Popeye\u2019s. Given Louisiana\u2019s deep red lean, this is probably something Democrats don\u2019t mind.",

            "article_content": "Planned Parenthood\u2019s super PAC kicked off a $45 million electoral program targeted toward battleground states for the 2020 election, the reproductive rights giant announced on Wednesday. The funding effort, launched by Planned Parenthood Votes, clocks in at more than triple what the group spent during the last presidential election year and eight times what it spent during the 2018 midterms \u2013 a telling sign of Planned Parenthood\u2019s anticipated full court press in the coming election after recent state and federal efforts to curtail reproductive rights including abortion. The group\u2019s self-identified largest program to date will go toward \u201clarge-scale grassroots organizing programs and targeted canvass, digital, television, radio and mail programs,\u201d according to a press release. Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will all be focuses of the initiative, per the release. \u201cWho we elect will determine our access to birth control, cancer screenings, sex education, abortion access and more,\u201d said Kelley Robinson, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why Planned Parenthood Votes will use every tool at our disposal to hit the pavement, flood the airwaves, and elect reproductive rights champions up and down the ballot,\u201d she added. \u201cWe know this is a fight we can win.\u201d The super PAC pledged to back reproductive rights candidates \u201cfrom the White House to the Senate to statehouses and ballot initiatives across the country,\u201d indicating a state level focus after a year that saw a slew of pre-viability abortion restrictions coming out of conservative state legislatures. Planned Parenthood is among the plaintiffs in lawsuits challenging such laws in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio. Anti-abortion leaders decried Planned Parenthood\u2019s election efforts, accusing the group of looking to protect its own finances and lamenting its federal subsidies. Planned Parenthood received $563.8 million in government funding in 2018, according to its annual report. Lila Rose, president of anti-abortion group Live Action, slammed the funding effort as a display of \u201cruthless prioritization of politics and their bottom line over women\u2019s health care.\u201d March for Life President Jeanne Mancini said in a statement that the funding effort was unsurprising \u201cbecause this Administration has implemented a pro-life agenda in many areas, including the Protecting Life in Global Health Policy and new Title X regulations, both of which impacted Planned Parenthood\u2019s bottom line.\u201d \u201cIt is unfair to force Americans to subsidize through their tax dollars this partisan political organization bent on electing pro-abortion politicians,\u201d she added. This year, Planned Parenthood rejected some federal funding. The group decided to drop Title X funding in August after the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Trump administration rule blocking recipient providers from discussing abortion services with patients. HHS told recipients in July that the rule would go into effect despite several pending challenges. CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s last-minute September meeting with the Ukrainian President has pulled him into a mess he has worked hard to avoid: a crisis involving his boss, President Donald Trump. Rather than traveling to Warsaw, Poland, last month to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump decided to stay home to track the damage from Hurricane Dorian. In his place he sent Pence, whose face-to-face meeting with Zelensky now puts him at the heart of events that led to the impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives. Trump isn\u2019t making it easy for Pence to distance himself, even suggesting that the details of Pence\u2019s phone calls and conversations with Zelensky should be released. \u201cI think you should ask for Vice President Pence\u2019s conversation, because he had a couple conversations also,\u201d Trump told reporters last week after the release of the White House transcript of his own July 25 call with Zelensky. On Wednesday, The Washington Post reported that Trump has involved Pence on multiple fronts in his interaction with Ukraine. Pence did not mention to Zelensky the President\u2019s unfounded allegations against Joe Biden in regard to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the situation. \u201cThere was no reason to bring up Biden,\u201d the person says. Pence aides maintain that when he went to Warsaw he was unaware of the Biden allegations being made by the President\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. But one of the vice president\u2019s top aides had listened in on the call the President had with Ukraine\u2019s leader, according to a source familiar with the matter, confirming a report in The Washington Post. Instead, according to one of the sources, the vice president spoke broadly about corruption in Ukraine and received assurances from Zelensky that he would crack down on it. Pence took that message back to Trump and helped convince him to release the aid to Ukraine, according to three senior administration officials. That, along with pressure from Congress, was a key factor in Trump\u2019s decision to finally support the release of $391 million to Ukraine after a months-long delay on the money, these sources say. \u201cThe President consistently raised concerns about corruption and the lack of burden sharing by European partners, so having run on an anti-corruption campaign, Zelensky was receptive to those messages,\u201d said Marc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cThe vice president reported back to the President after the meeting and the aid was released.\u201d \u201cWe do not comment on conversations between the President and the vice president,\u201d Short said. Recent conversations with a person close to the matter reveal a deep level of anxiety inside the vice president\u2019s office. Pence advisers are frustrated with how the White House has handled the fallout from the Ukraine disclosures, including bringing the vice president into the mess. An additional Pence adviser tells CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s a challenging environment,\u201d in response to the controversies and scandals the vice president has had to dodge, most recently Ukraine. There is also concern within Pence\u2019s team over his standing with Trump. Publicly Trump has consistently praised the vice president, insisting Pence will be his running mate next year, yet privately he is more circumspect. One person close to Trump says he is cagey when it comes to whether he will keep Pence on the ticket, always cautious not to tip his hand one way or another. One Pence adviser pushed back on that, telling CNN that privately Trump has asked Pence to stay on the ticket. Regardless, the challenge for Pence, as it\u2019s always been, is balancing the need to appear loyal to Trump with staying clear of the President\u2019s countless controversies. The plan to protect him, according to sources close to the vice president, is to get him on the road. On Wednesday Pence traveled to Arizona, where he attended events in Tucson and Scottsdale alongside Republican Sen. Martha McSally. This strategy is largely in keeping with the traveling envoy role Pence has inhabited for much of the past year. During the spring and summer, he was busy flying around the country to talk up the administration\u2019s North American trade deal, the USMCA. From March through August, Pence attended 26 separate events, from CEO roundtables to Midwestern factories. Interviews over the past several months with more than 15 sources shed light on what was always a forced union between Pence and the President. Pence remains a crucial link for Trump to evangelicals, a segment of the Republican base he will need in 2020. Yet temperamentally, the careful and scrupulous vice president couldn\u2019t be more different from a commander in chief who prefers to make decisions on the fly. \u201cWhenever the vice president does anything with foreign leaders, he is totally buttoned up \u2013 prepared note cards, legal (advisers) present,\u201d a source familiar with the matter said. \u201cHe has always been squeaky clean,\u201d the source added, drawing a contrast with Trump\u2019s more freewheeling style on the calls. Beyond their political relationship, Trump and Pence have little in common. Pence, hardly a scratch golfer, has only recently taken up the game Trump loves. While Trump frequently starts his day turning on cable news and firing up his Twitter feed, Pence begins each morning reading his Bible. In his 2019 book \u201cLet Me Finish,\u201d former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie describes brokering the first meeting between the men at the governor\u2019s mansion in Indianapolis shortly before the Indiana primary in March 2016. At the end of their meeting, Pence surprised Trump by asking the small group to join hands and pray. \u201cDoes he do that all the time?\u201d Trump asked Christie afterward. When Christie told him yes, the New Jersey Republican says, Trump responded with one word: \u201cInteresting.\u201d As the midterm election returns came in on the night of November 6, 2018, Trump began asking people, \u201cDo you think Pence is good for me?\u201d While Trump didn\u2019t overtly criticize Pence that night, it was clear that the President was wondering what Pence contributes to his coalition. A close ally of Trump\u2019s stressed to him that Pence\u2019s steady presence and even keel made him the perfect running mate and vice president. The ally likened Pence to \u201ca sommelier who doesn\u2019t drink.\u201d Trump seems to have listened, jokingly asking in his post-election news conference the next day if Pence would be his running mate in 2020. Pence stood up and wordlessly agreed to do so. \u201cThank you, OK, good,\u201d Trump said. For a President who values personal loyalty above all, Pence has been nothing if not publicly and privately devoted to Trump. He has not spoken out to counter or undercut Trump \u2013 not following the President\u2019s comments after Charlottesville, not during Trump\u2019s attacks on members of his Cabinet and not when Trump criticized Paul Ryan, one of Pence\u2019s closest friends from his time in Congress. One source who once worked in the White House with the vice president says the guiding principle for Pence is unwavering fealty, in recognition that he would not be in power without Trump. Pence\u2019s model is George H.W. Bush, who loyally served alongside Ronald Reagan without any daylight between the two former rivals. The source says that if Pence has disagreements with Trump, he shares them privately. Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, told CNN late last year that the vice president has avoided pushing forward his own pet projects or issues. \u201cHe would never say, \u2018Here\u2019s my agenda and here\u2019s how it fits in.\u2019 He\u2019s going to support the Trump agenda,\u201d said Short. Moreover, Pence has taken on tasks that might be less interesting to Trump, such as international trips and leading the charge to create the Space Force division at the Pentagon. The idea, from the vice president\u2019s perspective, is to do whatever he can to endear himself to Trump. Most endearing \u2013 or at least the most valuable \u2013 to the President may be Pence\u2019s direct link to the GOP\u2019s social conservative wing. As a House member, Pence was active in a congressional Bible study and cultivated relationships with the politically active evangelical network in the nation\u2019s capital. People in that network say Pence is a key \u201cI found Mike Pence to be one of the like-minded and one of the most reliable people that I could work with in the Congress,\u201d said Dr. Richard Land, the president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary who was the longtime head of the public policy office of the Southern Baptist Convention. \u201cHe cared about the things that I as a Southern Baptist and the majority of Southern Baptists cared about.\u201d Pence\u2019s record and reputation have continually prompted questions of how a devout Christian could continue supporting a President accused of having multiple extramarital affairs. Trump has denied having affairs with his accusers. Even those who have worked closely with Pence for years say he and Karen Pence are buttoned up on their true feelings about Trump\u2019s moral failings. One clue comes from Jane Mayer of the New Yorker, who reported in October 2017 that Pence sent a letter to Trump just after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape a month before Election Day 2016. Pence told the Republican nominee that he and his wife were offended by Trump\u2019s comments on the tape and wanted to reassess Pence\u2019s placement on the ticket. However serious Pence was at that moment, those concerns appeared to have been allayed shortly thereafter. Publicly, Pence went on to say he was \u201cgrateful that [Trump] expressed remorse\u201d for the comments on the video, and he remained on the ticket. If the President keeps Pence on the ticket through 2020, as expected, it will be for the political utility he provides Trump. He\u2019s already resumed the role of top Trump campaign surrogate as the 2020 reelection effort ramps up, working to woo the traditional groups like donors and trade groups to the Keep America Great cause. What remains Pence\u2019s competitive advantage is his long-standing connections with the broader conservative movement, which remains an integral part of the Republican coalition. Pence is a particularly important bridge to the politically active evangelical community, that network of activists and donors that has prioritized issues like abortion, religious freedom and judicial nominations. \u201cI would say that it\u2019s a wonderful thing to have someone of Mike Pence\u2019s caliber and integrity as vice president of the United States,\u201d said Tim Goeglein, a White House official under George W. Bush and a vice president at Focus on the Family. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good and very helpful thing that we can express our views to someone who shares our views on things like human life and on issues of judges and the Supreme Court and other issues of that nature.\u201d Goeglein, who has known Pence for 25 years, said the vice president has been one of the most important champions for evangelicals in Washington in years. \u201cHe\u2019s someone we know and someone who we trust,\u201d Goeglein said. A member of the Trump campaign\u2019s evangelical advisory board in 2016, Richard Land recalled being asked that summer what his first piece of advice for the Republican candidate would be. Without hesitation, Land answered, \u201cPick Mike Pence.\u201d \u201cIt was the first thing that popped into my mind, because I could think of nothing which could more assure evangelicals that they were going to have a seat at the table in the Trump administration than making Mike Pence his vice president,\u201d Land told CNN. Neither Goeglein nor Land put much stock in the idea that Trump might replace Pence, though the latter says he fears doing so could hurt the President among evangelical voters. \u201cThat would be a problem,\u201d said Land. \u201cI think it might depress [turnout] some.\u201d That might be enough reason for Trump to keep Pence around, but Pence offers one more critical benefit to the President: his willingness to completely submit himself to Trump and his agenda. \u201cHe\u2019s very loyal to the President,\u201d said Pence\u2019s close friend, former Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. \u201cHe\u2019s always had a kind of orientation to authority.\u201d This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger and Elizabeth Landers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As the Supreme Court justices prepare to take their seats next week to start a new term, they will meet behind closed doors Tuesday to discuss how they\u2019ll handle one of the most explosive issues running into the 2020 election: Abortion. Conservative states, emboldened by a newly solidified conservative majority on the court, are hoping the justices will green-light state restrictions that opponents say could have far-reaching consequences and potentially weaken Supreme Court precedent including the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the US. As early as this week, the justices could decide whether to take up two cases out of Indiana and Louisiana and they may  indicate how they will address a slew of other challenges springing up in conservative states across the county. Additionally, the Court will consider an abortion-related case from Chicago concerning the First Amendment rights of so called \u201csidewalk counselors\u201d who stand outside abortion clinics hoping to deter women from going inside. Liberals are looking at the docket fearful of what could come next now that moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy has been replaced by the more conservative Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the leading liberal on the Court, said last spring that  Kennedy\u2019s retirement was the event \u201cof greatest consequence for the current term, and perhaps for many terms ahead.\u201d On the other side of the bench, Justice Clarence Thomas \u2013 who believes that Roe was wrongly decided \u2013 has made clear that he thinks there is no such right in the Constitution. Last term he sent a warning shot to his colleagues about his stance in a separate case. \u201cThe Constitution itself is silent on abortion,\u201d he wrote. How the justices deal with the cases before them will send a strong signal about how far and how fast the conservatives on the court want to go. \u201cThe stakes are incredibly high this term,\u201d said Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project who is behind the challenge in the Indiana case. The 2014 Louisiana law requires doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where the abortion is performed. It is nearly identical to a Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016. Back then, Kennedy joined with the liberal justices to rule against the law. Thomas, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito were in dissent. Since that ruling, however, the composition of the Court has changed with the addition of President Donald Trump\u2019s picks Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Now liberals are worried that the newly comprised court will either undo the Texas ruling or distinguish it from the facts in the Louisiana case and allow the Louisiana law. The Center for Reproductive Rights, representing an abortion clinic and two Louisiana physicians, argues that if the law is allowed to go into effect is will leave \u201conly one doctor to care for every woman seeking an abortion in the state.\u201d A federal appeals court upheld the law, but Roberts sided last February with his four liberal colleagues to put it on hold until all nine justices could consider whether to take up an appeal. Critics of the Louisiana law fear that although Roberts took their side on the emergency stay, he may not rule the same way if the full case is before him and the conservatives have the opportunity, through a reasoned opinion, to distinguish the Louisiana law from the 2016 ruling. Louisiana argues that the law is necessary to provide a higher level of physician competence, but critics say there is no medical justification for the law and it amounts to a veiled attempt to unlawfully restrict abortion. The case is \u201cthe big ticket item when it comes to abortion cases this term,\u201d TJ Tu, senior counsel for litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in an interview. He views the case as  \u201ca major test of the Supreme Court\u2019s commitment to both the rule of law and its abortion precedent.\u201d \u201cUnless the Supreme Court acts, abortion access is going to be decimated,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cif precedent means anything, a law that was unconstitutional in Texas in 2016 has to be unconstitutional in Louisiana today.\u201d Justices will also decide whether to take up an Indiana law passed in 2016 that requires a woman to have an ultrasound and be offered the option of viewing the image and hearing the heartbeat at least 18 hours before an abortion. Critics \u2013 including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood \u2013 note that while the state had already required an ultrasound before abortion (which usually occurred the day of the procedure) the new 18-hour requirement would substantially burden some women because they\u2019d have to travel not once, but twice, to far away health centers that have the necessary equipment. Lower courts blocked the law soon after it went into effect. \u201cThe requirement that women have the ultrasound eighteen hours prior to the abortion places a large barrier to access without any evidence that it serves the intended goal of persuading women to carry a pregnancy to term,\u201d wrote a panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. \u201cInstead, it appears that its only effect is to place barriers between a woman who wishes to exercise her right to an abortion and her ability to do so,\u201d the court held. Indiana is appealing that decision to the Supreme Court arguing that its law \u201cmerely combines two pre-existing abortion regulations that are undoubtedly constitutional: an informed-consent waiting period and an ultrasound requirement.\u201d Lawyers for the state say the ultrasound \u201cinforms a woman\u2019s abortion choice and affords her the opportunity to reflect on the information conveyed.\u201d They noted that Planned Parenthood \u201ccould mitigate the burden\u201d by \u201csimply purchasing additional, less expensive ultrasound machines.\u201d Tom Messner, a senior fellow in legal policy the Charlotte Lozier Institute \u2013 a think tank that opposes abortion, said that his group supports ultrasound laws partly because \u201cthat\u2019s how people get their information today \u2013 pictures.\u201d \u201cThey are very effective to helping people make sure that they make a decision that they\u2019re not going to regret later,\u201d he added. The Court is also being asked by the ACLU to take up a Kentucky law that requires a doctor, while performing an ultrasound before an abortion, to describe the procedure, display the ultrasound image and make the fetal heart tones audible to a patient. The law was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but the court put its ruling on hold pending appeal. The court\u2019s majority held that because the law \u201crequires the disclosure of truthful, non-misleading, and relevant information about an abortion,\u201d it does not violate a doctor\u2019s free speech right under the First Amendment. The ACLU is leading a challenge to the law, saying that it \u201ctransforms\u201d standard medical practice into a \u201cpure speech mandate.\u201d They say the law requires doctors to display a \u201cgraphic description of the ultrasound image (including identifying all visible internal organs) during the ultrasound procedure.\u201d And the physician is required to convey the images and sounds to the patient \u201ceven if she tries to physically resist them.\u201d At their closed-door conference, the justices will also consider an abortion-related challenge brought by four individuals and two organizations who engage in \u201csidewalk counseling\u201d with women entering abortion clinics in Chicago. The petitioners have brought a First Amendment challenge to a regulation that bars a speaker from approaching within 8 feet of another for the purposes of \u201cpassing a leaflet or handbill\u201d or \u201cengaging in oral protest, education, or counseling.\u201d The so called \u201cbubble zone\u201d ordinance applies within 50 feet of the entrance of an abortion clinic or medical facility. The city of Chicago argues the restriction is \u201cconstitutional\u201d and \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d to regulate the manner and place of speech, not its content.",

Phil Scott on Thursday said he supports an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, making him the first GOP governor to do so and marking a notable departure from the largely party-line Republican response to a mounting Ukraine controversy. \u201cI support getting the facts in that inquiry that\u2019s happening today,\u201d Scott told CNN affiliate WCAX. \u201cSo I think this is, these are serious allegations we need to \u2013 we need to make sure that we do the fact finding and figure out what exactly did happen.\u201d While governors play no official role in an impeachment process, Scott\u2019s support for an inquiry joins a surging number of House Democrats who have come out in support for the politically divisive escalation in recent days as scrutiny over Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine has grown. The controversy centers around a whistleblower complaint \u2013 which was released publicly earlier Thursday \u2013 that alleges Trump abused his official powers \u201cto solicit interference\u201d from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. A rough transcript of a July phone conversation released by the White House on Wednesday shows Trump repeatedly pushed Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Even before the whistleblower complaint was made available to lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday declared Trump had betrayed his oath of office and announced Tuesday she was opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. Republicans on Capitol Hill have largely offered defense for the President as the Ukraine entanglement has drawn more scrutiny. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina tweeted Wednesday \u201cWow. Impeachment over this? What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger. Democrats have lost their minds when it comes to President.\u201d Here's what Republican senators are saying about the whistleblower complaint Some GOP lawmakers, however, have raised concerns about Trump\u2019s actions. After viewing the whistleblowers complaint Wednesday, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska said, \u201cthere\u2019s obviously some very troubling things here.\u201d Scott has previously broken rank with the Republican party in his role as governor. In July, Scott allowed a comprehensive abortion rights bill to become law and in April 2018, he signed into law sweeping gun control measures for the state.",

And I\u2019m hoping that both the public and press understand the way Trump plays the game,\u201d Clinton said. When asked if she gets upset that Trump continues to say she should be \u201clocked up,\u201d a notion that is often chanted at his rallies, Clinton said, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t kill me because he knows he\u2019s an illegitimate President.\u201d \u201cYou know, Jane, it was like applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd so I know that he knows, that this wasn\u2019t on the level. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll ever know what happened.\u201d On Wednesday, Clinton said Trump \u201cbetrayed\u201d the United States following the release of a transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said she supported an impeachment inquiry into the President. According to a transcript of the conversation released by the White House, Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, during a July 25 phone call. At an appearance Thursday night with the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) in Washington, DC, Clinton said Trump \u201chas betrayed his oath of office to uphold the Constitution and protect and defend our country.\u201d \u201cBut I think it is fair to say we have known who Donald Trump is for some time now. We knew he was a corrupt businessman who cheated people,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe knew that his campaign invited foreign adversaries to tamper with our elections and now we know that in the course of his duties as our President he\u2019s endangered us all by putting his personal and political interests ahead of the interests of the America people.\u201d Clinton also noted the twist of irony that she worked on former President Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment hearings in the 1970s. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more at stake because it\u2019s not just what we now know happened in a phone call between this President and his counterpart in Ukraine. We are living through a crisis in our democracy,\u201d she said. CNN\u2019s Jamie Ehrlich contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that he is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race, ending a campaign that failed to gain traction amid a crowded Democratic primary field. De Blasio sought to cast himself as the most progressive candidate in the large field of Democrats vying to take on President Donald Trump, and he used his time on the national stage to attack less progressive candidates, namely former Vice President Joe Biden, for positions that he felt were out of step with the current mood of the Democratic Party. In the end, however, de Blasio was unable to convince liberal Democrats that he was more qualified than Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the two leading liberals in the 2020 race. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve contributed all I can to this primary election and it\u2019s clearly not my time,\u201d de Blasio said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I\u2019m going to keep speaking up for working people and for a Democratic Party that stands for working people.\u201d De Blasio, 58, pledged on Friday to push for progressive ideas as the Democratic primary process continues. Here are the 19 Democrats who are running for president \u201cWhoever our nominee is, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re speaking to the hearts of working people and they know we\u2019re on their side. And if we do that, we\u2019re going to win. If we don\u2019t, this is an election that could go the other way,\u201d he said. Unlike some of his opponents, de Blasio had been aggressive in attacking candidates who he felt were not going far enough with their presidential runs. \u201cJoe Biden told wealthy donors that nothing will fundamentally change if he were president,\u201d he said at CNN\u2019s July debate in Detroit. \u201c(California Sen.) Kamala Harris said she\u2019s not trying to restructure society, Well, I am.\u201d De Blasio targeted Biden, the Democratic front-runner, multiple times during his run. After it was initially revealed that Biden did not support the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which outlaws federal funds being used for abortion with the exception of rape, incest and the life of the mother at risk, de Blasio pounced and tweeted, \u201cif you don\u2019t support repeal, you shouldn\u2019t be the Democratic nominee.\u201d De Blasio hoped his national recognition as the progressive mayor of the nation\u2019s largest city would help him stand out amid the two dozen Democrats hoping to take on Trump next year. But he failed to resonate in the polls and was criticized for neglecting his duties as mayor to run for president, most notably during a brief blackout in Manhattan in July which happened when he was campaigning in Iowa. De Blasio was pestered throughout the campaign with questions about why he was running in the first place. A Quinnipiac poll released shortly before he announced his run in May found 76% of New Yorkers did not think he should enter the race, contributing to questions from voters and the city\u2019s unrelenting press corps. Trump mocked de Blasio shortly after he dropped out, tweeting that New York City is \u201cdevastated\u201d that their mayor \u2013 who had a meager 33% favorable rating among city voters in a recent Siena College poll \u2013 was returning home. The New York mayor\u2019s decision to drop out now is an acknowledgment that he was not going to qualify for the October debate. After failing to qualify for the September debate, the mayor said that he likely wouldn\u2019t stay in the race if he was unable to qualify for October\u2019s contest. \u201cI think the logical thing to say is, you know, I\u2019m going to go and try to get into the October debates,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cAnd if I can, I think that\u2019s a good reason to keep going forward and if I can\u2019t, I think it\u2019s really tough to conceive of continuing. So that\u2019s the way I\u2019m looking at it right now.\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with President Donald Trump while he was in the nation\u2019s capital. The face-to-face meeting came as Zuckerberg sat down with some of his harshest critics during his visit to Washington. Trump has been among those critics, having repeatedly criticized Facebook as \u201canti-Trump\u201d and for perceived anti-conservative bias. The President has tweeted on multiple occasions in support of conservative activists who have either been kicked off of Facebook or had run-ins with the company. Axios first reported the Zuckerberg-Trump meeting. Trump confirmed the meeting in a tweet Thursday evening. \u201cNice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today,\u201d the President said. The meeting was the most important meeting of Zuckerberg\u2019s rare visit to the nation\u2019s capital this week to meet with some of his biggest skeptics, seeking to bridge a divide between the social media giant and policymakers who have grown increasingly suspicious of its dominance. Zuckerberg will meet members of the House Judiciary Committee on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter, following a slew of meetings on Thursday with some of his most prominent critics in Congress. Zuckerberg is expected to meet with committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, as well as Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline, who leads the committee\u2019s antitrust panel. The Washington Post was first to report on the meeting. Cicilline is several months into a sweeping antitrust probe of tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Last week, Cicilline sent letters to all four companies seeking detailed records on their business practices, acquisitions and prior dealings with governments around the world. It was the billionaire entrepreneur\u2019s first reported trip to Washington since an appearance before Congress in April 2018, when Zuckerberg testified on Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal. Zuckerberg met Thursday afternoon with Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, one of Facebook\u2019s most vocal critics, to discuss data privacy and allegations of anti-conservative bias. Calling it a \u201cfrank discussion,\u201d Hawley said he pressed Zuckerberg to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram. \u201cSafe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions,\u201d Hawley said. He added that Zuckerberg conceded that the company had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in a fact-checking controversy surrounding a pair of videos published by the anti-abortion group Live Action. Zuckerberg left the meeting wordlessly, flanked by advisers including Facebook\u2019s US public policy chief, Kevin Martin. Over dinner Wednesday night, Zuckerberg and a number of US senators discussed Facebook\u2019s role in securing the country\u2019s elections, as well as consumer privacy and competition issues in the social media marketplace. \u201cI was glad for the opportunity to discuss my concerns directly with Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \u201cI focused on the challenges of privacy safeguards and I welcome the strong, constructive interest shown by Mr. Zuckerberg.\u201d The meal at Ris, a fancy bistro in Washington\u2019s West End neighborhood, was arranged at Facebook\u2019s request by Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. In a statement, Warner spokeswoman Rachel Cohen said the dinner also covered \u201cwhat steps Congress should take\u201d to confront election interference and protect consumer data. Warner told CNN that he organized the dinner because he \u201cwanted the Facebook leadership to not just hear from me, but from others.\u201d \u201cThis is not just a tech issue. It\u2019s about civil society, and the integrity of our political debate,\u201d Warner said he told Zuckerberg. As for how Zuckerberg received all this mealtime criticism, Warner said, \u201cHe was responsive. It was a give and take.\u201d Warner added that Zuckerberg agreed that self-regulation will not be enough to protect consumers. \u201cI think he realizes that the longer we delay setting national rules, we raise the bar,\u201d Warner said of Zuckerberg. In visiting Washington personally, Zuckerberg underscores the gravity of the moment for Facebook as lawmakers and regulators continue to bear down on the tech industry\u2019s biggest players. Zuckerberg has said he welcomes additional regulation, because certain key decisions about internet policy should not be left for a small circle of private companies to decide. The company this week released the charter for an oversight board aimed at holding Facebook more accountable to users in its content decisions. And it has launched a civil rights task force to monitor for election and census interference. The company declined to comment. It was not immediately clear which other lawmakers were at the dinner. But prior to the meal, Zuckerberg met with Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee. The two met for a one-on-one, 30-minute session in her office to discuss data privacy and election interference, said a Cantwell aide. Cantwell is one of a small handful of senators working to craft a national privacy law that would cover tech giants like Facebook and Google. But efforts to produce a bipartisan compromise with Commerce Committee Chairman and Republican Sen. Roger Wicker have largely stalled after the group of lawmakers missed several self-imposed deadlines this year to produce legislation. Zuckerberg\u2019s schedule also had him meeting with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee, who chairs the Senate\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, according to the lawmakers\u2019 aides. Zuckerberg and Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz had also sought to meet this week, an aide to the senator said, but their schedules did not line up. The two men met last month, however, in Schatz\u2019s Honolulu office, the aide added. Zuckerberg\u2019s visit to Washington comes as the Federal Trade Commission has ramped up an antitrust investigation of his company. Whether Zuckerberg\u2019s schedule included meetings with regulators or White House officials is unclear, however.  A person familiar with the FTC\u2019s inner workings said they were not aware of any planned visits by Zuckerberg to the commission, but did not rule out the possibility. The Justice Department declined to comment on whether Zuckerberg had plans to meet with antitrust officials at DOJ. A spokesman for the House antitrust subcommittee\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Cicilline\u2019s panel is conducting a top-to-bottom review of the tech industry. Last week, congressional investigators sent sweeping requests for information to Facebook, along with Amazon, Apple and Google.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Tuesday threw her support behind a progressive primary challenger to Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, a lawmaker who is considered to be one of the most conservative House Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez called Marie Newman, who is challenging the congressman in 2020 after unsuccessfully challenging him in the 2018 midterm primary, \u201ca grassroots fighter for working families\u201d in a statement on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a bigger, stronger Democratic Party - one that\u2019s returned to our FDR roots & fights for working people - to change our future in 2020,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, adding, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford deep blue seats fighting against healthcare & equal rights. We need @Marie4Congress.\u201d An endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, who has quickly established herself as a progressive icon currently in her first term in Congress and has a massive following on social media, could give a boost to any candidate. The New York Democrat also recently endorsed Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts in his 2020 re-election bid. Lipinski is viewed by many liberal Democrats as out of step with his party. He voted against the Affordable Care Act, is one of the only congressional Democrats to identify as anti-abortion rights and did not endorse then-President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election bid in 2012. Newman, in contrast, is running on a progressive platform, including supporting the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. She is backed by Justice Democrats, the progressive organization that supported Ocasio-Cortez when she ran a successful primary challenge to veteran House Democratic lawmaker Joe Crowley. In a statement, Lipinski said, \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of Marie Newman makes crystal clear that Ms. Newman is an extreme candidate who is completely out of step with the voters of Illinois\u2019 Third District who do not want to be represented by a fifth member of the \u2018Squad,\u2019\u201d a reference to Ocasio-Cortez as well as progressive Democratic Reps.

Newman said in a statement of her own that she is \u201cthrilled to receive the endorsement,\u201d saying that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201cunwavering dedication to fighting for social, climate and economic justice is a true inspiration.\u201d Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, said in a statement, \u201cWe are so proud that Marie Newman is the first Justice Democrat of this cycle to receive an endorsement from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\u201d The New York Times was first to report the endorsement. Newman has also received high-profile endorsements from other prominent progressives, including Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump and Democratic White House hopefuls have plunged into a new battle over Justice Brett Kavanaugh because they have strong incentives to put the Supreme Court at the epicenter of the election. A number of 2020 candidates demanded Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment after the New York Times published excerpts of a new book containing details about sexual misconduct allegations that he has previously denied, but that revived the raw emotions spurred by his fight for confirmation last year. \u201cBrett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people,\u201d California Sen. Kamala Harris wrote Sunday morning on Twitter. \u201cHe was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.\u201d The Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden, stopped short Sunday evening of calling for impeachment but raised concerns about the integrity of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process. Trump barged into the fray in Kavanaugh\u2019s defense, relishing the opening to revive one of the most emotional and GOP-unifying chapters of his presidency. \u201cBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable,\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday morning. The eagerness of both sides to engage reflects the confrontation\u2019s potential to fire up base activists and an understanding that the fate of the Supreme Court has rarely been more important to the outcome of political and culture wars following signature decisions on the 2000 election, campaign finance, same sex marriage, abortion and health care. The reports are reviving the pitched political exchanges that threatened Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, most notably over allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her when he was drunk at a party when both were teenagers. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the claims. Two Times reporters who wrote the book said they corroborated a prior claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. They also concluded the FBI interviewed none of the potential witnesses, throwing new scrutiny on White House officials and Republicans who strong armed his confirmation last year. The book also contains a former male classmate\u2019s new allegation that the authors say was corroborated by two sources. The authors reported the former classmate came forward to the FBI and senators concerning an incident he witnessed and said the FBI did not investigate the claim. The New York Times Sunday evening published an Editor\u2019s Note saying the female victim declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the incident. A person close to Kavanaugh told CNN the accusation isn\u2019t new because, according to the book\u2019s authors, it had been reported to the FBI and some on Capitol Hill. This person said, citing the new book, that some Democratic senators, despite having been told of the allegations before Kavanaugh was confirmed, did not act. CNN is not reporting any details related to the allegation because it has not independently verified it. A Supreme Court spokeswoman said Kavanaugh had no comment on the new allegation against the justice or the calls for impeachment. Far from playing down the fresh controversy to allow Kavanaugh to quietly repair his reputation and embark quietly on his lifetime appointment to the Court, Trump escalated it. The President must supercharge GOP turnout to win in 2020, so is happy to exploit the latest Kavanaugh controversy to remind his base of one of his key achievements, the installation of a conservative majority on the Supreme Court against fierce liberal opposition. The clash plays into his desire to frame Democrats as entrapped by radicals who want to march the country left and who he claims are smearing the reputation of an innocent man in their desperation to thwart conservative goals. Trump also is keen to position himself as a bulwark against Democratic hopes of reshaping the Court in order to appeal to crucial evangelical voters. \u201cCan\u2019t let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?), false allegations, and lies. \u201cThis is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaugh\u201d Trump tweeted. Can\u2019t let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?), false allegations, and lies. This is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaugh A new skirmish over a potent base politics issue comes at an ideal moment for Trump, whose approval rating has recently dipped below 40% \u2014 a danger sign ahead of a reelection bid. Trump demanded that his Justice Department \u201crescue\u201d Kavanaugh, and advised the judge to sue over the book. He also accused Democrats of trying to influence the rulings of the newest justice, an ironic comment given his own relentless habit of publicly attacking judges and complaining about their verdicts. His remark about the Justice Department also calls to mind previous occasions when the President has appeared to seek to leverage its power to counter political opponents. Trump\u2019s foes were already up in arms over the department\u2019s role in the Kavanaugh drama after it emerged Friday that Attorney General William Barr plans to confer a distinguished service award on the department team that worked on the nomination. Reflecting the unifying nature of Supreme Court controversies, Mitch McConnell also came to Kavanaugh\u2019s defense on Sunday. The Senate Majority leader\u2019s expert and controversial handling of nominations to the top bench has done more than any other single factor to enshrine a conservative majority. \u201cThe far left\u2019s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year\u2019s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate,\u201d the Kentucky Republican wrote on Twitter. \u201cFortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was especially inflammatory because it took place against a backdrop of the #MeToo movement that fundamentally altered the attention society paid to decades of sexual harassment allegations made by women in show business, politics, journalism, the media and the corporate world. Combined with anger over the defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump \u2014 which he has denied \u2014 the Kavanaugh saga electrified the liberal base but also a wider cohort of women voters who will be pivotal in 2020. While Republicans have used the Supreme Court as a campaign trail rallying cry for years, Democrats have been slower to exploit what has become a pivotal societal question. But the aggressive response to the new Kavanaugh allegations demonstrates that the left is now just as motivated by the Supreme Court as conservative voters. As the New York Times report broke Saturday night, Democratic candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro tweeted that it was clearer than ever that Kavanaugh \u201clied under oath. He should be impeached.\u201d The former Housing and Urban Development Secretary called on Congress to review the \u201cfailure\u201d of the Justice Department to properly investigate allegations against Kavanaugh. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Texas Rep Beto O\u2019Rourke and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg all called for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. Later Sunday, Harris urged supporters to sign a petition calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. Warren complained that Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was pushed through the Senate without a full investigation of allegations against him. \u201cConfirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached,\u201d she tweeted. Biden did not call for impeachment but said in a statement that the New York Times story raised \u201cprofoundly troubling questions about the integrity of the confirmation process that put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court in the first place.\u201d And the former vice president, who has been criticized in this campaign for his handling in 1991 as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman of confirmation hearings in which Anita Hill raised sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas, said women who raise allegations against powerful men need to be heard. \u201cIt takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward, under the bright lights of millions of people watching, and relive a traumatic memory,\u201d he said. In practice, there is a minuscule chance that Kavanaugh would be convicted of any impeachment charges brought by the Democratic House, given the need for a two-thirds majority in the Republican-held Senate.",

            "article_content": "In a tweet on Monday, President Donald Trump made a sensational allegation about Google. \u201cWow, Report Just Out! Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election! This was put out by a Clinton supporter, not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought! @JudicialWatch,\u201d Trump wrote. He was referring to a study by psychologist Robert Epstein, which was discussed on Fox Business earlier on Monday. But Trump did not describe the research correctly. And the research itself has been called into question. Facts First: Epstein himself says Trump was wrong about his findings. Epstein did find \u201cbias\u201d in Google search results, but he says there is no evidence Google \u201cmanipulated\u201d the results to favor Clinton. Also, critics of the study note that there is no definitive link between search results and voting behavior in presidential elections. First let\u2019s address what Epstein says Trump got wrong. Then we\u2019ll delve into Epstein\u2019s research. Epstein, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July, found what he alleges was a pro-Clinton bias in Google\u2019s search results. In an interview with CNN on Monday, Epstein said the pro-Clinton bias was \u201csufficient to have shifted between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes\u201d to Clinton. There is no basis in Epstein\u2019s research for Trump\u2019s claim that the alleged bias might have affected \u201c16 million\u201d votes. Epstein did testify in July that big tech companies in general could potentially shift \u201cupwards of 15 million votes\u201d in the 2020 election, but he didn\u2019t claim that this happened in 2016. In the Monday interview, Epstein rejected Trump\u2019s claim that Google \u201cmanipulated\u201d votes in 2016. He said he does not have firm evidence even that Google intentionally manipulated its search algorithm or results, let alone votes themselves. \u201cI don\u2019t have any evidence that Google manipulated anything. I just have evidence that there was this bias \u2013 highly statistically significantly bias,\u201d he said. Google said Epstein was incorrect in his claims of bias. \u201cThis researcher\u2019s inaccurate claim has been debunked since it was made in 2016. As we stated then, we have never re-ranked or altered search results to manipulate political sentiment. Our goal is to always provide people with access to high quality, relevant information for their queries, without regard to political viewpoint,\u201d the company said in an email. (An aside: Judicial Watch, a conservative legal activist group that is active on elections issues, was not involved in Epstein\u2019s research. The group told CNN that it believed Trump tagged it in the tweet to encourage it to look into the allegations.) Epstein is senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and a former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine. He said he voted for Clinton and is not a Trump supporter today. Fact check: Former Michigan congressman sheds light on Trump's claim to be Michigan's 'Man of the Year' For this study, he had 95 people from 24 states, including 21 self-described undecided voters, conduct election-related searches using search engines Google, Yahoo and Bing. Then he had another group of Americans, hired through the crowdsourcing website Amazon Mechanical Turk, use a point scale to rate the supposed bias of the articles found on the first page of the search results. An extremely pro-Trump article would get a minus-5, while an extremely pro-Clinton article would get a plus-5. Using this method, he found that Google\u2019s results were reliably more pro-Clinton, in both red states and blue states, than Yahoo or Bing results. Then, using his previous research from elections in other countries about how search results can affect voter intentions, he came to a broad estimate of 2.6 million to 10.4 million votes potentially affected by search bias in the US in 2016. Epstein said he chose to publish his findings on the website Hacker Noon, not in a peer-reviewed journal. Epstein said he is \u201csuspicious\u201d that Google is deliberately biasing its results, given the Democratic leanings of its employees and the allegations of company \u201cwhistleblowers.\u201d But he said it is possible the bias comes from the company simply neglecting to fix an unintentionally flawed algorithm. \u201cI don\u2019t even care about the human element. There\u2019s a system out there running amok,\u201d he said. Other academics have joined Google in criticizing Epstein\u2019s methodology and conclusions. One issue is the quality of news sources. Google says one of its criteria for ranking news results is how authoritative a source is. Using Epstein\u2019s methodology, a search engine whose top results page did not feature an article from a far-right pro-Trump website, such as Breitbart, would be ranked as more biased in favor of Clinton than a search engine that did showcase Breitbart \u2013 even if the first search engine highlighted a deeply informative Washington Post investigation about Trump\u2019s past and the second search engine highlighted Breitbart\u2019s pro-Trump puff piece. Epstein emphasized that he is not a Trump fan. But he argued that Google results should not be treating pro-Trump media as second-class \u201cfor whatever reason, whatever your excuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve certainly met people that say Breitbart is a more reliable news source than the New York Times \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of subjectivity that goes into these kinds of determinations,\u201d he said. Another issue, other academics say, is that Epstein\u2019s study did not establish a link between alleged bias in search results and voter behavior in 2016. Epstein said he came to the conclusion of bias sufficient to affect 2.6 million to 10.4 million votes based on what he has found in studies of national elections outside the US, including the 2010 Australian prime minister election and a 2014 Indian legislative election. In other words: Epstein did not test 2016 American voters to see if their Clinton-or-Trump choice had been changed by search results they got. He extrapolated from his previous studies. In an American presidential election, people tend to know so much about the two leading candidates, and are getting news from so many different sources, that it is not at all clear that search results would affect their preferences the same way they might in other settings where they have less information, said Michael McDonald, a political science professor and elections expert at the University of Florida. McDonald said it is certainly possible that political results from Google and other search engines have been affected by the unintentional biases of the people who wrote their algorithms. But McDonald said Epstein has failed to establish that any such biases have had anywhere near the magnitude of impact on American presidential voting that Epstein suggests. \u201cIt\u2019s just not plausible,\u201d McDonald said. Ramesh Srinivasan, a professor of information studies at University of California, Los Angeles, and author of the forthcoming book \u201cBeyond the Valley,\u201d said Epstein\u2019s analysis did not take into account how much a voter might care about a particular subject. For example, a strongly anti-abortion voter might be more likely to have their vote affected by abortion-related search results than results about another subject. But Epstein\u2019s analysis did not distinguish between voters\u2019 interest levels in different topics. And Srinivasan noted that the study did not take into account how people\u2019s voting preferences might have been affected by other technological platforms, such as Facebook, which he said was \u201cquite clearly gamed by third parties\u201d in 2016. \u201cYou can\u2019t zero in on Google and have Google be your only factor in your analysis to shape one\u2019s voting outcomes,\u201d he said. Srinivasan also said that the political value systems of the people who create search algorithms might affect the results. He said, \u201cRobert and I agree on a lot.\u201d But he said Epstein\u2019s analysis on search results and voting is overly simplistic. CNN\u2019s Brian Fung contributed to this article.",

            "article_content": "GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa questioned on Wednesday whether there would be any population left on Earth if not for rape and incest, a remark that has drawn condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans. \u201cWhat if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled those people out that were products of rape and incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?\u201d he said in Urbandale, Iowa, according to video posted online by the Des Moines Register, which was first to report on the remarks Wednesday. \u201cConsidering all the wars and all the rape and pillage that has taken place \u2026 I know I can\u2019t certify that I was not a part of a product of that,\u201d King said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that every one of the lives of us are as precious as any other life,\u201d he added. The remarks came as King was defending not allowing exceptions for abortion in cases of rape or incest. The Iowa Republican is a controversial and polarizing figure on Capitol Hill who has a track record of making racist comments that have generated backlash across the political spectrum. In January, House Republicans stripped King of committee assignments, an action that took place after an interview in which he appeared to lament that the term \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d is considered offensive. CNN has reached out to King\u2019s office for comment, but did not immediately receive a response. The remarks quickly generated condemnation from lawmakers in both parties. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican, said in a tweet that the remarks were \u201cappalling and bizarre\u201d and called on him to resign. \u201cToday\u2019s comments by @RepSteveKingIA are appalling and bizarre. As I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s time for him to go. The people of Iowa\u2019s 4th congressional district deserve better,\u201d Cheney tweeted. JD Scholten, who announced earlier this month that he will once again try to unseat King by running against him in 2020, said the Iowa Republican is pushing a \u201cselfish agenda,\u201d and accused him of excusing violence. \u201cOur congressman continues to push his selfish agenda above the needs of #IA04 \u2013 this time he excuses violence. This isn\u2019t what we stand for,\u201d the Democratic challenger wrote, including a link to a fundraising page with the message. Scholten said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Thursday that King\u2019s words \u201care just abhorrent and they don\u2019t reflect the values of this district.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just another of a long line of his controversial statements that ultimately hurt this district, and it\u2019s getting really tiresome,\u201d Scholten said, adding, \u201cAs Iowans, we don\u2019t believe in this extremism that King represents and it\u2019s so divisive.\u201d King also faces a GOP primary before he gets to the general election. One of primary challengers, Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra, called the comments \u201cbizarre\u201d in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cI am 100% pro-life but Congressman King\u2019s bizarre comments and behavior diminish our message and damage our cause,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to hand the 4th District to Nancy Pelosi and her allies in Congress. President Trump needs defenders in Congress, not distractions.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates were quick to denounce the congressman too, with New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand calling for his resignation. \u201cYou are a disgrace. Resign,\u201d Gillibrand tweeted at King on Wednesday. \u201cMy friend @JDScholten is standing up and fighting back against Steve King, and he needs all of our help,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke tweeted, \u201cbecause no matter where you live, you know there\u2019s no place for Steve King\u2019s racism, bigotry, and hatred in Congress. \u201cIowans have long deserved better than Steve King and his hateful, insulting words. He should resign,\u201d tweeted Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. In an exchange with CNN on Tuesday prior to the latest controversial remarks, King argued that he believes he will be re-assigned to congressional committees before 2020. When asked if he hopes to be re-assigned to committees if he is reelected in 2020, King responded, \u201cI\u2019m not going to wait that long.\u201d Referring to the House GOP leader, King said, \u201cKevin McCarthy made a huge mistake, it is an obscene injustice, and it\u2019s an affront to Iowans and everybody in this country.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

            "article_content": "South Carolina Republican Mark Sanford already has one supporter in Congress for his potential long-shot bid to challenge President Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary: newly independent Michigan Rep. Justin Amash. Amash, who left the Republican Party in early July and has repeatedly declined to rule out a presidential bid of his own, told CNN that Sanford \u201cwould be a great candidate.\u201d \u201cI know Mark. He\u2019s thoughtful, he\u2019s humble, he\u2019s learned from his mistakes and grown, and I think we really need a person like that in the White House,\u201d Amash said. \u201cMy perspective is that the party is lost for quite a while and that this party system is corrosive, and I don\u2019t think it can be redeemed anytime soon,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to have voices out there. And the more voices you have, the more likely a miracle could happen.\u201d Amash again brushed off questions about his own presidential ambitions, saying he was focused on providing independent representation for his constituents in Congress. He did rule out the possibility of running in the GOP primary as Sanford\u2019s running mate. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved in the Republican primary in that way,\u201d Amash told CNN. A Sanford run would be quixotic. Once a rising star in the party, he resigned as chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2009 amid a scandal over his infidelity \u2013 including his infamous claim that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail while he was in fact in Argentina with his mistress. He was subsequently elected to Congress, where he\u2019d served before becoming governor, but lost his primary in 2018. If he runs, Sanford would face a Republican Party increasingly unified behind Trump. An overwhelming 90% of Republicans approve of the President, according to Gallup polling last month. But Sanford could present an alternative for a subset of conservatives who are uncomfortable with supporting Trump and have sought a standard bearer in the 2020 race. In 2016, Trump faced pushback from conservative Republicans loosely aligned under the umbrella of \u201cNever Trump\u201d all the way into the general election. But the likelihood of strong resistance to his nomination from within in 2020 has dwindled as the Republican Party has become thoroughly Trump\u2019s party. Republicans in Congress who previously harbored strong doubts about Trump have only become more allied with the President over the past two years, and some of his fiercest GOP critics have left the national stage. Reluctance to publicly split with Trump is increasingly a primary motivation among elected Republicans. This week, after Trump told progressive House freshmen women of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to their own countries in a series of racist tweets \u2014 despite the fact that the four lawmakers in question are all American citizens and only one of them was born abroad \u2014 Republicans have been reluctant to publicly push back on the President, with only four House Republicans voting on Tuesday to condemn Trump\u2019s remarks. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who ran as the vice presidential candidate on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016, is already running against Trump in the GOP primary, but he has failed to gain traction. Sanford\u2019s conservative credentials on issues like abortion and government spending could appeal to religious anti-Trump voters who haven\u2019t been energized by Weld\u2019s moderate record on social issues. In the long run, a Sanford primary challenge, even if it fails as expected, may build a base of supporters who could ultimately rally behind a third-party candidate in the general election \u2013 potentially Amash, now that he\u2019s left the Republican Party. Amash said that he hadn\u2019t spoken with Sanford in recent weeks and didn\u2019t know in advance that his former colleague was considering a presidential bid. Sanford announced on Tuesday that he will consider launching a campaign over the next 30 days, focusing on government spending and the national debt. His potential candidacy was first reported by the Post and Courier. \u201cThere is little to no \u2014 I guess I\u2019d say no discussion of debt, deficit, and government spending in Washington these days,\u201d Sanford said on CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve watched two Democratic presidential debates, and there\u2019s been zero discussion on both of them as to this issue,\u201d he added. \u201cThe President has said we\u2019re not going to touch the very things that touch debt and spending. So I think we\u2019re walking our way into one heck of a financial storm, and there\u2019s no discussion.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the position Sanford resigned from. It was chairman of the Republican Governors Association.",

            "article_content": "Justice John Paul Stevens, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by Republican President Gerald Ford in 1975 in the wake of Watergate and stepped down almost 35 years later as a leader for the liberal side of the bench, has died. He was 99. Stevens, known as a soft spoken midwesterner with a searing intellect, died on Tuesday of complications following a stroke he suffered on July 15, according to a statement from the Supreme Court. He passed away peacefully at Holy Cross Hospital in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, with his daughters by his side, the court said. Stevens was born in the South Side of Chicago in 1920 and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1941, and Northwestern Law School in 1947. In interviews, he shied away from questions concerning his legacy and always maintained that his ideology hadn\u2019t shifted during his years on the court. READ: Supreme Court announces retired Justice John Paul Stevens dies at 99 On the bench, always with his trademark bow tie peaking over his judicial robes, Stevens would often wait until the latter half of an argument, lean forward with a polite, \u201cMay I ask\u201d and then launch a razor sharp question cutting to the core of an advocate\u2019s case. He retired in 2010 at 90 years old, clearing the way for President Barack Obama to nominate Justice Elena Kagan, then 50, to take his place. \u201cThanks to Elena,\u201d he said in a speech in 2015 at the University of Miami Law Review Symposium, \u201cI have never regretted my decision to retire.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts remembered Stevens on Tuesday as a public servant whose \u201cunrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation.\u201d \u201cA son of the Midwest heartland and a veteran of World War II, Justice Stevens devoted his long life to public service, including 35 years on the Supreme Court,\u201d Roberts said in the statement from the court. \u201cHe brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom, and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation. We extend our deepest condolences to his children Elizabeth and Susan, and to his extended family.\u201d Stevens, a craftsman for language, wrote powerful dissents when his views did not carry the day. In Citizens United v. FEC, a campaign finance case in which the majority held that the government could not ban political spending by corporations in candidate elections, Stevens did not mince his words. He accused the majority of rejecting the \u201ccommon sense of the American people.\u201d After his retirement, he said the case should be overruled. \u201cNo doubt about it,\u201d he told an audience in 2015. He also penned a dissent in Bush v. Gore, the controversial 2000 decision that halted a recount of Florida ballots and cleared the way for George W. Bush to take the presidency. \u201cAlthough we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year\u2019s Presidential election,\u201d Stevens wrote, \u201cthe identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation\u2019s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\u201d In a case concerning detainees at Guantanamo Bay in 2004, Stevens wrote the majority opinion holding that detainees could challenge their detainment in federal court. Over his career, he voted to reaffirm the core holding of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion nationwide in 1973; voted in favor of an admissions policy at the University of Michigan Law School that took race into consideration; and he assigned an early gay rights opinion to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who, in turn, relied upon an earlier opinion by Stevens. He served as a naval intelligence officer in World War II, and wrote a strong dissent in a 1989 decision that upheld a protestor\u2019s right to burn the American flag. Although he voted to uphold the death penalty in 1976, near the end of his tenure in 2008 he said he had come to believe that the death penalty represented \u201cthe pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purpose.\u201d Because of his seniority, by 1994, Stevens had the authority to assign opinions when the chief justice was voting on the other side. Stevens, who also happened to be an accomplished bridge player, was a master tactician. He used his assigning authority strategically, sometimes taking on the big decisions himself, other times assigning them to a justice who might be wavering to bolster his or her vote. No slacker in retirement, Stevens wrote books and essays while also appearing often in public for talks and speeches. In March 2017, after a massive school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Stevens took the step of calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment. In an op-ed for The New York Times he noted that he had been in dissent in a 2008 landmark opinion holding for the first time that an individual has a right to bear arms in the home and said the best way to overturn that decision was to repeal the Second Amendment. \u201cOverturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the N.R.A.\u2019s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option,\u201d Stevens wrote. In a 2007 interview with scholar Jeffrey Rosen for The New York Times Magazine, Stevens said that he considered himself a judicial conservative \u201cwho submerges his or her own views of sound policy to respect those decisions by the people who have authority to make them.\u201d Earlier this year in an interview with CNN\u2019s John Berman, Stevens said he hoped President Donald Trump would not damage the nation\u2019s courts \u201ctoo much.\u201d But asked if he believed that Trump understood the role of the judiciary, Stevens responded flatly, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI think he often speaks about them as Obama judges and other kinds of judges,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut I think (Chief Justice) John Roberts was dead right when he said that there are only one kind of judges and they\u2019re all working for the federal government.\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s second quarter fundraising was massive: The presidential candidate raised $19.1 million in a three-month period, a stark contrast from the first quarter of the year when she raised just over $6 million. The details in the report Warren\u2019s campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission late Monday offer something of a roadmap of where Warren\u2019s cash came from, how she spent the money and what might have helped drive the senator\u2019s fundraising success. Her total haul is particularly noteworthy given that the Massachusetts Democrat has declined to hold any high-dollar fundraisers or solicit wealthy donors this year. She outraised \u2013 by about $1 million \u2013 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the other candidate in the 2020 field who is currently pursuing a grassroots-only fundraising strategy. The most recent quarter showed that Warren\u2019s bet on a small-dollar fundraising strategy is working for now, allowing her to compete with some of her rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who have aggressively courted wealthy donors. 5 takeaways from 2020 Democrats' second quarter fundraising reports The clues below only offer a snapshot of Warren\u2019s fundraising because the FEC only requires campaigns to itemize contributions larger than $200. The Warren campaign itemized about $6.4 million of the more than $19 million raised in the second quarter because the great bulk of the donations she pulled in \u2013 more than $12 million \u2013 came in amounts of $200 or less. Still, the spikes in itemized donations may tell us when and why her smaller-dollar donations surged. Warren made waves in April when she came out as the first major Democratic presidential candidate to call for impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, after the release of a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia report. While the announcement drew praise from pro-impeachment voters, the move was also seen as politically risky. Warren\u2019s FEC report shows that it resulted in a spike in fundraising. Consider that in the week leading up to that Friday in April, Warren raised an average of around $24,000 per day (again, this is only taking into account the itemized donations that are greater than $200 \u2013 a fraction of Warren\u2019s total fundraising and therefore an incomplete picture). On the Friday that Warren called for impeachment proceedings, she raised almost $94,000 in a single day from donations greater than $200. The next day, she pulled in more than $105,000. The following are some other strong fundraising days for Warren, and our best guess as to what could have contributed to the cash influx on those days (another reminder that the following daily hauls only represent donations that were more than $200): Overall, Warren had her strongest fundraising stretch of the quarter in the final week ahead of the second quarter deadline. Warren spent $2.6 million on staff salaries alone in the second quarter \u2013 a sizable chunk of the $10.6 million she spent over those three months. That\u2019s almost as much as what Julian Castro raised in the entire quarter and doesn\u2019t even account for the additional $1.2 million in payroll taxes. Her campaign previously told CNN that they now have more than 300 campaign staff, with some 60% of them in the four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Warren has one of the biggest payrolls among all the candidates in the giant Democratic field \u2013 both a sign of her early robust organizing, but also a reminder of how costly paying those staffers will continue to be. In the first six months of the year, Warren\u2019s campaign also spent more than $2.9 million on Facebook and Google ads. In photos: Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren As in past presidential elections, Hollywood celebrities are opening up their wallets for the Democratic candidates who hope to take on President Donald Trump next year. These are some of the A-listers in the entertainment industry who gave to Warren in the second quarter: Heading into the summer months \u2013 often a period of slower political fundraising \u2013 Warren has some $19.8 million cash on hand. That war chest is only rivaled by the $27 million Sanders has in his coffers, and Buttigieg\u2019s $22.7 million cash on hand. For both Warren and Sanders, the money they were able to transfer over from existing accounts has proven to be hugely helpful: Warren transferred over more than $10 million from her Senate campaign account in the first quarter, while Sanders transferred over around $6 million from previous campaign accounts in the second quarter.

            "article_content": "The red-state drive to ban or severely limit access to abortion this year has sparked the opposite reaction in Democratic-led states, where lawmakers are cementing abortion rights and making it more accessible. Driving the moves on both sides is the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court, which is fanning fears on the left that the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal in the US could be gutted or overturned altogether. Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont are leading the charge to enshrine abortion rights at the state level. Last week, Illinois became the third state to ensure abortion remains legal even if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, following Vermont days earlier and New York at the beginning of the year. What Supreme Court justices talk about when they talk about reversing milestone cases These come as Alabama and others have gone the other way by passing laws that effectively ban the procedure. \u201cWe weren\u2019t seeing bills moving for months until so many abortion bans got passed that blue states started to feel the pressure,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit advocacy group that supports abortion rights. All the activity has brought abortion to the forefront of the 2020 presidential election, with several Democratic candidates \u2013 including Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2013 promising to defend Roe. Twenty have said that they will participate in a Planned Parenthood Action Fund forum on Saturday in South Carolina. The rising wave of abortion restrictions in America President Donald Trump is also seizing on state moves on abortion, doubling down on his pro-life stance during his campaign kickoff speech on Tuesday. He cited a failed attempt to loosen late-term abortion rules in Virginia earlier this year. \u201cTrump is making it a core of his campaign,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, spokeswoman for the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List. \u201cHe will use what\u2019s happened at the state level to motivate and mobilize voters.\u201d The highest-profile change in state abortion laws took place in Alabama last month, which adopted the nation\u2019s most restrictive rules so far. Doctors who perform abortions face criminal charges with life sentences, and the law doesn\u2019t make exceptions in cases of rape and incest. The ultra-conservative stance even drew objections from some prominent pro-life Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who said it went too far. Louisiana and Missouri soon followed with bans on abortion after six weeks and eight weeks, respectively. Those brought the total number of bans \u2013 including multiple \u201cheartbeat\u201d bills, which would ban the procedure if a fetal heartbeat is detected \u2013 in 2019 to 26 across 12 states, according to Guttmacher. Much of this activity is designed to generate legal challenges that will reach the US Supreme Court. Conservatives now dominate the court with the Trump appointments of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cMany Americans, myself included, disagreed when Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973,\u201d said Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, in a statement when she signed her state\u2019s bill into law. \u201cThe sponsors of this bill believe that it is time, once again, for the US Supreme Court to revisit this important matter, and they believe this act may bring about the best opportunity for this to occur.\u201d All these moves prompted some Democratic-led states to strengthen their protections. In addition to enshrining the right to have an abortion, Illinois also requires health insurers to cover the procedure and expands the number of providers by allowing certain nurses and physician assistants to perform abortions. \u201cThe Reproductive Health Act ensures that women\u2019s rights in Illinois do not hinge on the fate of Roe v. Wade, or the whims of an increasingly conservative Supreme Court. In this state, women will always have the right to reproductive health care.\u201d said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat. In all, abortion would remain legal in 13 states if Roe v. Wade falls. Many other states took action in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the last time abortion rights were under threat in the Supreme Court, Nash said. Nevada, meanwhile, repealed the state\u2019s criminal abortion law, while Maine broadened its pool of medical professionals who could perform abortions and required insurers and Medicaid to cover the procedure. Many state legislatures have wrapped up their 2019 sessions, but Nash and Quigley expect the divide to widen even more next year. More states will likely pass restrictions, while others will seek to strengthen abortion rights. \u201cUntil people feel the threat, they don\u2019t take action,\u201d Nash said.",

            "article_content": "Soothsayers were out in force at the Supreme Court on Monday, scrutinizing each move by the justices and hoping to better understand the future of the Roberts court, with its newly solidified conservative majority. Twenty opinions linger on the docket, as well as a request from the Justice Department asking the court to consider the termination of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protects young immigrants from deportation. Those decisions will all likely occur by the end of the month, the self-imposed deadline the justices set before they scatter for the summer. On Monday, the justices sent out a few clues of what\u2019s coming next. The court dealt a victory to \u201cSweetcakes by Melissa\u201d \u2013 a bakery in Oregon that refused to make a cake to celebrate the wedding of a same-sex couple out of religious concerns. For months, the justices discussed the case behind closed doors, and the final action resembled a compromise meant to appease dueling sides. To be sure, it\u2019s a win for Melissa and Aaron Klein, the bakers, as it wipes away a lower court opinion that went against them. The state Bureau of Labor had issued a $135,000 penalty against the couple for compensatory damages for emotional, mental and physical suffering. But the justices did not agree to hear the case next term. Instead, without comment, they asked the lower court to reconsider the case in light of the court\u2019s ruling last term in favor of a baker in Colorado. That ruling was based on comments made by a commissioner of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Supreme Court sides with Oregon bakery that refused to make cake for same-sex wedding Last year, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the commissioner had not dealt with the issue with the \u201creligious neutrality\u201d that the Constitution requires. But Kennedy also warned, writing just before his retirement, that the outcome of cases \u201clike this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts.\u201d Lawyers for the Kleins hoped, with the addition of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that that day had arrived. In their briefs, they swung for the rafters, asking the justices to take up the case, overturn precedent  and render an opinion rooted in the First Amendment that would have a broad national impact. An opinion like that would have come down in the heat of the next election. Now, it may not. There are other similar cases close behind, including one by a florist with similar concerns who declined to make a floral arrangement for a same-sex couple. But for now, the issue is off the table at the high court and it\u2019s likely the justices won\u2019t rule on such a case next term. As for LGBT rights supporters, they were hoping the court would simply deny the Kleins\u2019 petition outright. \u201cIt is a long-standing legal rule that the freedom of religion is not a license for businesses to discriminate,\u201d said Jennifer C. Pizer, a lawyer from Lambda Legal. She said she was \u201cconfident\u201d that the Oregon court will ultimately find that \u201cthis discrimination case has been handled fairly and justly.\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas was happy to side with six of his colleagues in an opinion that upheld decades-old precedent. The court said an individual can be charged and tried in state and federal court for the same conduct without running afoul of the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for a 7-2 majority, pointed out that the court had long abided by the so-called \u201cdual-sovereignty doctrine,\u201d which holds that a crime under one sovereign\u2019s laws is \u201cnot the same\u201d offense under the laws of another sovereign. The decision wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise. At oral arguments, Justice Elena Kagan noted that the challenger in the case was asking justices to do something they try to avoid: overturn precedent. \u201cYou know,\u201d Kagan said, referring to the dual-sovereignty doctrine, \u201cthis is a 170-year-old rule, and it\u2019s a 170-year-old rule that\u2019s been relied on by\u201d justices over the course of history. Supreme Court says person can be charged and tried in state and federal court for same conduct In signing on with the majority, however, Thomas took the opportunity to make clear there are times when it does make sense to overturn precedent. \u201cA demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power,\u201d Thomas wrote. No other justice signed on to the opinion, but Thomas\u2019 sentiments might not be welcomed in liberal circles fearful that the court is poised to take a hard right turn with a newly solidified conservative majority in areas such as abortion and affirmative action. Not all 5-4 opinions break down along familiar ideological lines. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, wrote an opinion dismissing a challenge to a lower court opinion that struck down several Virginia state district maps that had been crafted by the Republican-led House of Delegates. She was joined by Justices Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, Neil Gorsuch and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg said the House \u201chas not identified any legal basis for its claimed authority to litigate on the State\u2019s behalf.\u201d The court\u2019s action means that court-drawn maps that favor Democrats would continue to be used in the state. Supreme Court hands Democrats a win in Virginia racial gerrymander case Chief Justice John Roberts is about to show his cards In dismissing the case, Ginsburg wrote that the Republican-led legislature could not \u201ccontinue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process\u201d in part because they hadn\u2019t shown the necessary concrete injury to come before the court. \u201cReally?\u201d wrote Justice Samuel Alito. \u201cIt seems obvious that any group consisting of members who must work together to achieve the group\u2019s aims has a keen interest in the identity of its members.\u201d \u201cThe invalidation of the House\u2019s redistricting plan and its replacement with a court-ordered map would cause the House to suffer a concrete injury,\u201d wrote Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Brett Kavanaugh. Ginsburg read the opinion from the bench in a hoarse voice that a court spokeswoman said was due to a cold and laryngitis. On the mend from surgery to remove cancerous nodules in December, Ginsburg shows no signs of slowing down. Last month she made a quick trip to Sweden to receive an award. In a speech last week in New York, she warned that some of the remaining opinions might split down ideological lines and seemed to lament Kennedy\u2019s retirement, which she said was the \u201cgreatest consequence\u201d of this term. Justice #RuthBaderGinsburg leaving What The Constitution Means To Me on B\u2019way! The show was great. #RBG pic.twitter.com/KBhl5All0W Over the weekend she was spotted leaving a Broadway show, \u201cWhat the Constitution Means to Me,\u201d where audience members applauded her attendance as she made her way to her awaiting car. Although the court won\u2019t allow cameras in the courtroom, and she\u2019s nearly lost her voice, she is making her presence felt. And in the next two weeks that could be critical. The court has yet to decide two politically charged cases, one concerning the Trump administration\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census and another tackling extreme partisan gerrymanders. In addition, it has signaled that it\u2019s ready to act on a petition from the government concerning DACA and potentially add that case to the docket next term.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden described himself in 2006 as an \u201codd man out\u201d within his own party on the issue of abortion, saying he made all sides angry with his approach. Biden made the comments ahead of his 2008 presidential bid in a March 2006 interview with Texas Monthly. Video was later posted on YouTube in 2008 and reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile. The interview highlights how Biden has long staked out a more middle-ground approach on abortion rights compared to many in the Democratic Party. Biden\u2019s views on abortion rights faced scrutiny last week from advocacy groups and his Democratic rivals when his campaign announced he still supported the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal government funds from being used to pay for abortion except in cases of rape or incest and to save the life of the mother. Amid the criticism, Biden then quickly reversed his long-held position but said it was Republican attacks on Roe v. Wade \u2013 not political pressure \u2013 that led him to change course. What is the Hyde Amendment and why did Joe Biden once support it? In the 2006 video, Biden called himself the \u201codd man out\u201d in the Democratic Party on the issue because of his votes to limit government funding for abortion and votes in support of bans on certain late-term abortions. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit of an odd man out in my party,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI do not vote for funding for abortion. I voted against partial birth abortion \u2013 to limit it \u2013 and I vote for no restrictions on a woman\u2019s right to be able to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade. And, so I am \u2013 I made everybody angry. I made the right-to-life people angry because I won\u2019t support a constitutional amendment or limitations on a woman\u2019s right to exercise her constitutional right as defined by Roe v. Wade.  And I\u2019ve made the groups \u2013 the women\u2019s groups and others \u2013 very angry because I won\u2019t support public funding and I won\u2019t support partial birth abortion.\u201d Biden also said he would have difficulty navigating the issue in a Democratic presidential field. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it\u2019s always a tragedy, and I think that it should be rare and safe, and I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions. There ought to be able to have a common ground and consensus as to do that.\u201d \u201cI think the vast majority of the American people think that can be done. But unfortunately, we\u2019re put in the position, you\u2019re either, \u2018eliminate abortions under all circumstance\u2019 or quote \u2018abortion on demand,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, I\u2019ve never known of a woman having an abortion say \u2018By the way, I feel like having an abortion.\u2019 It\u2019s always a tragic decision made. Always a difficult decision. And I think we should focus on how to deal with women not wanting abortion.\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates did not directly address the former vice president\u2019s 2006 comments when reached for comment, but said Biden supports abortion rights. \u201cVice President Biden supports a woman\u2019s right to choose and he believes that we are in a moment of unprecedented assault on choice in this country,\u201d Bates said. \u201cAs president, he would fight to preserve Roe v. Wade and he has called for it to be codified into law,\u201d Bates said. \u201cVice President Biden would nominate judges who would stand firm on upholding all of our constitutional rights, including a woman\u2019s right to choose. If you look at his record on Supreme Court nominees you will see who he\u2019s fought for \u2014 Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 and who he\u2019s fought against \u2014  Robert Bork, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, and Samuel Alito.\u201d Biden said on Tuesday that he did not change his position on the Hyde Amendment out of political expediency, but instead was concerned about low-income women\u2019s access to abortion services. \u201cThe truth is, the majority of the American people agree with the Hyde Amendment, OK?\u201d Biden said in an interview with Iowa\u2019s WHO-TV. \u201cSo the idea that this would be helpful to change is not accurate in terms of being able to win an election.\u201d Biden\u2019s position on abortion rights has put him at odds with liberal groups and some members of his party over the years, with pro-abortion rights groups opposing his stand against government funding of abortion. Anti-abortion groups have also attacked Biden for his opposition to limiting access to abortions.",

            "article_content": "Neither President Donald Trump nor his front-running Democratic foil could seem to believe it. \u201cHe said my name so many times that people couldn\u2019t stand it anymore,\u201d Trump exclaimed at an ethanol plant in Council Bluffs, Iowa, referring to his latest b\u00eate noire, former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cApparently he had my speech on Air Force One,\u201d Biden said around the same time, 250 miles away in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. \u201cI guess he is really fascinated with me. I find it fascinating.\u201d It was a political version of the putdown favored by passive-aggressive teenagers everywhere \u2013 why are you so obsessed with me? \u2013 rendered by two septuagenarians eager to occupy the other\u2019s head. In the end, it was Biden who singled out Trump more often by name \u2013 35 times, according to CNN\u2019s count \u2013 compared to 15 mentions of Biden by the President. Trump and Biden swap blows ahead of long-distance face-off in Iowa Perhaps ceding to advisers who have warned against elevating the Democratic front-runner, or maybe hoping to dispel the notion that Biden is causing him electoral anxiety, Trump avoided any mention of his rival during an evening speech to a fundraiser in Des Moines. Still, for both men \u2013 who brushed against each other in Iowa Tuesday but never crossed paths \u2013 the reasons for obsession are plenty and obvious. Trump has singled out Biden as the most formidable threat to the blue-collar voters who propelled him to the White House in 2016 \u2013 and polls (both public and internal) have shown Trump lagging behind the former vice president in states that were central to his victory. He\u2019s also threatening the iron grip Trump once held on the news cycle. Cable networks all carried some or all of Biden\u2019s midday speech in Iowa, a fact that did not go unnoticed aboard Air Force One as the President was jetting to the state. That\u2019s on top of Trump\u2019s lingering fixation with his predecessor, President Barack Obama, and the link to that administration Biden represents. Biden, meanwhile, has framed his entire campaign on the grave necessity of defeating the President. Unlike some of his Democratic rivals \u2013 who were left on the sidelines Tuesday as the center-ring candidates sparred \u2013 Biden has decided to focus squarely on Trump, even as he talks sanguinely of not being drawn into a a mudslinging match. A preoccupation with the incumbent has lent his campaign a general election sensibility, all in keeping with the image of a front-runner he\u2019s eager to maintain. Joe Biden heads to Iowa as frontrunner status is tested With those motivations in mind, each tore into the other on Tuesday. On their first day trading attacks in an early voting state, a picture emerged of a potential general election match-up colored by personal insults, open hostility \u2013 and attacks striking in their similarity. Over the course of three events in the eastern part of the state, Biden deemed the President an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the country, questioning his intelligence on matters of policy and casting him as clueless to the struggles of working Americans. \u201cI don\u2019t think the President really gets the basics,\u201d Biden said during an evening speech in Davenport, which was so heavy on Trump insults that his campaign sought to program the whole day around it, releasing prepared text of the entire thing at 6 o\u2019clock in the morning. Lampooning Trump\u2019s onetime declaration that \u201cI alone can fix\u201d the country\u2019s problems, Biden scoffed: \u201cFix yourself first, Donald Trump.\u201d He decided to nix a line from the prepared text declaring cashiers at Target \u201cknow more about economics than Trump.\u201d The President, too, went after Biden\u2019s smarts, albeit in far cruder terms. \u201cJoe Biden is a dummy,\u201d he declared on the White House South Lawn before departing for Iowa, adding later: \u201cHe looks different than he used to, he acts different than he used to, he\u2019s even slower than he used to be. So I don\u2019t know.\u201d Trump, of course, is no stranger to allegations of mental decline; he was so eager to disprove claims of senility that he asked his doctor to administer a mental acuity test and release the results publicly in 2017. Like many of Trump\u2019s insults, the accusation didn\u2019t come with many specifics. Donald Trump (and Fox News) are dog-whistling on Joe Biden Asked about the allegations later in the day, Biden was not inclined to shrug them off. Instead, he turned the insult into a contest of lucidity. \u201cLook at him and look at me and answer the question,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s self-evident, you know it\u2019s a ridiculous assertion on his part.\u201d \u201cAll I can say is watch me,\u201d he said. \u201cJust watch me.\u201d For Biden, questions about his mental state at least provided a distraction from more acute questions about his political decisions. His jousting with Trump overshadowed any lingering Democratic criticism of his shifting stance on whether federal dollars should be used to pay for abortion. And after receiving flak from rivals for not appearing in Iowa over the weekend, Biden largely had the state to himself on Tuesday, aside from the Republican incumbent. With Democrats largely quiet in their criticism of the front-runner \u2013 and with his own strategy against Biden still coming into focus \u2013 Trump sought to fill the void using material dating to his last campaign. \u201cHe makes his stance in Iowa once every two weeks and then he mentions my name 74 times in one speech,\u201d he said during his event at the ethanol facility, which was ostensibly a taxpayer-funded official engagement, but nonetheless included several political jabs. \u201cThat reminds me of Crooked Hillary,\u201d he added. \u201cShe did the same thing. And then, when it came time to vote, they all said, \u2018You know, she doesn\u2019t like Trump very much, but what else does she stand for?\u2019 The same thing is happening with Sleepy Joe.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden said Tuesday that he had not reversed his long-held position in favor of a measure that bans federal funds from being used for most abortions as a matter of political expediency. RELATED: What is the Hyde Amendment and why did Joe Biden once support it? The former vice president suggested his new stance would be unpopular in a general election. Democrats broadly oppose the Hyde Amendment. Biden had long favored it, but he reversed his position last week after two days of criticism from his Democratic rivals for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination. When asked in an interview with WHO-TV\u2019s Dave Price on Tuesday in Ottumwa, whether his shifting view was based on a political calculation, Biden replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate criticism for them to look at.\u201d Top 2020 Democrats best Trump in hypothetical matchups in new poll \u201cThe truth is, the majority of the American people agree with the Hyde Amendment, OK?\u201d Biden said. \u201cSo the idea that this would be helpful to change is not accurate in terms of being able to win an election.\u201d Biden campaigned in Iowa on Tuesday, where he was interrupted several times by anti-abortion protesters. He told reporters he would still back the Hyde Amendment if women of all incomes could access abortions. But as largely Republican-led states implement strict new restrictions on abortion rights \u2013 potentially setting the Supreme Court up to reconsider Roe v. Wade \u2013 he said he had changed his position because that access does not currently exist. He said that as he developed his campaign\u2019s health care plan, which would funnel more people into government-funded and subsidized plans, poorer women would be left without health insurance that covered abortions \u2013 making it untenable to keep the federal ban in place. \u201cHow do you say no? You can\u2019t use \u2013 there would be no way for a poor woman to be able to exercise her constitutional right, and that\u2019s what the decision was, because I was finalizing that plan, we laid it out and that was the decision I made,\u201d Biden said. He cited \u201cthe all-out attack across the board on Roe v. Wade, the elimination of almost any exception that was available\u201d in some Southern states where Republicans this year have enacted strict abortion laws. Read: Joe Biden's remarks as prepared for delivery in Iowa When a reporter asked why that was more clear at the end of last week, when Biden changed his mind, than it was at the beginning, when he still wanted to keep the Hyde Amendment in place, he responded: \u201cYeah, don\u2019t be a wise guy with me.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t consult with anybody but me in that decision because I was sitting on the way down finalizing the plan, and what hit me was we\u2019re in a situation where when the assault was going on in Georgia, what\u2019s going on in Alabama, Missouri, it\u2019s just outrageous,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd, look, I made a commitment that I would not ever attempt to impose my religious views on anyone else in terms of how it relates to this most unique question in all of humanity: When does the human life begin? When does that occur?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019m not going to do that, and conversely I find myself in a position, how do you say to now the women who are in poverty that increasingly have no access to women\u2019s health care? How do you say, \u2018Well, guess what, it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone\u2019? So that\u2019s the reason why I made that decision.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden took their feud to the same state on Tuesday, holding dueling events in Iowa after spending weeks jabbing each other from a distance. Biden, the 2020 Democratic candidate who has most consumed Trump, kicked off a three-stop swing by labeling Trump an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the country. It was just one of a series of blistering attacks the Biden campaign had previewed on Tuesday morning, and before even landing in the Hawkeye State, Trump began counter punching. \u201cHis whole campaign is to hit Trump. When a man has to mention my name 76 times in a speech, that means he\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Trump said, before knocking Biden as a \u201cdummy\u201d and \u201cweak mentally.\u201d Trump\u2019s retort delivered exactly the kind of general election framing Biden has sought to elicit as he looks to solidify his front-runner status in a crowded Democratic primary. And despite repeated warnings from his advisers not to give Biden oxygen, Trump has continued to take the bait. Joe Biden heads to Iowa as frontrunner status is tested Trump will hold his first stop of the campaign season in Iowa Tuesday while Biden bashes him elsewhere in the state, but the President and former vice president won\u2019t come within 100 miles of each other while in the Iowa Tuesday. Instead, the two will essentially draw an invisible line down the middle of it. Biden will spend his day campaigning in eastern Iowa, according to his schedule, while Trump will head for the western side to make remarks on renewable energy before flying to central Des Moines for a dinner and fundraiser with the state\u2019s Republican Party. White House officials insisted the twin visits to the state were not planned, but campaign aides said they found the optics humorous. Though they won\u2019t come face-to-face, the feud that has bubbled up between Trump and Biden broke into public view as they prepared to share time in the state. On Tuesday morning, Biden\u2019s campaign released his prepared remarks for later in the day, previewing a slew of blistering attacks on the incumbent he hopes to replace. And as Trump departed the White House, he fired a salvo of his own. \u201cHis whole campaign is to hit Trump. When a man has to mention my name 76 times in a speech, that means he\u2019s in trouble,\u201d the President said, before suggesting that Biden \u2013 who at 76 is about four years older than Trump \u2013 has gotten \u201cslower.\u201d Trump, who has previously attacked Biden\u2019s intelligence, also called Biden \u201ca dummy\u201d and \u201cthe weakest mentally\u201d among the field of 2020 Democratic candidates. \u201cI think he\u2019s the weakest mentally,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I like running against people that are weak mentally.\u201d Trump\u2019s allies were delighted in recent days as the Biden campaign dealt with several missteps. Biden was hit with blistering criticism from his 2020 rivals over his position on an amendment regarding abortion rights, before reversing days later. His campaign moved quickly to amend their climate change plan after aides admitted several policy statements were missing attribution. And he skipped the largest gathering of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to date while attending his granddaughter\u2019s graduation, a move that did not go unnoticed by his competitors. But Biden will be in Iowa on Tuesday when Trump comes to town \u2013 setting him up for the visual he has desired from the start: a direct competitor to the President. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know Joe Biden was back from his hiatus,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, told CNN in a statement. \u201cHas Alyssa Milano been consulted?\u201d The actress and women\u2019s rights activist has been a Biden supporter and reportedly urged him to reverse his stance on the abortion rights amendment. Despite Biden\u2019s stumbles, those close to the President say Biden has occupied his head space more than any other candidate in the Democratic field, because Trump fears Biden poses a more serious threat to the blue-collar appeal that helped him win the 2016 election. Trump has continued to regularly phone aides and allies in the early morning hours to quiz them about Biden \u2013 and ask whether he poses a threat to his staying power in the White House. Trump lashed out in recent weeks after an internal campaign poll showed him lagging behind Biden in states that will be crucial to his re-election victory, such as Michigan, and even told some he doubted the numbers. With his speech on Tuesday, Biden looked to damage Trump\u2019s support in those states and his image as a champion of working-class Americans, casting Trump\u2019s tariffs as harmful to farmers and manufacturing workers. \u201cIowa farmers have been crushed by his tariff war with China and no one knows better than the folks in Iowa. He thinks that being tough is great, well it\u2019s really easy to be tough when someone else absorbs the pain: farmers, manufacturers, the automobile industry,\u201d Biden said. CNN Iowa Poll: Nearly 8 in 10 likely caucusgoers want some candidates to drop out For Trump, Iowa is among the collection of prized states that he turned from blue to red during his race for the White House. He carried Iowa\u2019s six electoral votes, defeating Hillary Clinton 52% to 42%, a staggering turnaround after Barack Obama twice won the state. In Iowa, 32 counties flipped between the last two presidential elections, where voters chose Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016. It was more than any other state in the country. Trump\u2019s visit on Tuesday serves as something of counter-programming for a state crowded with Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 nearly two dozen of whom have been campaigning for the Iowa caucuses early next year. Trump, who has complained that Democrats are being treated more fairly by the press than he was, is intent on keeping the state in the Republican column in 2020. Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who served in the Obama administration as agriculture secretary, said Democrats underestimated Trump at their own peril. \u201cI think it would be foolish for anyone to assume that a sitting president is easily defeated,\u201d Vilsack told CNN. \u201cI think we need to understand this is going to be a very, very difficult fight.\u201d Barely a day goes by where one Democratic presidential candidate \u2013 or several \u2013 aren\u2019t visiting the state at any given time. Trump has become a frequent punch line, but Democratic leaders here have warned their supporters against thinking the President will be easy to unseat. \u201cYou just can\u2019t bash him,\u201d said J.D. Schouten, one of the most sought-after Democratic leaders in Iowa who narrowly lost a congressional bid last year to Rep. Steve King, the outspoken conservative firebrand. \u201cDemocrats have to be for something.\u201d Trump returns from Japan with eye on 2020 While some aides have advised the President to refrain from attacking Biden by name, suggesting he \u201csit back and enjoy the show,\u201d others say Trump enjoys having a foil, no matter how far away the general election is. He has attacked Biden from the South Lawn of the White House, while standing next to the Japanese prime minister during a news conference in Tokyo and often from his favorite platform, Twitter. And Biden, who is hoping to set himself apart from the fray of the expansive 2020 field, has happily returned the fire. While in Davenport, Iowa, Tuesday, Biden will go after Trump by name dozens of times while labeling him \u201can existential threat to America.\u201d \u201cIn 2020, we not only have to repudiate Donald Trump\u2019s policies and values \u2013 we have to clearly and firmly reject his view of the Presidency,\u201d Biden will say, according to prepared remarks released by his campaign. As the President grows more consumed with cable news coverage of his potential election foes, his campaign has focused on ways to distract from Democrats during their upcoming campaign rallies and election debates, aides told CNN. But the President\u2019s re-election effort has noted he\u2019s not the only candidate on the ticket in 2020. His fundraiser Tuesday will benefit the Iowa Republican Party, not his campaign, an aide said. Tickets for the dinner started at $250 for general admission, with higher prices for a dinner with the president. Trump spent a significant amount of time in Iowa during the 2016 presidential campaign. After he famously descended the Trump Tower escalator and declared he was running for president nearly four years ago, Trump boarded his 757 jet and headed straight for Des Moines, where he gave a wide-ranging speech and attendees received free \u201cTRUMP: Make America Great Again\u201d t-shirts. He ultimately lost the Iowa caucuses to Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump but affirmed his support in the state when he beat Clinton in the general election. But two House seats in Iowa flipped from Republican to Democrat in the 2018 midterm elections, a sign of the state\u2019s continuing shifting demographics.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden returns to Iowa this week, where his status as the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination will be tested as he navigates rising criticism from his rivals and a series of self-inflicted wounds that have raised questions about his strength as a candidate. Since entering the race in April, Biden has consistently topped national polls and has campaigned as a front-runner \u2013 keeping his focus on President Donald Trump while maintaining a noticeably lighter travel schedule than most of his opponents. Aside from early interviews with ABC News and The View, Biden has also largely avoided national media appearances. But some warning signs for Biden have emerged in recent days. After Biden\u2019s campaign last week reiterated his long-held support for a ban on federal funds being used for abortion, the rest of the Democratic presidential field roundly criticized him. Biden then quickly reversed his position, attributing the evolution to growing Republican attacks on abortion rights. The former vice president\u2019s campaign also added citations to his plan to combat climate change after facing criticism for lifting some of its language from liberal groups. And a new Iowa Poll from CNN and the Des Moines Register showed he still tops the Democratic field, but with a smaller margin than in most national surveys. The poll also showed an enthusiasm gap for supporters of Biden and those of his top competitors. CNN Iowa Poll: Biden leads a tighter top tier in first caucus state The burden is now on Biden, who returns to Iowa to campaign on Tuesday and Wednesday, to show that he can hold onto his front-runner position. Veteran Democratic officials and operatives in Iowa say Biden is still playing catch-up to several rival campaigns in establishing an organization in the state. Biden will be competing Tuesday in Iowa for headlines with Trump, who will visit the state to tout his administration\u2019s lifting the restrictions on higher ethanol blends and for a fundraiser for the state GOP. In a speech on trade Tuesday, Biden will attack on Trump\u2019s trade policies, saying he hopes the President\u2019s presence in Iowa will be a \u201cclarifying event.\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s farmers have been crushed by his tariff war with China,\u201d Biden will say according to his prepared remarks. \u201cNo one knows that better than Iowa.\u201d Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who worked closely with Biden while serving as agriculture secretary for all eight years of the Obama administration, said the former vice president is aware of the challenges facing his candidacy and the need to prove himself. \u201cThe challenge for him and for any candidate is to tap into this passion that exists among Democrats,\u201d Vilsack said. \u201cHe\u2019s aware of that. He also has the challenge of making sure the policies and ideas he has are his own and are fresh, new and bold.\u201d The chief argument of Biden\u2019s campaign \u2013 his claim that he\u2019s the strongest candidate to defeat Trump \u2013 will be tested by Iowa voters in the eight months leading up to the caucuses. His advisers know that a poor showing in the state would all but doom his candidacy. To make his electability argument, Biden has been focusing far more on Trump than on his Democratic rivals. He chose Ottumwa as his first stop on Tuesday, which is the largest city in Wapello County, one of 32 that Trump flipped from blue to red in the 2016 election. Iowa had more counties turn from blue to red than any other state in the country. The most frenetic weekend of campaigning in Iowa yet saw 19 candidates visit the state for the Hall of Fame dinner, a gathering of hundreds of Democratic activists and loyalists featuring a circus-like atmosphere on the streets of Cedar Rapids outside the event. Biden was noticeably absent, as he was a week prior with another larger 2020 event in California. While he was attending his granddaughter\u2019s high school graduation, which voters and party activists said was understandable, several wondered aloud why his campaign didn\u2019t so much as hang a banner to show he is not taking the state for granted. On Monday, at an event in Washington, Biden responded to criticism of his absence from the events in Iowa this past weekend by defending his choice to stay home. \u201cOne of my competitors criticized me for not going to Iowa to talk for five minutes. \u2026 My granddaughter was graduating,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt was my daughter\u2019s birthday. I would skip inauguration for that.\u201d And Biden\u2019s rivals used the event \u2013 just as did they at the California Democratic Party\u2019s convention, which Biden also skipped \u2013 to test lines of attack against the former vice president. Buttigieg told attendees at the Iowa Hall of Fame dinner that Democrats will not win in 2020 by \u201cpromising a return to normal.\u201d Sanders offered another implicit criticism of Biden, warning against \u201ca middle ground strategy that antagonizes no one, that stands out to nobody and that changes nothing.\u201d Joellen Megan was on hand for Biden\u2019s first Iowa visit last month to Iowa City. She said he remains among her top candidates \u2013 largely because she believes in his electability argument \u2013 but added that she is far from ready to commit to his campaign. \u201cI want to be open-minded to the younger people who are running, too. They have a lot to offer,\u201d Megan said in a weekend interview, as she watched Democratic candidates at the Hall of Fame Dinner. \u201cJoe has a lot to offer with his experience, too, but young people have experience that also is valid.\u201d Biden\u2019s approach of keeping a limited public campaign schedule and focusing his attacks on Trump, rather than engaging with other Democratic candidates, comes with at least one advantage that will be tough for other candidates to match: More time to raise money. He has embraced the high-dollar donor events that his foes eschewed and is likely to reveal a hefty fundraising haul when 2019\u2019s second quarter closes at the end of June. The stakes will rise later this month, when the Democratic field meets in Miami for its first debate. With a national audience tuned in, Biden can deliver a performance that begins to put questions about his politics and approach to the campaign to rest \u2013 or that guarantees they will hang over his candidacy for what could be a rough summer. But there are already signs Democrats are paying close attention to Biden\u2019s stumbles. At events across the state over the weekend, Democrats were attuned to Biden\u2019s reversal on an abortion issue days earlier. His campaign said Wednesday he supported the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from being used to pay for abortions; after a day and a half of criticism from his opponents and from women\u2019s rights groups, Biden changed course Thursday night and said he would repeal the Hyde Amendment. \u201cHe wanted to keep it in place. That\u2019s really what he believes,\u201d Shana Spier, a 40-year-old claims adjuster in Sioux City, said Saturday while watching a series of Democratic candidates speak at the Des Moines pride festival\u2019s candidate forum. \u201cHe just backed down when it was brought up to him.\u201d Others said they were miffed Biden hasn\u2019t kept a busier campaign schedule as other candidates hold as many as six events per day. \u201cIt bothers me that Biden is taking a vacation,\u201d Jim Ferguson, a retired educator, said while attending a Buttigieg campaign stop on Saturday. Other Democratic candidates largely declined to criticize Biden\u2019s scheduling priorities, but said they\u2019ve benefited from spending time in the early-voting states. \u201cThis is the only way I know to learn what\u2019s most important to the people of Iowa, is to show up and listen to them. And not just the questions that you heard asked publicly, but in-line folks to say, \u2018Hey, you know, on, on your answer about this, have you thought about taking this additional step or a moment to add something to the question that I asked you?\u2019\u201d former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke told reporters Friday. \u201cAnd, and we\u2019re writing down everything everyone tells us. And then incorporating that, as long as I agree with it, into the plans that we\u2019re proposing for the country.\u201d Warren is widely seen as having the strongest Iowa presence, with staffers already holding organizing events without the candidate. California Sen. Kamala Harris and O\u2019Rourke recently announced major expansions of their Iowa operations. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker used the Hall of Fame dinner as a show of force for his organizing push. \u201cI think these next few months are pretty critical for Biden in Iowa,\u201d said J.D. Schouten, one of the most sought-after Democratic leaders in Iowa. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game at this point. If he comes out here and does put in the work, he\u2019ll definitely have success.\u201d CNN\u2019s Daniella Diaz and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Majorities of likely Iowa Democratic caucus participants say any candidate who hopes to win their support must favor a woman\u2019s right to abortion, recognize climate change as humanity\u2019s greatest threat, and support restoration of a ban on assault-style weapons, according to a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll. Other issues, including recent campaign touchstones such as support for Medicare for All, free tuition for public four-year colleges and restoration of felon voting rights are must-haves for less than half of caucusgoers, regardless of whether they plan to participate virtually or in person. RELATED: Poll results | 2020 Election coverage The survey finds almost no significant differences between people who are likely to participate in person and those who will participate virtually when it comes to issue priorities. Support for abortion rights is tops, with about 8 in 10 calling it a must have regardless of how they plan to participate. Recognition of climate change as the greatest threat to humanity stands narrowly behind, a must-have for about three-quarters. Fewer (about 6 in 10) say it\u2019s a must have to support restoring the ban on assault-style weapons. Among in-person caucusgoers, liberals are more apt to call nearly all of the nine issues tested \u201cmust-haves\u201d than are moderates, but the gap is largest on Medicare for All (60% of liberals call it a must-have vs. 39% of moderates) and abortion rights (90% vs. 70%). There is also a wide gap by age on Medicare for All, with those under age 35 about 20 points more likely to prioritize it than their elders. Younger caucusgoers were also more likely to see student debt forgiveness as a must-have (61% among those under age 35 vs. roughly a third of older likely caucus attendees), and while there aren\u2019t sharp differences by age on the importance of recognizing climate change as humanity\u2019s greatest threat, there is a wide gap on support for the Green New Deal (42% among those under age 35 consider it a must-have vs. less than 30% among older likely caucus attendees). Although support for abortion rights tops the list, it also prompts a gender divide in the poll. It is more of a \u201cmust-have\u201d issue for women (85%) than for men (72%). The survey also looked at whether certain traits which divide the historically large field would be advantages or disadvantages for a general election run against President Donald Trump. Just one was named an advantage by majorities of both in-person and virtual likely caucus participants: Having years of experience in Washington. Three of the top four candidates in the race are age 69 or older, yet almost no likely caucus participants say that many years of experience on Earth is an advantage (1% among likely in-person attendees call being over age 70 an advantage against Trump, 3% among virtual). Those who back former Vice President Joe Biden (age 76) are more apt to say it doesn\u2019t make a difference than are other likely caucusgoers. CNN Iowa Poll: Biden leads a tighter top tier in first caucus state Likely caucus participants are divided on whether being a woman helps or hurts against Trump. Among those likely to participate in-person, 23% call it an advantage, 19% a disadvantage and 54% say it makes no difference. But among those likely to participate virtually, a larger 28% see being a woman as a disadvantage and 23% call it an advantage. Likely caucus participants tilt positive on the effects of coming from a place that mostly votes for Democrats and on being white. Three-in-five likely in-person Democratic Iowan caucusgoers say that being gay makes no difference in a candidate\u2019s ability to face Trump in the general election, while a quarter see it as a disadvantage. Among likely virtual attendees, 12% say it\u2019s an advantage, that compares with just 4% among likely in-person attendees. The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, from June 2 through 5 among a random sample of 600 likely Democratic caucus participants reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. The sample included 433 who said they plan to attend the caucuses in-person and 167 who said they plan to attend virtually. Results for the combined sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is 4.7 points for those planning to attend in-person, 7.6 points for those who plan to attend virtually.",

            "article_content": "Three-in-10 Americans say they would only vote for a candidate for major office who shares their views on abortion, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. That\u2019s higher than at any point in CNN polling on the topic from 1996 on. Gender is a big factor in whether a person views abortion as a critical issue, even more than partisanship. Women (33%) \u2013 especially independent women (42%) and non-white women (39%) \u2013 are more apt to consider it a critical issue than men (26%). The share who say it is critical for them is about the same across party lines (33% for independents, 29% for Democrats, 28% for Republicans). Twenty percent overall say they don\u2019t see abortion as a major issue, while 45% would consider a candidate\u2019s position on abortion, but don\u2019t see it as a decisive issue. RELATED: Full poll results After former Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he still supports the Hyde Amendment \u2013 a prohibition on federal funds being used for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at stake \u2013 many of his opponents jumped at the opportunity to draw a distinction with the frontrunner and oppose his take. The poll was conducted before the debate over the Hyde Amendment erupted, and, in its results, Biden\u2019s backers were no different from other potential Democratic primary voters on whether the issue is central to their choice for major offices (30% among Biden\u2019s supporters, 32% among other potential Democratic voters). But abortion has been a prominent issue outside of the Democratic contest as well. Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and other states have enacted laws placing sharp limits on abortion designed to test the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade ruling, which established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. The poll finds most Americans are opposed to bans on abortion. In general, Americans\u2019 views on when abortion ought to be legal have shifted slightly toward the extreme ends of the scale since the last time CNN polled on the topic in 2016. A majority felt it should be legal only under certain circumstances in that poll (53%), but now, 48% feel the same way. At the same time, the shares saying abortion ought to be legal in all circumstances (31%) and illegal in all circumstances (18%) have each ticked up a couple of points. About 4 in 10 whose views on abortion fall at the far ends of the scale say they will only support a candidate who shares their views on abortion (42% among those who say abortion should be illegal in all situations, 37% among those who say it should be legal in all). That drops to 21% among those who think it should only be legal under some circumstances. Asked more directly about a law in their own state banning all abortions except those necessary to save the life of the mother, nearly 6 in 10 Americans (58%) are opposed, 36% would favor it. Majorities of Republicans (53%) and conservatives (57%) would favor such a law, but opposition among Democrats (75%) and liberals (82%) is stronger. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS May 28 through 31 among a random national sample of 1,006 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. It is larger for subgroups.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand wants you to know she isn\u2019t \u201cvery polite.\u201d The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate is seizing on a moment from a Fox News town hall on Sunday when host Chris Wallace chastised the New York Democrat for attacking the right-leaning network\u2019s coverage of abortion. Gillibrand, after a nurse asked her about late term abortions, defended her pro-abortion rights views and, while looking at Wallace directly, accused Fox News of pushing a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d around the issue and saying its coverage was a \u201cproblem.\u201d Wallace responded: \u201cI understand, maybe to make your credentials with the Democratic base who are not appearing on Fox News, you want to attack us, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s frankly very polite.\u201d Women candidates, more than their male counterparts, are often criticized for appearing impolite or not smiling enough. In 2016, then-GOP candidate Donald Trump referred to his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton as a \u201cnasty woman.\u201d The phrase later became a mantra for the Women\u2019s March after Trump\u2019s election. Gillibrand responded to Wallace by saying she will criticize the network \u201cin a polite way,\u201d but argued that \u201cwhat happens on Fox News is relevant\u201d because of its influence, especially on loyal viewers. Democratic candidates have publicly debated whether to go on Fox News, including for town halls hosted by the network. The Democratic National Committee declined to give Fox News a primary debate, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has publicly rejected an invitation to participate in a town hall on Fox News, saying the conservative network is a \u201chate-for-profit racket.\u201d Other candidates have said they would happily take a town hall on the network. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg used his Fox News town hall to attack the network\u2019s primetime lineup. Following the town hall, Gillibrand\u2019s team quickly worked to turn the moment into momentum, which her campaign needs. Since announcing her candidacy earlier this year, Gillibrand has built a serious campaign and rolled out a series of policies but has failed to gain much traction in polls or in fundraising. On Monday morning, the senator tweeted a video of her exchange with Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m never going to stop fighting for women and for our progressive values \u2013 whether or not it\u2019s considered \u201cpolite.\u201d That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president,\u201d she wrote. Also that morning, her campaign changed her Twitter bio to reflect the comment. \u201cMom to Theo, Henry and dog Maple. Wife to Jonathan. U.S. Senator from NY and candidate for president. Not \u2018very polite,\u2019\u201d read the new profile. And, shortly after that, her campaign began selling a tote bag that read, \u201cFrankly, not very polite.\u201d Gillibrand, along with a handful of other presidential candidates, have joined the fight against a string of restrictive new abortion laws in states like Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, among others, hoping to turn the backlash into a rallying cry for Democrats in 2020. These Democrats have accused Trump\u2019s support for the laws as a \u201cwar on women.\u201d The clearest sign of this happened in May, when a string of 2020 candidates took to the steps of the Supreme Court to rally with Planned Parenthood and other progressive groups in opposition to the new laws. \u201cThis is something that President Trump has unleashed,\u201d Gillibrand said during an interview with CNN at the rally. \u201cHe apparently wants to have a war on women in America, and if this is a war that he wants to have, he will have it, and he will lose it, because American women are not going to accept this.\u201d A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to a request for comment on this story.",

            "article_content": "Republicans have been successfully leveraging the Supreme Court balance of power as a major campaign issue to ignite their base since the 1980s. For Democrats, the 2020 election may mark the first in modern times that they unite around the high court as a driving force in a presidential election. Democratic candidates are increasingly advocating \u201ccourt packing,\u201d that is, upping the number of Supreme Court justices to balance the bench \u2013 or ensure a liberal majority. The idea is unlikely to succeed for historical and practical reasons but its resonance on the campaign trail reflects Democrats\u2019 new emphasis on the judiciary during the Trump era. The issue emerges partly from lingering anger over the Republican-led Senate\u2019s 2016 stall of President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland, a fire stoked this week when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said if a Supreme Court vacancy occurred in 2020 election year, he would confirm a Trump nominee. The Point: McConnell's outrageous hypocrisy on a Supreme Court vacancy McConnell\u2019s comments were an audacious reversal of his 2016 election-year position blocking Garland for the vacancy caused by the sudden death that February of Justice Antonin Scalia. McConnell argued that the seat should be filled by whoever won the then-upcoming presidential election. Also drawing Democratic attention to who sits in the nine black leather chairs at the high court has been the recent enactment in states of new abortion bans. The fate of those restrictions would eventually be decided by the Supreme Court, now featuring four liberals and, with Brett Kavanaugh replacing the retired Anthony Kennedy last year, five solid conservatives. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been worried about \u2018Will the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade,\u2019\u201d California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris told a Los Angeles audience earlier this month.  Harris said she was open to adding more justices. \u201cI think it\u2019s a conversation that we need to have. I am open to increasing the numbers on the Supreme Court,\u201d she said, responding to a woman who asked about enlarging the court and prefaced her question with a complaint that McConnell \u201cstole a Supreme Court seat.\u201d \u201cThe most critical issues of our lifetimes, before and in the future,\u201d Harris said, \u201cwill be decided by that United States Supreme Court.\u201d In a similar vein, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the House Democratic Caucus, said Wednesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d \u201cWe think that the Supreme Court issue should be a voting issue in November of 2020.\u201d Jeffries was responding to McConnell\u2019s latest remarks about possibly confirming a third Trump justice to the high court. To be sure, the leading Democratic candidates are not of a single mind on Supreme Court proposals. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for example, has criticized \u201ccourt packing,\u201d warning that it could end up benefitting Republicans, and he instead has touted term limits for justices. Both parties have put the Supreme Court and character of the federal judiciary at the center of today\u2019s politics. President Donald Trump has tweeted that the country needs \u201cmore Republicans \u2026. And must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court,\u201d and, again this month, he disparaged a judge based on his appointment by the Democrat Obama. Of a ruling that an accounting firm had to turn over Trump financial records, the President said, \u201cIt\u2019s totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge.\u201d Less prominent but equally significant, the Trump administration, partnering with McConnell, has been setting records for the number of life-tenured US appeals court judges appointed. That\u2019s the powerful level just below the Supreme Court. Trump has won Senate confirmation for 41 appeals court judges, more than twice the number that Obama saw confirmed by this point in his first term. And the Trump pace could continue. The Republican majority has lifted Senate procedural rules and left Democratic senators with scant opportunity to slow the consideration of nominees they oppose. While these developments elevate the 2020 election-season stakes for the judiciary, they also could come at the cost of judicial independence in the public eye. \u201cThe more you politicize the judiciary,\u201d said New York University law professor Barry Friedman, who has tracked public attitudes toward the Supreme Court, \u201cthe more people will question the institution of judicial review.\u201d Retired Justice John Paul Stevens says he hopes Trump 'won't do too much damage' to the courts Friedman is not surprised by the current Democratic apprehension about the US courts. \u201cIt\u2019s cumulative, and they feel something is slipping away,\u201d he said. \u201cThe President and Senate are also waving through lower court appointments like they\u2019re at the Grand Prix.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts addressed some of the politicization last November, when he responded to another Trump \u201cObama judge\u201d comment and issued a statement scolding the President and implicitly warning people on both sides: \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d Trump has also scoffed at the various Democratic proposals, saying in response to a reporter\u2019s question during a March news conference, \u201cThe only reason that they\u2019re doing that is they want to try to catch up. So if they can\u2019t catch up through the ballot box by winning an election, they want to try doing it in a different way. \u2026 It\u2019ll never happen. It won\u2019t happen. I guarantee it won\u2019t happen for six years.\u201d Hot, but longshot, idea South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was among the first of the Democratic presidential candidates to spotlight court overhaul proposals. He endorsed the possibility of a 15-justice Supreme Court and term limits (rather than life tenure) at a CNN town hall in March. \u201cWhat we need to do is stop the Supreme Court from sliding toward being viewed as a nakedly political institution,\u201d he said at the Austin, Texas, forum. \u201cI\u2019m for us contemplating whatever policy options will allow that to be possible.\u201d By law, Congress can set the number of justices, and it has exercised that power over the decades from a high of 10 justices to a low of five. It has been 150 years since the last change, when Congress established the current nine-member bench. Any term limits on the justices, however, would require a change to the US Constitution, which established life tenure for federal judges. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt tried to persuade Congress to add more justices to the Supreme Court in the 1930s after it invalidated several of his New Deal economic initiatives. Roosevelt proposed the appointment of a new justice for every sitting justice older than 70; six of the nine were then over 70. The idea floundered with the public and Congress. So \u201ccourt packing\u201d would unsettle 150 years of nine justices and recall FDR\u2019s infamous failure. It also seems impractical even for progressive Democrats promoting the idea. To change the size of the Supreme Court under such plans, Democrats would have to win the White House and the Senate in 2020, as well as hold the current majority in the House. It they were to succeed, would the party use its new political capital to restructure the high court, rather than turn to economic, environmental and other policy initiatives that might be more appealing to the electorate? \u201cI would bet no,\u201d says Duke University law professor Neil Siegel, who has worked as a special counsel to Democratic senators during Supreme Court nominations and is currently cautioning liberals against court-packing proposals. Siegel argues that they would invite further politicization of the nation\u2019s courts. Yet, he adds that the momentum behind court-overhaul ideas at campaign venues reflects people\u2019s sense \u201cthat something has gone fundamentally awry \u2026 that the court is substantially more conservative than the country.\u201d Such sentiment is far from bipartisan, of course. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and a group of Republican colleagues have offered a measure for a constitutional amendment that would keep high court at nine. (Any amendment to the Constitution, whether to lock in the number of justices or to institute term limits, would require ratification by three-fourths of the 50 states: 38.) There has been little public polling on these ideas. One survey question, however, conducted by Fox News in April, found that when asked about \u201cincreasing the number of justices on the US Supreme Court,\u201d a majority of registered voters were against the idea. Pollsters found 37% of voters were in favor, 51% opposed and 12% unsure. They also found Democrats were more in favor of increasing the number of seats (51%); only 23% of the Republicans polled said they wanted more justices. The emerging Democratic interest is seen in voters who turn out at candidate forums. At a recent Harris rally at Los Angeles Southwest College, Michele Eason said she had researched scenarios that would allow a future president to add new justices to the Supreme Court. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the FDR solution to the problem we\u2019re talking about \u2013 which was that there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that says the Supreme Court has to have nine members,\u201d Eason said, adding, \u201cNormally I would say, hey that\u2019s kind of dirty pool and it\u2019s not playing fair. Two words: Merrick Garland.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta and Maeve Reston contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday if a Supreme Court vacancy occurs during next year\u2019s presidential election, he would work to confirm a nominee appointed by President Donald Trump. That\u2019s a move that is in sharp contrast to his decision to block President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the high court following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. At the time, he cited the right of the voters in the presidential election to decide whether a Democrat or a Republican would fill that opening, a move that infuriated Democrats. Speaking at a Paducah Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Kentucky, McConnell was asked by an attendee, \u201cShould a Supreme Court justice die next year, what will your position be on filling that spot?\u201d Thomas, Ginsburg draw battle lines for future abortion cases The leader took a long sip of what appeared to be iced tea before announcing with a smile, \u201cOh, we\u2019d fill it,\u201d triggering loud laughter from the audience. RELATED: Thomas, Ginsburg draw battle lines for future abortion cases David Popp, a spokesman for McConnell, said the difference between now and three years ago, when McConnell famously blocked Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s ascension to the Supreme Court, is that at that time the White House was controlled by a Democrat and the Senate by Republicans. This time, both are controlled by the GOP. McConnell\u2019s remarks were viewed by CNN on the website of WPSD TV in Paducah. McConnell hinted at this position during an October appearance on Fox News Sunday when host Chris Wallace pressed the senator on whether he would fill a vacancy should one occur in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ll see whether there\u2019s a vacancy in 2020,\u201d McConnell replied without directly answering what he would do. McConnell has made the confirmation of federal judges a key part of his Senate legacy and a highlight of his stump speech in Kentucky where he is running for a seventh term. At the lunch, he said overhauling the judiciary is the best way to have a \u201clong-lasting positive impact\u201d because \u201ceverything else changes.\u201d McConnell: No lame duck confirmation \u201cI remember during the tax bill, people were agonizing over whether one part of the tax bill was permanent or not. I said, \u2018Look, the only way the tax bill is permanent depends on the next election,\u2019 \u201d McConnell said. \u201cBecause people have different views about taxes in the two parties and they approach it differently when they get in power.\u201d \u201cWhat can\u2019t be undone is a life time appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of the judge is to follow the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing we\u2019ve done in the country, which cannot be undone.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court made clear on Tuesday that it\u2019s not ready to take big strides quickly on abortion and the future of Roe v. Wade. But justices also revealed that the far right and the far left side of the bench are drawing their battle lines, in anticipation of other cases concerning more restrictive laws currently hurtling toward the court. In an unsigned opinion, the justices let stand a lower court opinion that invalidated part of an Indiana law that said the state can ban abortions solely motivated by the race, sex or disability of the fetus. The court did allow a provision requiring clinics to bury or cremate fetal remains to take effect. The move will keep the Indiana law off the docket during an election year and allowed both sides of the debate to take away a partial victory. But it\u2019s clear the court won\u2019t be able to hold off too much longer. The Indiana law is only the first of many the justices will be asked to consider in the weeks and months to come, and state legislatures continue to promote more restrictive abortion access laws. Justice Clarence Thomas warned his colleagues that they will have to deal with some of the issues soon. \u201cThe Constitution itself is silent on abortion,\u201d Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion that also spent 15 pages discussing the history of eugenics. Within 72 hours, abortion may be unavailable in Missouri, advocates warn \u201cEnshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the 20th Century eugenic movement,\u201d Thomas wrote. READ: Supreme Court ruling on Indiana abortion law \u201cThis law and other laws like it promote a State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics,\u201d Thomas wrote, later adding that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was \u201cparticularly open about the fact that birth control could be used for eugenic purposes.\u201d Thomas acknowledged that the Supreme Court might benefit from having that issue percolate more in the courts below, but also wrote in detail why he believes such a law might be necessary and he pointedly said that just because the justices allowed the lower court opinion to stand, it should not be interpreted \u201cas an agreement with the decisions below.\u201d No other justice, including Thomas\u2019s four fellow conservatives who are seen as backing more restrictive access to abortions, joined him, noted Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that Thomas\u2019s opinion is therefore less a prediction of where the court is likely to go than an aspiration,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cAt least for now, the rest of the conservatives don\u2019t seem eager to jump into this sensitive political thicket.\u201d On the left, liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor staked out their ground, saying that they would have blocked the entire Indiana law. Ginsburg suggested that the lower court might have used the wrong standard to review the provision. \u201cThis case implicates the right of a woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the state,\u201d she wrote. In a footnote, Ginsburg referred to the \u201cundue burden\u201d language in the 1992 Casey v. Planned Parenthood case that upheld Roe v. Wade. \u201cA woman who exercises her constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy is not a \u2018mother\u2019; the cost of, and trauma potentially induced by, a post-procedure requirement may well constitute an undue burden,\u201d she wrote. The footnotes also revealed some of the frustrations both sides are feeling. Supreme Court leaves intact block on Indiana abortion restriction, but allows fetal burial to go into effect \u201cJustice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent from this holding makes little sense,\u201d Thomas wrote in one footnote. \u201cJustice Thomas\u2019 footnote \u2026 displays more heat than light,\u201d Ginsburg wrote. By moving gingerly on Tuesday, the court dealt with one law, but it is only the first of many the justices will be asked to consider in the weeks and months to come. For instance, they are already looking at still another Indiana law that requires an ultrasound at least 18 hours before the procedure. That too was struck by the lower courts who emphasized that it would put a particular burden on low-income women unable to make more than one trip to a clinic many miles from their home. In addition the court will consider a Louisiana law that requires doctors to have admitting privileges in local hospitals. On top of that, Republican states emboldened by President Donald Trump are introducing laws that would be a near total ban on abortion. Just last week a federal judge in Mississippi issued a preliminary injunction against a law that would ban abortions once a fetal heart beat is dedicated \u2013 as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Only six months ago the same judge struck a similar state law that banned abortion at 15 weeks. Trump's 'religious conscience' rule for health care providers draws court challenge \u201cHere we go again,\u201d Judge Carlton Reeves of the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi said in blocking the new law. \u201cThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that women have the right to choose an abortion prior to viability.\u201d More than a dozen other states have introduced similar laws based on gestational age.",

Politicians \u2013 they\u2019re just like us! As we all grill out and chow down on ice cream, the Democrats running for president will be doing the same. Literally. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will host three ice cream social events in New Hampshire on Monday. He\u2019ll be joined by a man who knows his way around ice cream: Ben & Jerry\u2019s co-founder Ben Cohen. (Cohen is the one of the four co-chairs of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign.) Cory Booker ends a four-day Memorial Day weekend swing through Iowa \u2013 via RV! \u2013 with a BBQ in Urbandale on Monday. Delicious! He hardly has Iowa to himself, however. At different points in this holiday weekend, his Senate colleagues Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Elizabeth Warren\u00a0(Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) crisscrossed the state. 4. Can Gillibrand make abortion her issue?\u00a0The New York senator has struggled mightily to distinguish herself amid the crowded 2020 field. Which is why she is placing a very big bet that she can seize on a series of restrictive abortion laws passed in states like Georgia, Alabama, Missouri and Ohio by Republican legislatures to spark her candidacy. In Iowa over the weekend, Gillibrand told the crowd at one of her events that \u201ca woman should be able to decide when she\u2019s having children, how many children she\u2019s having and under what circumstances she\u2019s having,\u201d according to Politico. She also traveled to Georgia earlier this month to protest that state\u2019s fetal heartbeat law, casting the abortion fight as central to American democracy. \u201cOne of the tenants of our democracy is that we have a separation of church and state, and under no circumstances are we supposed to be imposing our faith on other people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think this is an example of that effort.\u201d There\u2019s no question the push for more abortion restrictions inflames a good portion of the Democratic base. It\u2019s less clear if Gillibrand can be the candidate to channel that outrage.

Click to subscribe! 3.\u00a0 A majority say they wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump: There\u2019s a number buried in a Quinnipiac University poll that you should keep an eye on as the November 2020 election gets closer. Asked whether they would definitely vote for Trump or definitely not vote for him if he is the Republican presidential nominee in 2020, a majority \u2013 54% said they would definitely not choose the President. Three in 10 (31%) said they would definitely support Trump while 12% said they would \u201cconsider\u201d voting for him. Breaking down that definitely-won\u2019t-vote-for-Trump, uh, vote by party: 94% of Democrats said they will not vote for him while 54% of independents and 10% of Republicans said the same. Obviously that looks like a major warning sign for the sitting President. And it is! You never want a majority of Americans saying they absolutely won\u2019t vote for you. But remember this: The 2020 election will be a choice between Trump and the Democratic nominee. And the President has to hope that he can convince some of those 54% who say that they won\u2019t vote for him that he is the devil they know and, therefore, a safer choice. 2.\u00a0Debate season is a month away: One month from today, the first Democratic debate will commence \u2013 the informal kickoff to the long sprint to the February 3, 2020, Iowa caucuses. The debate will unfold over two nights \u2013 June 26 and 27 \u2013 and could feature as many as 20 of the 23 announced Democratic candidates. (At the moment, 19 of the 23 have qualified for the debates \u2013 either by averaging 1% in three national polls or cresting 65,000 individual donors to their campaign.) Here\u2019s how who gets in which debate will be decided: All candidates polling 2% or higher \u2013 that\u2019s Joe Biden, Sanders, Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Booker, according to the Real Clear Politics average \u2013 will be randomly split between the two nights. Then the same will be done for the candidates at more than 1%. The goal? Make sure there isn\u2019t a JV debate and a varsity debate \u2013 which is what happened for Republicans in 2016. Using this random system, it virtually ensures the biggest names are split relatively evenly between the nights. 1. Biden vs. Trump, already: It\u2019s months before a single vote is cast in the Democratic primary race, but it already feels a bit like the general election is underway thanks to President Trump\u2019s near-constant attacks against Biden. While in Japan over the weekend, Trump singled out Biden, again, for criticism. Tweeteth Trump: \u201cNorth Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that\u2019s sending me a signal?\u201d Trump\u2019s own aides have tried to dissuade him from direct attacks on Biden for fear of elevating the former VP. That mission has clearly failed. The challenge for Democrats not named \u201cBiden\u201d is trying to ensure voters knows they have lots more options out there. Easier said than done with Trump\u2019s fingers on the button (the \u201ctweet\u201d button). This story has been updated to correct the number of events Bernie Sanders will host on Monday.",

            "article_content": "American political parties are running to the extremes on abortion as conservative lawmakers vie to impose stricter limits on terminating pregnancies, prompting Democrats to rally in defense of women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2013 and the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. But the country remains planted somewhere in the middle. The public largely thinks that abortion should be legal, but is extremely divided on how. That\u2019s how it comes to be that a Republican governor in Vermont is allowing an abortion rights bill to become law and a Democratic governor is set to sign one curbing abortion rights in Louisiana. A CBS News poll conducted this month finds more than two-thirds of Americans saying they would like the Supreme Court to keep the Roe ruling in place (67%) while just 28% say they\u2019d like to see the court overturn it. Nearly half of Americans (48%) say they would be dissatisfied or angry if the ruling were overturned, 23% say it wouldn\u2019t matter much and 26% would be happy or satisfied. Although there isn\u2019t much of a gender gap on whether the court should maintain Roe (69% of women and 65% of men say so), women are more apt to say they would be angry if it were overturned (38% vs. 24% among men). Protests erupt across the country over restrictive new abortion bans The poll also finds that 44% of Americans think abortion should be generally available, 34% that it should be available but under stricter limits than it is now and 20% that shouldn\u2019t be permitted at all. About half of Republicans in the CBS poll (48%) think the Supreme Court should keep Roe. Democrats are more aligned. The vast majority (87%) would keep it and only 11% of them think the Supreme Court should overturn it. A Quinnipiac University poll also conducted in May finds 60% of voters think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 35% said it should be illegal in all or most cases. When asked specifically whether it should be legal in instances of rape or incest, 82% say it should be. But while 41% say they support \u201cbanning abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy,\u201d 48% say they oppose such a law, including 51% of women. Almost 6 in 10 in that poll, 57%, say they think it\u2019s unlikely that Roe v. Wade will be overturned within the next few years, while 29% believe that is likely. It\u2019s clear that 2020 is going to be an election largely built around a national divide on the issue and the coming Supreme Court fight, particularly among Democrats as they seek to mobilize female voters against Trump and Republicans try to keep conservatives fired up. That\u2019s why a pack of Democratic presidential candidates joined demonstrations in front of the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts would codify Roe v. Wade into law. They\u2019ve both also proposed ending the Hyde Amendment, language included in US spending bills since 1994 that bans the use of taxpayer funds for abortion except in cases of rape and incest. So have Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. O\u2019Rourke was not at the Supreme Court but rather at a CNN town hall Wednesday night, where he also made a pledge about Supreme Court justices. \u201cAs president, I will make sure that every nominee to every federal bench, including the Supreme Court, understands and believes that the 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade, is the settled law of the land,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. That could be a meaningless test, however, because Republican nominees to the court have also said they would respect the precedent of Roe, although it is the appointment of conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh that made overturning Roe seem possible. \u201cAs a judge, it is an important precedent of the Supreme Court,\u201d Kavanaugh said during his confirmation hearing. \u201cI said that it\u2019s settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court.\u201d We\u2019ll see how that works out, whether conservatives who were counting on Kavanaugh to undermine Roe get their way \u2013 or the Republicans who support abortion rights, like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who supported his nomination in part because she was convinced he would not vote to overturn it. In Vermont, the Republican governor, Phil Scott, describes himself as \u201cpro-choice\u201d and will allow a bill to become law that will, according to CNN\u2019s report, \u201crecognize as a fundamental right the freedom of reproductive choice\u201d and \u201cprohibit public entities from interfering with or restricting the right of an individual to terminate the individual\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d The measure would also protect \u201crights to choose or refuse contraception or sterilization or to choose to carry a pregnancy to term, to give birth to a child, or to obtain an abortion.\u201d Collins and Scott are Northeastern Republicans who support abortion rights. There are Democrats in the South who do not. A Louisiana bill that would outlaw abortions after six weeks of pregnancy \u2013 it is among a raft of bills that states have passed in recent months \u2013 was introduced by a Democrat, state Sen. John Milkovich, and it is a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, who has said he would sign it. A much more restrictive law that passed in Alabama drew criticism from Republicans with strong anti-abortion-rights records, like Mitt Romney, and those newer to the issue, like Trump. Romney: I don't support Alabama abortion law And some politicians, of course, try to have it all ways. The Democratic front-runner in the 2020 presidential primary race, former Vice President Joe Biden, had a long career as a dealmaker in the Senate, where he supported the Hyde Amendment. But this week Biden endorsed repealing the amendment, according to reports. Biden, who is Catholic, has long said he personally opposes abortion, but has supported abortion rights. During a 2012 vice presidential debate, he talked about how his religion played a role in his views. \u201cI accept my Church\u2019s position on abortion as a what we call de fide doctrine. Life begins at conception. That\u2019s the Church\u2019s judgment. I accept it in my personal life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews. I just refuse to impose that on others,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI do not believe that we have a right to tell other people, women, that they can\u2019t control their bodies. That\u2019s a decision between them and their doctor, in my view, and the Supreme Court, I\u2019m not going to interfere with that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "5. Abortion emerging as an issue:\u00a0With Alabama passing legislation last week that effectively banned abortion (with the lone exception of when the life of the mother is in danger), the issue roared back into the conversation on the campaign trail. The two questions now: How long will it last and will one Democratic candidate emerge as the voice of the opposition in the abortion fight. On the first one, it seems likely that abortion will remain front and center \u2013 due in large part to a series of laws passed by Republican-controlled state governments in Ohio, Georgia and Missouri, among others. On the second, it\u2019s tougher to predict \u2013 although New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is clearly hoping to use the issue as a momentum springboard. She traveled to Georgia last week to protest that state\u2019s passage of a fetal heartbeat bill,\u00a0condemning the \u201cnationwide assault on women\u2019s constitutional rights by ideological extremists.\u201d 4. Iowa \u2013 or bust: You might have missed\u00a0Steve Bullock\u2019s entry into the 2020 race last week. Which is understandable because the Montana governor is not seen as a top- (or even second-) tier candidate. But Bullock may wind up being a bit of a trendsetter in one way: He\u2019s focusing his campaign on Iowa and Iowa alone. He told CNN last week that he planned to \u201cspend a lot of my time in Iowa\u201d\u00a0and made a semi-splash when Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller endorsed his candidacy. With SO many Democrats running, my guess is there will be more lower-tier candidates like Bullock who try to camp out in either Iowa or New Hampshire \u2013 the first two states to vote \u2013 in hopes that lavishing a single state with all their time and money will lead to a surprisingly strong finish. 3. Trump goes to Pennsylvania: As he ramps up his 2020 campaign \u2013 in truth he never really ramped it down \u2013 the president will hold a rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania Monday night. That rally follows one earlier this month in Panama City Beach, Florida. And one late last month in Green Bay, Wisconsin. A month before that \u2013 late March \u2013 Trump held a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Remember that a president\u2019s time is the most valuable resource in any reelection campaign. So if you need to know where the Trump team thinks the election is going to be won and lost, just look at where the President has spent his time at rallies so far this year. Trump won all four states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida \u2013 in 2016. He probably needs at least two of those four \u2013 and maybe three \u2013 to win a second term. And his campaign team knows it. 2. You get a town hall! And you get a town hall!: Starting Sunday night, there will be three town halls this week featuring three different 2020 Democrats on three different networks. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg kicks things off tonight with a Fox News town hall in New Hampshire. (Buttigieg is the third Democrat to participate in a Fox town hall \u2013 following Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.) Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts very publicly said last week she would not participate in a Fox News-sponsored town hall. On Tuesday, it\u2019s former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s turn, as he is featured in a CNN town hall in Iowa. Two days later, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is in Iowa for an MSNBC town hall. Why so many town halls? Networks love them because they do well in ratings. Candidates love them because it\u2019s an hour, uninterrupted, on national TV \u2013 a chance to build momentum (in the case of Booker and O\u2019Rourke) or keep it up (Buttigieg). 1. Biden (and the rest): The former vice president officially entered the presidential race (although he was already in!) over the weekend, with a kickoff speech in Philadelphia. Here\u2019s the key bit: \u201cSome say Democrats don\u2019t want to hear about unity. That they are angry \u2013 and the angrier you are \u2013 the better. That\u2019s what they are saying to have to do to win the Democratic nomination. Well, I don\u2019t believe it. I believe Democrats want to unify this nation.\u201d That message is aimed squarely at the party\u2019s most liberal voters \u2013 and 2020 candidates \u2013 who see Biden\u2019s appeal to electability as a red herring. But Biden is clearly framing the race on these terms \u2013 I am the one who can beat Trump \u2013 and forcing the other candidates to prove him wrong. At the moment, it\u2019s working. Biden has established himself as the clear frontrunner in the race after less than a month as a candidate.",

            "article_content": "The 2020 Democratic primary, which already boasts more than 20 candidates, may seem tame compared to a House race in the Bronx. A couple of months after veteran Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano announced he would retire in 2020, some Democrats in New York and Washington have grown worried that Councilman Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr., a 76-year-old, cowboy hat-wearing Pentecostal minister known for his constituent services and controversial statements on social issues, could be elected to Congress in a deep blue district next to one led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. While the presidential contenders quibble over policy, this congressional race has already turned personal. Councilman Ritchie Torres \u2014 the first out gay person to hold elected office in the borough and a likely competitor in the race \u2014 told CNN, \u201cRub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr. is the most vicious homophobe in New York State politics.\u201d D\u00edaz, a self-proclaimed \u201cconservative Democrat\u201d is out of step with the national party\u2019s views on abortion and same-sex marriage. He was the only Democrat in the state Senate to vote against a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in 2011. And he has been sharply criticized in recent months for saying the City Council is \u201ccontrolled by the homosexual community\u201d; he was subsequently stripped of his chairmanship of the For-Hire Vehicle committee and urged to resign by the City Council Speaker Corey Johnson. D\u00edaz did not respond to multiple requests from CNN for comment on this story. He has said publicly that he is in favor of traditional family values and is attacked for espousing them. \u201cWhat I said is not homophobic, it\u2019s the truth,\u201d D\u00edaz told the New York Daily News in February, adding he was the \u201cvictim\u201d amid the demands for him to apologize. But D\u00edaz, who previously served in the New York State Senate for 15 years, is viewed as a strong contender in the campaign with a proven base of support, especially among senior citizens, ministers through his New York Hispanic Clergy Organization and taxi cab drivers. \u201cNo one should underestimate Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr.,\u201d said US Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, who has not endorsed anyone in the emerging race. \u201cThe voters know him.\u201d D\u00edaz is set to face Torres and Assemblyman Michael Blake, a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee who will officially announce his campaign at a rally Sunday, in the primary. Torres told CNN it is \u201cextremely probable\u201d that he will run for Serrano\u2019s seat. He said he would focus on issues like increasing federal investment in public housing, building on his work as the chairman of the relevant committee in the City Council. In a separate interview, Blake said his record on criminal justice reform issues \u2014 including boosting efforts to raise the age of criminal responsibility, banning commercial bail and helping charitable bail organizations assist poor people \u2014 can\u2019t be beat. Yet, they both turned their sharpest comments for D\u00edaz Sr. In calling out his controversial statements regarding the gay community, Torres said D\u00edaz Sr. should be running in the Republican primary instead. And Blake called D\u00edaz\u2019s rhetoric \u201cabsolutely unacceptable,\u201d \u201cdivisive,\u201d \u201chateful\u201d and \u201cnot at all becoming of someone that should be running for Congress or quite frankly an elected office.\u201d A week ago, local media reported that D\u00edaz said at a City Council sexual harassment training session, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna rat my people out!\u201d Legislators including Torres quickly began writing bills to tighten the rules for reporting such incidents. Blake told CNN his comments were \u201cappalling.\u201d D\u00edaz responded that the reports had \u201cdistorted\u201d what he said, arguing he has \u201cimmediately addressed any sexual harassment or bullying if I have even suspected that a woman has felt uncomfortable when someone is violating the rules.\u201d Paul Lipson, a former chief of staff for Serrano, said that aspects of the current congressman\u2019s legacy \u2014 from restoring the Bronx river to his work on immigrants\u2019 rights \u2014 will last. \u201cBut I do think that the values that he brought to the seat may not endure,\u201d he added. D\u00edaz Sr. boasts multiple advantages in a congressional race, from sharing the same name as his son, Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, to having a defined constituency in a multi-candidate race. And more may come besides Torres and Blake: Marlene Cintron, the president of the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, told CNN she was considering running and will make her decision in June or July. \u201cIf it\u2019s more than two candidates running in the same race that he\u2019s in, I\u2019m afraid that he is going to be the next member of Congress from that district,\u201d said Gerson Borrero, a NY1 political commentator, told CNN. \u201cHe does have a base, which is a problem with this guy.\u201d The South Bronx district is poorer and less white than the one next door represented by Ocasio-Cortez. But it\u2019s even more Democratic. Serrano, who has served the district for almost 30 years and is the longest-serving Puerto-Rican member of Congress, won reelection in 2018 with 96% of the vote. The demographics of the district \u2014 about two-thirds Latino and one-third black\u2014could favor Latino candidates like D\u00edaz Sr. or Torres. \u201cOur primary voters in the district skew older and slightly, every so slightly more socially conservative than you might expect in such a thoroughly Democratic district,\u201d Lipson said. He said that every candidate\u2019s challenge will be to motivate people to come out to vote next June, when segments of the electorate, particularly young people, don\u2019t. All of these factors are on the minds of some of the Democratic members of Congress from New York. In interviews, they generally praised Torres and Blake \u2014 who worked on Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign and then in the White House \u2014 while noting others could also join the race. But the conversation turned sour when asked about D\u00edaz Sr. Rep. Adriano Espaillat said Torres is \u201cone of the good candidates\u201d and Blake is \u201calso a worthy candidate.\u201d When asked about D\u00edaz, Espaillat said, \u201cWe\u2019ll leave that one.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, who serves the neighboring district, said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that D\u00edaz entered the race. \u201cHe has a disturbing track record towards the LGBT American community,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told CNN. She said she would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d support his candidacy. (D\u00edaz has claimed he is the \u201copposite\u201d of Ocasio-Cortez.) Another member of the delegation said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real concern right now that he\u2019s guaranteed to win that race, but people are monitoring the situation.\u201d To be sure, there will be other issues in the race besides D\u00edaz\u2019s candidacy. Torres called for a congressional investigation into Trump administration\u2019s \u201calmost willfully starving\u201d of Puerto Rico. And he has straddled ideological lines, supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary, without embracing that candidate\u2019s signature issues like single-payer health care or the Green New Deal. Torres calls himself a \u201cpragmatic progressive\u201d that wants to \u201cmaximize\u201d renewable energy and supports \u201cat a minimum\u201d providing a public health insurance option. He notes all the hospitals in the area and says he wants to hear from the unions before considering more sweeping overhaul of the health care sector. \u201cThe residents of the South Bronx are largely motivated by bread and butter concerns, a struggle to survive in the most expensive city in the world in a city that\u2019s becoming crushingly unaffordable,\u201d he said. As for Blake, he\u2019s pitching a \u201cbelieve in the Bronx\u201d campaign, while trying to prove that he can win a race for Congress after losing a campaign for New York City Public Advocate in a special election earlier this year. He said the campaign raised his profile and he has plenty of time before the congressional primary. \u201cI already represent a Latino-majority district and been elected three times,\u201d Blake said. \u201cPeople are looking for a vision, they\u2019re not just looking to you because of race.\u201d \u201cI think this is about people deciding who is the best representative for us, not just on ethnicity and background but truly who can unite,\u201d he added. But on one thing, both agree: Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz Sr. needs to go.",

            "article_content": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio entered the 2020 Democratic presidential primary Thursday morning, casting himself as the most accomplished progressive pick in a field of 23 candidates vying for a chance to challenge President Donald Trump next year. In his announcement video, de Blasio took aim at Trump, calling him a \u201cbully,\u201d then in an interview on ABC later in the morning said the President is \u201cplaying a big con on America.\u201d \u201cEvery New Yorker knows, he\u2019s a con artist,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cWe know his tricks, we know his playbook.\u201d The mayor also touted a slate of policy wins, including universal Pre-K and his successful push for a $15 minimum wage. Why 2020 hopefuls like to announce their plans at the crack of dawn \u201cI know we can do it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve done it here in the largest, toughest city in this country.\u201d De Blasio will hit the trail later Thursday, visiting Iowa before heading to South Carolina for events this weekend. The two-term mayor, who in 2017 became the first Democrat re-elected to his office in more than three decades, joins the race after months of deliberations and a handful of visits to early-voting states. Even before he made his plans official, de Blasio has come under fire \u2013 and some mockery \u2013 from the city\u2019s unrelenting press corps, a group he\u2019s clashed with repeatedly over the years and which openly delights in the mayor\u2019s every misstep or misfortune. Still, his national profile is less defined, and de Blasio, as he introduces himself to Democrats outside New York, is expected to sell a record of progressive policy wins \u2013 bolstered by a racially diverse coalition of support \u2013 in a city with more residents than the home states of some of his rivals. The questions dogging de Blasio, which tend to boil down to a simple \u201cWhy?,\u201d will be familiar to him. His first campaign for mayor was greeted with similar skepticism and doubt, if not the hostility and contempt generated by his presidential ambitions. A recent poll of New Yorkers found 76% of them did not think he should run. Whether de Blasio can transform those perceptions on the national stage \u2013 where he\u2019s already been roasted by The Onion, which joked in a headline last week, \u201cDe Blasio PAC Spends $30 Million On Ads Urging Candidate Not To Embarrass Self By Running\u201d \u2013 will be his first test. Here are the 22 Democrats who have said they're running for president \u201cI think Bill de Blasio has a toxic relationship with the press corps that covers him. It goes both ways,\u201d former aide Rebecca Katz, who is not involved in his new campaign, told CNN. \u201cAnd that\u2019s going to make it very hard for this run because wherever he will be, whatever small town in Iowa or New Hampshire, he will have NY1 and the New York Post front and center. Whether he likes it or not.\u201d The Post has already been alongside the mayor during some early test runs. When he got caught in an Iowa snowstorm, it crowed over his decision \u2013 reportedly unsuccessful \u2013 to drive through the blizzard. When he was forced to stopover at a motel, the tabloid gleefully reported that, \u201cinstead of enjoying some of the Hawkeye State\u2019s award-winning barbecue or succulent steaks, he had to make do with a microwaved burrito.\u201d But the press hasn\u2019t been all bad \u2013 even when it\u2019s been critical. De Blasio\u2019s climate protest this week outside Trump Tower, which had to be moved inside Trump Tower because of the weather, set off a Twitter clash with President Donald Trump\u2019s son, Eric. Their back-and-forth led Fox News host and Trump super-ally Sean Hannity to name de Blasio his \u201cVillain of the Day\u201d \u2013 a designation most Democratic primary candidates would gladly wear. De Blasio\u2019s candidacy begins now in earnest now, but he has been running against Trump and national Republicans for some time. At his November 2017 re-election party in Brooklyn, he said the city had \u201csent a message: You can\u2019t take on New York values and win, Mr. President. If you turn against the values of your hometown, your hometown will fight back.\u201d When the Alabama state legislature passed its near total abortion ban this week, he called it \u201cvile and illegal\u201d in a tweet and then urged the state\u2019s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, to come down \u201con the right side of history\u201d and veto the bill. De Blasio 2020? So far, polls say voters don't want it De Blasio\u2019s status at home has taken a hit as he ventured more openly into national politics. The popular policies \u2013 like universal pre-K and raising the minimum wage \u2013 have mostly disappeared from the headlines, which have focused on speculation over potential fundraising scandals and stories about the mayor\u2019s commuting habits. The murder rate in New York City is low and declined again last year, but economic inequality \u2013 the focus of de Blasio\u2019s first campaign \u2013 remains a problem, as does the public housing authority, which has left many tenants living in squalor. De Blasio\u2019s constant feuding with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, most visibly over the city\u2019s troubled subway system, which is run by the state, also means he won\u2019t enter this primary with much support from statewide leaders. Still, predictions of de Blasio\u2019s imminent unraveling should be tempered \u2013 as history suggests. \u201cThere was no one who believed Bill de Blasio was going to win (in 2013),\u201d Katz said. \u201cEveryone thought he was crazy. He was in single digits right up until a few months before Election Day and he proved them wrong and then he went ahead and prove the pundits wrong when they said he couldn\u2019t get universal Pre-K done, and then did in his first year.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Just because a bill becomes law doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll take effect. That\u2019s especially true with Alabama\u2019s new abortion law, the strictest in the country. The law makes abortion illegal in virtually all cases \u2013 including cases of rape and incest. It also says doctors who perform an abortion could face up to 99 years in prison \u2013 similar to punishment for rapists and murderers. But there are still hurdles ahead. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s next for the abortion law: The new law isn\u2019t enforceable until six months after Gov. Kay Ivey signed the legislation, which just happened Wednesday. So the earliest this law could take effect would be November. Fact check: Is the Alabama anti-abortion law likely to go into effect? The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood Southeast have already announced plans to file lawsuits against the Alabama law, saying it\u2019s unconstitutional. 25 men voted for the restrictive abortion ban in the US. A female governor signed it. Both groups have a history of asking federal district courts for a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. And federal district judges often block anti-abortion laws from taking effect while legal challenges are underway. Whichever side loses will likely file an appeal. That appeal would be heard by the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Alabama, Georgia and Florida. All this legal wrangling could last years. In fact, the Alabama legislation was designed specifically to go to the Supreme Court and challenge Roe v. Wade \u2013 the 1973 decision that legalized abortion in the US, said Eric Johnston, president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition. The coalition helped draft the Alabama bill. Will Chief Justice John Roberts try to overturn Roe v. Wade? But it can take years for the Supreme Court to hear a case, if it chooses to hear the case at all. The nation\u2019s highest court decides which cases it wants to take, and it might not take up the Alabama law if it\u2019s struck down in lower courts. The American Civil Rights Union of Alabama said it doubts the Alabama law will lead to Roe v. Wade getting overturned. \u201cThere are already 14 cases nationwide in the pipeline, two of which are currently at the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director Randall Marshall said. \u201cThe notion that somehow this is going to be the vehicle for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade is really misplaced.\u201d Watching for the Supreme Court to set terms for an eventual Roe v. Wade showdown Even if the high court decides to hear the Alabama case, it likely wouldn\u2019t do so until after the 2020 presidential election. To illustrate how long this could take, Louisiana passed a law back in 2014 that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 miles. That case could be heard by the Supreme Court in 2020 \u2013 six years after the law was passed. And it\u2019s not certain what the Supreme Court would look like if or when it hears the Alabama case. Right now, there\u2019s a 5-4 partisan split between conservative and liberal judges. CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand and Caroline Kelly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Alabama state legislature passed a measure that would ban abortion \u2013 with the exception of when the life of the mother is in jeopardy \u2013 in all circumstances. The state\u2019s Republican governor \u2013 Kay Ivey \u2013 signed it on Wednesday, meaning two things will happen: 1) Alabama will become the state with the country\u2019s most restrictive abortion law and 2) the law will immediately become fodder for the swirling debate over if (and when) the Supreme Court might consider overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling. That two-pronged goal was clearly the intent of the bill\u2019s sponsor \u2013 state Rep. Terry Collins (R), who said after the vote: \u201cThis bill is about challenging Roe v. Wade and protecting the lives of the unborn, because an unborn baby is a person who deserves love and protection.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! It quite clearly will challenge the ruling, since prohibiting abortion in all but one case seems to directly come into conflict with the Supreme Court\u2019s finding that it is against the law to place an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman seeking an abortion before a viable fetus \u2013 one that can live outside the womb \u2013 emerges. And while the Alabama law is the strictest in the nation \u2013 and therefore most at-odds with established federal law \u2013 is it far from the only piece of abortion legislation that seeks to push the boundaries of Roe. Last month, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a so-called \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law, which bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can come as early as the 6-week mark \u2013 a time when some women may still not even know they are pregnant. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a similar measure earlier this month. These laws will almost immediately be appealed \u2013 and will join a growing list of cases that could arrive at the doorstep of the Supreme Court in the not-too-distant future. The court is poised in upcoming months to consider hearing a challenge to a Louisiana law that would force doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where an abortion is performed, a stricture that those opposed to the law insist violates the \u201cundue burden\u201d notion. According to CNN Supreme Court expert Joan Biskupic, the court calendar could well mean that a ruling on the Louisiana law comes down in the summer of 2020 \u2013 right in the heart of the presidential campaign. Now, the court rejected a Texas law very similar to the Louisiana one back in 2016. But \u2013 and this is the point \u2013 that was a very, very different court. For starters, there were only eight members. Senate Republicans refused to meet with or hold confirmation hearings for then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee \u2013 Merrick Garland \u2013 citing the fact that it was too close to a presidential election for the outgoing Obama to make such a consequential pick. When that ninth spot on the court was eventually filled, it was with Neil Gorsuch, a conservative selected by President Donald Trump. The other big difference between the 2016 court and today\u2019s court? Swing vote Anthony Kennedy has been traded out for conservative Brett Kavanaugh. Which means that there are five conservative justices and four liberals on the court. The new court\u2019s makeup has many legal experts convinced that the next time a serious challenge to Roe is heard, the law will be struck down. \u201cAnthony Kennedy is retiring. Abortion will be illegal in twenty states in 18 months. #SCOTUS,\u201d tweeted CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin in June 2018. And Trump, for his part, has been transparent about his desire to see Roe overturned. Witness this exchange with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace in the late stages of the 2016 campaign: WALLACE: You just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade? TRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that\u2019s really what\u2019s going to be \u2014 that will happen and that will happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. That \u2013 \u201cput another two or perhaps three justices on\u201d \u2013 is, of course, exactly what Trump has done in the two-plus years he has been President. Other experts are less certain that Roe will be eliminated anytime soon \u2013 no matter what Trump thinks. Wrote Biskupic earlier this month: \u201cRapid and dramatic moves by states to ban abortion at six weeks of pregnancy appear to set up an immediate fight over Roe v. Wade. But such direct challenges to the 1973 milestone are years from any Supreme Court hearing, and advocates on both sides are more urgently strategizing over the pending cases that would establish the terms for the eventual showdown.\u201d The more likely outcome, she believes, is the court taking incremental steps on Roe as opposed to wiping the law out in one fell swoop. And, when gaming out how the court would rule on even these incremental measures, it may be too facile to simply look at the five conservative justices and assume they will automatically vote for anything that chips away at the abortion law. Chief Justice John Roberts, who was appointed to the court by President George W. Bush, has repeatedly emphasized his concern about the court breaking with past precedents, which would seemingly include Roe. \u201cIt is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent,\u201d Roberts told then-Sen. Arlen Specter (Pa.) at his 2005 confirmation hearing. \u201cPrecedent plays an important role in promoting stability and even handedness.\u201d Roberts seemed to stick by that view in a February ruling in which he sided with the four liberal justices to block the Louisiana law. And even Kavanaugh deferred to precedent when asked about Roe during his confirmation hearings. \u201cAs a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade,\u201d he said. (Worth noting: He wrote a 2003 memo in which he said the Supreme Court \u201ccan always overrule\u201d Roe.) The point here is two-fold. First, there\u2019s no doubt that legislation like the abortion ban in Alabama is aimed at the larger goal of prohibiting abortion nationwide. Second, the court has been mysterious enough on the issue to make it very difficult to predict with certainty how it might rule \u2013 and when \u2013 on these challenges to Roe. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly state that the Supreme Court is poised to consider hearing a challenge to the Louisiana law.",

            "article_content": "Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has postponed a planned trip to Los Angeles as many big names in Hollywood have responded with outrage over recently passed anti-abortion legislation, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported Tuesday. The AJC said Kemp would no longer attend an event slated for next week and noted the timing of the delay came in the wake of Kemp signing into law a controversial bill that would generally ban abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected. Fetal heartbeat detection can come as soon as six weeks into a pregnancy \u2013 when many women don\u2019t yet know they are pregnant. Cody Hall, Kemp\u2019s spokesman, told CNN that they had \u201cconfirmed a date to go out to LA this fall.\u201d \u201cIn the meantime, the Governor will be touring production studios in GA to meet with employees and reaffirm his commitment to the film industry in our state,\u201d Hall said. In recent years, following the passage of a tax incentive, Georgia has been the site of increasing film and television production, with the entertainment industry becoming a high-profile and widely-championed sector of the state\u2019s economy. But the recent passage of one of the strictest anti-abortion bills in the country has been met with condemnation by filmmakers, some of whom have said they will avoid production in the state because of the measure. Others, including directors J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele, said they would continue to shoot in the state but donate their fees to the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia and a Georgia election reform group. Kemp signed the legislation earlier this month. Legal groups, including the ACLU, have pledged to challenge the law and called it an illegal infringement on established rights to abortion access. Georgia GOP Sen. David Perdue said on Monday he doesn\u2019t think the backlash from Hollywood would hurt his state\u2019s economy. CNN\u2019s Dave Alsup and Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Seven months after he joined the US Supreme Court, the cloud of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s sexual assault allegations still hangs over Justice Brett Kavanaugh, recalled in media reports across the political spectrum and unresolved in the US judiciary\u2019s own process for handling related ethics claims. The names of Kavanaugh and Ford were repeatedly invoked in news stories as former Vice President Joe Biden entered the 2020 presidential race last week and began addressing his treatment of Anita Hill in the 1991 Supreme Court hearings for Clarence Thomas \u2013 a point of comparison with the Ford-Kavanaugh face-off in the Senate last fall. Stephen Moore, President Donald Trump\u2019s newly withdrawn nominee to the Federal Reserve, said his media critics were \u201cpulling a Kavanaugh\u201d against him with complaints related to his regard for women. At the same time, formal ethics grievances filed against Kavanaugh based on his testimony in response to the Ford sexual-assault allegations are moving to a higher level of the judicial misconduct process. The latest GOP Hail Mary is the 'Brett Kavanaugh defense' The Ford connection was reinforced when Time Magazine recently named both as among the \u201c100 Most Influential Americans,\u201d a move that itself generated a flood of public commentary, for and against. One of those comments, from actress Jessica Chastain, triggered a separate round of media coverage. She wrote on Twitter: \u201cYou put her on the same list as the man she said assaulted her. So disappointing @TIME.\u201d The Time entry honoring Kavanaugh was penned by Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who helped ensure the vote that got Kavanaugh on the bench, writing that the nominee\u2019s response demonstrated \u201chis resilience.\u201d Attention on Kavanaugh, now 54, will only rise as the Supreme Court finishes its term. The jurist who succeeded centrist conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely to change the outcome of some closely watched cases, moving the law in America to the right. Among the disputes to be resolved before the traditional end-of-June deadline are those over a 40-foot \u201cPeace Cross\u201d on public ground in Maryland, partisan gerrymanders in North Carolina and Maryland, and a proposed citizenship question on the 2020 census. The court could also soon announce whether it will consider an appeal over a controversial Indiana abortion law. One question, particularly swirling in conservative circles, is whether Kavanaugh might mute his conservatism and join with Chief Justice John Roberts to avoid some social policy flashpoints such as abortion or rule narrowly to prevent a dramatic rightward shift. What the Supreme Court is doing behind closed doors A Denver-based judicial council last December dismissed a total of 83 complaints (some of which were unconnected to Ford), saying it lacked authority to address the claims because Kavanaugh, as a Supreme Court justice, was no longer covered by the judiciary\u2019s ethics code. That decision was reinforced by the judicial council in March. Now some of those complaints have been appealed to a conduct committee of the US Judicial Conference, the top policy-making arm of the third branch, overseen by Roberts. There is no deadline for any investigation or another dismissal. The high-court exemption can protect justices from scrutiny, but it also leaves claims \u2013 both frivolous and with merit \u2013 unanswered in the public eye. Ford, a Palo Alto University professor, accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers just outside of Washington. Kavanaugh declined, through a spokeswoman, to comment on the ongoing claims or public attention tied to the Ford allegations. Palo Alto University referred questions for Ford to Ricki Seidman, a Democratic political strategist advising Ford. Seidman was a Senate Judiciary Committee staffer during the Hill-Thomas hearings in 1991 and in 2009 helped prepare Sonia Sotomayor, President Barack Obama\u2019s first high court nominee, for her confirmation. \u201cChristine hasn\u2019t made any public comments and doesn\u2019t have any current intentions to do so,\u201d Seidman wrote in an email to CNN. Kavanaugh was sworn in at the Supreme Court on October 6, immediately after the Senate vote. A large crowd of protesters surged onto the front steps of the marble-columned building, pounding on doors and chanting, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, Kavanaugh has got to go.\u201d Three days later at the White House, the President apologized to Kavanaugh for the hearing ordeal and said, as the other eight justices sat in the audience, that Kavanaugh had been \u201cproven innocent.\u201d But Ford\u2019s claim was never truly tested, neither conclusively dismissed nor conclusively validated. The continuing controversy over whether judicial ethics grievances can be resolved does not involve any behavior tied to Kavanaugh\u2019s teenage years but rather his testimony before senators last fall. In his televised September 27 appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh emphatically denied Ford\u2019s accusations. He asserted that her claims arose from \u201ca calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election \u2026 revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\u201d Among the 83 misconduct claims filed against Kavanaugh were those alleging that his response to the Ford accusation was inappropriately partisan, demonstrating bias and a lack of judicial temperament. Others accused him of making false statements during the 2018 hearings and in 2004 and 2006 when he was being considered for a seat on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. When a US appeals court\u2019s judicial council considered the complaints, which had been referred to it by Chief Justice Roberts, the council said the claims could not be examined or resolved because Kavanaugh, once confirmed to the high court, was exempt from the 1980 judicial misconduct law. \u201cThe allegations contained in the complaints are serious,\u201d the 10th Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich wrote, \u201cbut the Judicial Council is obligated to adhere to the Act. Lacking statutory authority to do anything more, the complaints must be dismissed because of an intervening event \u2013 Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court \u2013 has made the complaints no longer appropriate for consideration under the Act.\u201d In March, after 20 of the complainants had appealed, the 10th Circuit council reaffirmed that decision. \u201cThe lack of jurisdiction over Justice Kavanaugh precludes an investigative and fact-finding process, even over conduct allegedly committed while Justice Kavanaugh was a covered judge,\u201d the council wrote. A number of complainants have now appealed to the US Judicial Conference Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability. The National Law Journal first reported this week on the new, mostly confidential, Kavanaugh-related filings. Kansas Supreme Court says abortion protected by state's Constitution, blocks law banning second trimester abortions David Sellers, spokesman for the Administrative Office of the US Courts, said such appeals to the Judicial Conduct and Disability Committee are generally not made public and there is no timetable for the review. Any final opinion from the conduct committee regarding the appeals would be published online on the federal courts\u2019 site. Paul Horvitz, a financial writer based in Massachusetts and one of the few people who has spoken publicly about his complaint against Kavanaugh, told CNN he believes the silence of the judicial branch undermines public confidence in the courts. He referred to the television audience that watched the Kavanaugh hearings last September. \u201cMillions of Americans who assume that judges act impartially were eyewitnesses to a textbook violation, by no less than a Supreme Court nominee, of \u2026 \u2018inappropriately partisan statements,\u2019 \u201d Horvitz wrote in his petition. \u201cThe public at large may have been unaware of the specifics of the Code and Rules, but vast numbers undoubtedly saw something wrong.\u201d In the meantime, as the 2018-19 court session winds down, Kavanaugh, like the other justices, has begun scheduling extracurricular activities. That has not been without controversy. After the Virginia-based George Mason University law school hired him to teach a course on the origins of the US Constitution in Runnymede, England, this summer, some students protested and urged the university to cancel the teaching arrangement. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to teach summer class in England for George Mason law George Mason University President Angel Cabrera responded on March 27 that he has \u201crespect\u201d for those who disagreed with Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, but the invitation will not be rescinded. \u201cThe law school has determined that the involvement of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice contributes to making our law program uniquely valuable for our students,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cAnd I accept their judgment. This decision, controversial as it may be, in no way affects the university\u2019s ongoing efforts to eradicate sexual violence from our campuses.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg signaled the start of a new political era for Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of the front-runners for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, with five crisp words. With those five words during last week\u2019s CNN town hall marathon \u2013 \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so\u201d \u2013 the South Bend, Indiana, mayor briskly rejected Sanders\u2019 proposal to allow convicted felons to vote not only after, but during, their incarceration. In the process Buttigieg did something that Hillary Clinton almost never did during her 2016 primary contest against Sanders: He directly criticized the substance of one of the senator\u2019s policy proposals. Buttigieg\u2019s dismissal of Sanders\u2019 idea to let felons vote \u2013 and the criticism from the mayor and other candidates of the senator\u2019s call to eliminate private health insurance \u2013 clearly indicated that the 2020 field isn\u2019t planning to reprise Clinton\u2019s approach of minimizing direct conflict with the Vermont independent. \u201cWhether it was the right strategy or the wrong strategy for Clinton, it was a very hands-off approach in which all of Bernie Sanders\u2019 idea were allowed to be untouched,\u201d said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group often critical of Sanders. \u201cAnd this is a very different time. For the first time really in his career, there is going to be scrutiny over his policy ideas.\u201d Sanders\u2019 agenda, seen as the liberal vanguard in 2016, has clearly widened its support in the party since, a dynamic symbolized by the House Rules Committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday on the single-payer \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal he has championed since his 2016 race. A wide array of 2020 contenders \u2013 including centrists such as former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and former Vice President Joe Biden at his first rally Monday afternoon \u2013 and Democratic House members have also embraced his proposal for a federal $15 minimum wage. Liberal groups sympathetic to Sanders say he\u2019ll benefit from greater scrutiny from other candidates than he received in his last race. Neil Sroka, communications director for Democracy for America, says greater debate over Sanders\u2019 ideas will make it easier for him to identify himself as the most progressive alternative in the field. \u201cPeople having to declare where they are on things like Medicare for All, and the rights for people to vote while in prison, is a phenomenal sorting mechanism for this party,\u201d Sroka says. But there\u2019s no question that greater scrutiny and pushback from the other candidates will expose Sanders to challenges he never truly faced from Clinton in 2016. Though his core idea of transforming the health care system into a single-payer structure has more support than in 2016, it remains far short of a majority in either chamber and has drawn almost no backing from congressional Democrats in swing states and House districts. (The $15 minimum wage, though much more likely to pass the House, for now also remains just short of a majority amid resistance from some swing district members.) Deeply ideological, and often prickly when challenged in media interviews, Sanders has often brushed away criticism of his agenda by dismissing any skeptics as servants of \u201cthe billionaire class.\u201d In the coming months, he\u2019ll likely need more supple responses to fellow Democrats questioning ideas such as single-payer health care or tuition-free public college from a center-left perspective. \u201cHe\u2019s being treated like a serious candidate, and his ideas are being treated like they are serious ideas,\u201d said Kessler. The absence of debate over Sanders\u2019 agenda in 2016 reflected a conscious choice by front-runner Clinton\u2019s campaign. Despite Sanders\u2019 unexpectedly strong performance, her camp\u2019s confidence that she would ultimately win the nomination never wavered after she demonstrated a commanding advantage among African American voters in the South Carolina primary early in the calendar. Because Clinton always expected to clasp the nomination, she sought to minimize conflict with Sanders so as to limit rifts with his supporters that she would need to bridge in the general election. (As it turned out, bad blood with the Sanders camp persisted anyway and hurt Clinton that November.) \u201cThe attacks in 2016, frankly, did not come (from Clinton) to the magnitude that could have been expected,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Sanders during that race. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t that level of engagement. I think their general strategy was: We\u2019re not going to engage.\u201d One senior official in the 2016 Clinton campaign, who asked not to be identified in order to discuss its internal deliberations at the time, confirmed Devine\u2019s perspective. \u201cI think there were two decisions about how to take on Bernie Sanders in 2016,\u201d the former official said. \u201cOne was not to litigate ideological turf wars within the Democratic primary and two was to more often than not avoid being negative towards him at all. Both were driven by the assumption that she would be the nominee, and we wanted those voters who voted against her in the primary to have an easy transition to supporting her in the general.\u201d To the extent that Clinton did criticize Sanders during the primaries, she mostly questioned not the desirability but only the political and legislative viability of his ideas. On Sanders\u2019 signature proposal to create a single-payer health care system in which the government would replace all private insurance, for instance, Clinton offered almost no assessment of whether it was a worthwhile goal. Instead she argued that single payer was unlikely to pass Congress and questioned whether it was wise to reconfigure the health care system again so soon after passing the Affordable Care Act in 2010. \u201cRather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather (than) starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let\u2019s make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody,\u201d she said at an April 2016 CNN debate with Sanders in Brooklyn. Clinton often wrapped herself in the mantle of Barack Obama, portraying her ideas as an extension of his and Sanders\u2019 agenda as an implicit rejection of them. The sole issue on which Clinton consistently criticized Sanders during the primaries was one where she could position herself to his left: gun control, a question on which he had taken some positions sympathetic to the National Rifle Association while representing the heavily rural state of Vermont. Apart from guns, says Devine, who is not advising Sanders again for 2020, \u201cThey never went after him as hard as they could have; instead, she presented her alternative view. There was never this big fight of: That\u2019s a bad idea. They didn\u2019t want to have a big debate on these issues.\u201d This time many party centrists are spoiling for a fight over some key elements of Sanders\u2019 agenda. Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Amy Klobuchar have already renounced Sanders\u2019 idea of eliminating all private health insurance (except for a few supplemental services) in his single-payer plan as too disruptive to the 180 million Americans who receive their coverage through that means; Biden, who joined the race last week, signaled in his remarks Monday that he would join them. Sroka, the Democracy for America aide, says Sanders will benefit from more engagement than in 2016 over whether to maintain private insurance. \u201cThe point is, I think, that discussion of what it means when you say, \u2018Health care is a right,\u2019 vs. Joe Biden saying, \u2018You have a right to buy health insurance,\u2019 is a good discussion,\u201d he says. \u201cI frankly think most people when they hear it are going to side with the progressive case.\u201d But Kessler of Third Way says a more forthright debate over single payer will cause many Democratic voters to question whether they want to centralize virtually complete control over the delivery of health care in the federal government. After Trump and the Republican-led Congress passed a tax bill in 2017 that cut taxes for red states in part by limiting the state and local tax deduction that mostly benefits blue states, Kessler notes, it\u2019s easy to imagine a future Republican president manipulating a single payer plan to slash reimbursement rates for hospitals and doctors in blue coastal states, which generally have higher costs than red interior states. If the federal government controlled all health care decisions, he notes, a future conservative president also would inevitably seek to limit services in culturally sensitive areas. \u201cIf you have a government-run single payer health care, contraception is going to be a fight; abortion, too,\u201d Kessler says. \u201cAnything having to do with LGBT rights is going to be a battle. What\u2019s going to happen with immigrants, noncitizens, people who are here illegally?\u201d Likewise, Sanders\u2019 other centerpiece idea of providing tuition-free four-year public education to students from families earning $125,000 or less could spark much sharper debate than in 2016. There\u2019s broad concern in the party about the trend of states shifting more of the cost of public education from taxpayers through state appropriations to students and families through tuition. But Devine said focus groups conducted for the Sanders campaign in Iowa last time found even many Democratic voters hesitant about completely eliminating tuition and instead drawn to the notion that students and their families should contribute some of the cost. \u201cThere was a lot of pushback from that,\u201d said Devine. \u201cYou would sit in the group and people would talk about the kid down the street who\u2019s a slacker, do you want to give free tuition?\u201d Several 2020 contenders have already questioned the idea, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota most prominently. Free public university tuition for families into the upper middle class also faces criticism from another angle: groups pushing to increase admissions of low-income and minority students to high-performing public colleges and universities. They worry that those students will be displaced if more middle- and upper-middle-class white families choose free public universities over expensive mid-tier private schools. The lack of a sharp issue debate in 2016 may be one reason ideology was only a modest fault line in the Clinton-Sanders race: The senator ran somewhat better among liberal than among moderate voters, but the difference wasn\u2019t nearly as significant as other divides, particularly age and partisanship (with Sanders relying more on independents than on partisan Democrats), according to a cumulative analysis of the 2016 exit polls conducted by CNN. More focus on the implications \u2013 and the formidable cumulative cost \u2013 of Sanders\u2019 agenda could sharpen the ideological fault lines in the race, particularly with Biden, the other candidate leading in early polls, already likely to draw mostly from older and more moderate voters. Even with the other contenders likely to challenge Sanders more aggressively than Clinton did, polls show a substantial audience within the Democratic coalition for many of the key ideas he has advanced. That means there are no guarantees that his critics will win a more forthright debate than Clinton instigated over them in 2016. But it seems guaranteed Sanders will face such a debate this time \u2013 and that means his new wave of rivals will test him in ways Clinton never did.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden is in \u2013 and the knives are out. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts welcomed the former vice president to the 2020 Democratic primary on Thursday by reminding voters of their old clashes over the nation\u2019s bankruptcy laws. \u201cI got in that fight because (families) just didn\u2019t have anyone and Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies,\u201d Warren said after being asked about the issue following a rally in Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of public record.\u201d The nearly two-decade-old Warren-Biden feud is, indeed, well documented. Warren has, in multiple interviews and op-eds, criticized Biden, during his time in the Senate, over his role in moving along legislation she believed would benefit big banks at the expense of working and middle-class Americans. Warren was joined by her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders in jabbing Biden, who is poised to head up the moderate Democratic opposition to President Donald Trump in a year when progressive primary candidates have been dominating the headlines. Both of the New England senators view Biden as an ideological foe that, despite his strong early polling, could ultimately provide a useful political foil. Sanders\u2019 campaign sent a pair of fundraising emails on Thursday, both with Biden\u2019s name in the subject line, pushing supporters to meet the challenge ahead. \u201cThere are a lot of candidates in this race right now. But there is only one Bernie Sanders. You know that,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, the Vermont independent\u2019s campaign manager, in both messages. The call for cash in Sanders\u2019 second email put a finer point on it, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a big day in the Democratic primary and we\u2019re hoping to end it strong. Not with a fundraiser in the home of a corporate lobbyist, but with an overwhelming number of individual donations in response to today\u2019s news. Contribute before midnight. It would mean A LOT to our campaign.\u201d But it is Warren and Biden who have the more colorful history. In a New York Times op-ed from 2002, titled \u201cA Quiet Attack on Women,\u201d Warren accused Biden of using abortion protections as political cover for his decision to support a controversial bankruptcy bill. \u201cDo politicians like Mr. Biden who support the bankruptcy bill believe they can give credit-card companies the right to elbow out women and children so long as they rally behind an issue like abortion?\u201d Warren asked her in op-ed. \u201cThe message is unmistakable: On an economic issue that attracts millions of dollars of industry support, women have no real political importance.\u201d Biden entered the 2020 contest, after months of internal debate, with a video released early Thursday. In the first 24 hours of his third presidential campaign, Biden, who held his first fundraiser on Thursday, has sought to keep the focus on Trump, framing the coming election as a referendum on the fate of a country \u2013 saying the President\u2019s reaction to the deadly white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 solidified the stakes. \u201c(Trump) said there were quote some \u2018very fine people\u2019 on both sides,\u201d Biden said in his video, recalling Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cWith those words, the President of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: The only Democrat talking at length about his faith in the 2020 primary also happens to be the only gay candidate in the race. And he\u2019s one of the few from a red state. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is an Episcopalian who can freely quote Bible verses. He\u2019s also a presidential candidate who embraces his husband on stage at campaign rallies. Combining homosexuality and Christianity might be the most natural thing in the world for Buttigieg and millions of gay Americans, but it is an iconoclastic development in American politics, where generalizations about religious freedom have in recent years been used specifically to fight advances in LGBTQ rights. For some on the religious right, like Franklin Graham, Buttigieg\u2019s identity, while it\u2019s shared by many gay Americans of faith, does not compute. Graham, in a series of critical tweets, said that being a gay Christian \u201cis something to be repentant of, not to be flaunted, praised or politicized.\u201d Presidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right\u2014God doesn\u2019t have a political party. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn\u2019t change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever. 1/3 https://t.co/QHDNY3pwzJ Mayor Buttigieg says he\u2019s a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman\u2014not two men, not two women. 2/3 The core of the Christian faith is believing and following Jesus Christ, who God sent to be the Savior of the world\u2014to save us from sin, to save us from hell, to save us from eternal damnation. 3/3 Graham\u2019s position is ironic and hypocritical given his and the religious right\u2019s embrace of Donald Trump as President. No one should presume to know another person\u2019s faith, but it is a statement of fact that Trump is a thrice-married megalomaniac who is certain in his infallibility and has mangled Bible verses when he\u2019s tried to read them out loud. But conservative faith leaders have pushed Trump and applauded him in particular for his selection of conservative Supreme Court justices like Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who they hope will challenge court precedent on abortion and marriage equality. Buttigieg has poked at this hypocrisy, questioning whether Trump believes in God. He\u2019s brought attacks on Vice President Mike Pence, who has joined the fight against gay rights and who wears his faith \u2013 he is an evangelical Christian \u2013 on his sleeve. \u201cI hope that Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith or attacks on the President as he seeks the highest office in the land,\u201d Pence told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash after Buttigieg\u2019s criticism, later adding, \u201che\u2019d do well to reflect on the importance of respecting the freedom of religion of every American.\u201d Pence says Buttigieg bringing 'attacks' on his faith Comments from leaders like Graham, a supporter of Trump who is now saying Buttigieg\u2019s interpretation of faith is flawed, will complicate Pence\u2019s argument that his own faith is being targeted by Buttigieg. What drew Graham\u2019s ire were comments at a CNN town hall this week, when Buttigieg was asked by a woman who described herself as a bisexual Christian, how he will \u201cchallenge the right\u2019s moral monopoly on Christianity to unite conservative, moderate and liberal Christians alike\u2026\u201d His full answer is worth reading, but the essence is that he acknowledged it \u201ccan be challenging to be a person of faith who\u2019s also part of the LGBTQ community\u201d while also saying his understanding of faith is far different than Pence\u2019s or Graham\u2019s: \u201cPart of where I\u2019m coming from is a faith tradition that counsels me to be as humble as possible, that counsels me to look after those who need defending. And frankly, it couldn\u2019t be more radically different than what I see certainly in this White House, where there\u2019s a lot of chest-thumping and self-aggrandizing, not to mention abusive behavior, but also a political agenda that seems to always be revolving around the idea that somehow it\u2019s too easy for poor people in this country. It\u2019s just so different than what I get when I read scripture. And I get that one of the things about scripture is different people see different things in it. But at the very least, we should be able to establish that God does not have a political party.\u201d There is still a strong religious divide in the country on the subject of gay rights. In a 2017 Pew survey, there was strong support (62%) among all Americans for same-sex marriage like the one a Supreme Court decision allows Buttigieg to enjoy. Just 32% of Americans oppose it. More than two-thirds of Americans not affiliated with a religion (85%) support it, along with Catholics (67%) and white mainline Protestants (68%). But support was less than 50% among other groups Pew broke out, including black Protestants (44% support) and white evangelical Protestants (35%). That divide carried over to political groups. Just 40% of Republicans supported same-sex marriage in the survey, compared to 73% of Democrats and 60% of Independents. There are other polls, such as this one from Pew, that document how Republicans are more likely to believe in God than Democrats, that they\u2019re more likely to go to church, and that religion plays a larger role in the lives of more Republicans than Democrats. Which is not to say that Democrats don\u2019t rely on religious voters. But they tend to focus on black churches. Trump, however, is equally or more reliant on white evangelicals to help him win re-election. Pence is not the only evangelical Christian working for the President; his press secretary Sarah Sanders said God wants Trump to be in office. It\u2019s not at all clear that Buttigieg would be able to win over more churchgoers than other candidates. Hillary Clinton, a churchgoing Methodist, spoke less often than him about her own faith, but she did talk about it. She lost in 2016, however, among people who go to church monthly or more (Clinton got 43% to Trump\u2019s 53%), according to exit polls. She won 54% - 39% among people who go less than that. The country is changing, however. In 2016, fewer than half of voters (49%) said they went to church monthly or more. In 2012, 55% of voters in exit polls said they went to church monthly or more. In 2008, it was 54%. In 2004, it was 56%. That trend of less church attendance by voters is mirrored in a 2018 Gallup survey of Americans at large that found even fewer \u2013 43% \u2013 attend church monthly or more. It was 58% when Gallup asked the question in 1992.",

            "article_content": "One of the most unique \u2013 and hard to grasp \u2013 phenomena of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy (and his time in the White House) is the solid and unwavering support he has enjoyed from evangelical Christians. Witness former presidential candidate \u2013 and former House member \u2013 Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, in an interview over the weekend with a Christian conservative radio show called \u201cUnderstanding These Times\u201d: \u201c[Trump] is highly biblical, and I would say to your listeners, we will in all likelihood never see a more godly, biblical president again in our lifetime. So we need to be not only praying for him, we need to support him, in my opinion, in every possible way that we can.\u201d (The Bachmann interview, which runs in two parts, is explained this way on the \u201cUnderstanding These Times\u201d website: \u201cJust what is the \u2018deep state\u2019 and how are they promoting end-time lawlessness? How does President Trump fulfill prophecy? A multi-billionaire cabal is pushing for global government and Michele explains who they are and why.\u201d) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Bachmann, who was one of Trump\u2019s evangelical advisers during his 2016 campaign, is far from the first prominent evangelical leader to speak of Trump in such terms. Soon after Trump\u2019s election in 2016, pastor Franklin Graham, the son of the late Billy Graham, explained it this way, \u201cNow people say, \u2018Well, Frank, but how can you defend him, when he\u2019s lived such a sordid life,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cI never said he was the best example of the Christian faith. He defends the faith. And I appreciate that very much.\u201d (Trump has been divorced twice even though divorce is forbidden by the Bible.) And David Brody, the chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network, has even written a book entitled \u201cThe Faith of Donald J. Trump: A Spiritual Biography.\u201d It\u2019s not just the leaders of the evangelical movement who back Trump. In 2016, according to exit polling, the businessman won 80% of the vote among those who described themselves as evangelical or born-again Christians. Let\u2019s start with this: It\u2019s very hard to quantify what Bachmann meant in describing Trump as \u201chighly biblical.\u201d Does that mean she believes him to be governing with the Bible as a sort of north star? That Trump is the platonic ideal of what the Bible wants in a leader? Or simply that Trump is a deeply religious person? Bachmann\u2019s comments about Trump\u2019s faith immediately followed a portion of the interview where she praised his military ban on transgender personnel, explaining that \u201che has stood up where most Republicans wouldn\u2019t dare to stand up.\u201d In fact, when evangelicals call Trump biblical, they are often talking about his policies on issues like Israel and abortion, rather than personal morality. Plenty of Bible figures had big moral failings but were considered godly overall. Regardless of what Bachmann means, it\u2019s very hard to see \u2013 based on public evidence and reporting \u2013 the religiosity of Trump that she apparently sees. Trump spoke at length \u2013 or at \u201cat length\u201d as he ever has \u2013 about his faith during the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, in July 2015. At that event, he told moderator Frank Luntz that he was a Presbyterian, adding: \u201cAnd I go to church and I love God and I love my church.\u201d He is not a regular church-goer, however, more often than not spending his Sunday mornings when in Washington, DC, at the golf club in Virginia that bears his name. Trump and first lady Melania Trump did attend church in mid-March, but the last time the President went to church before that was on Christmas Eve, according to the Washington Examiner, \u201calthough he often prays with faith leaders at the White House and with spiritual adviser Paula White, an evangelical minister from Florida.\u201d (Now, church attendance is, of course, not a requirement of a religious person. But it is often used as one of the many indicators of a religiously-infused life.) Trump also seems less than well-versed in the Bible. At a speech at Liberty University in January 2016, Trump awkwardly referenced a Bible verse this way: \u201cTwo Corinthians, 3:17, that\u2019s the whole ballgame.\u201d  According to CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond, Trump\u2019s comment drew \u201claughter from the crowd of students at Liberty University who knew Trump was attempting to refer to \u2018Second Corinthians.\u2019\u201d And although Trump has repeatedly said that the Bible is his favorite book (his own \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d is No. 2), he was unable (or unwilling?) to name his favorite verse during an interview with Bloomberg in 2015. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to get into it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause to me, that\u2019s very personal. The Bible means a lot to me, but I don\u2019t want to get into specifics.\u201d The way Trump speaks about core tenets of Christianity is also, um, not exactly a convincing testament to his faith. In that July 2015 forum, Luntz asked Trump whether he had ever asked God for forgiveness. \u201cI am not sure I have,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don\u2019t think so. I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don\u2019t bring God into that picture. I don\u2019t.\u201d As for communion \u2013 partaking of bread and wine in remembrance of Christ\u2019s body and blood and his death on the cross \u2013 Trump described it this way: \u201cWhen I drink my little wine \u2013 which is about the only wine I drink \u2013 and have my little cracker, I guess that is a form of asking for forgiveness, and I do that as often as possible because I feel cleansed.\u201d  Then there was the time, in the midst of the 2016 campaign, when Trump put cash onto the communion plate. Now, none of this is conclusive when it comes to Trump\u2019s faith. As White, Trump\u2019s spiritual adviser, told CNN in October 2016: \u201cIf he suddenly came out all religious, that would seem staged to me. Donald has never been public about his faith, and when he has tried, it has been futile. It\u2019s not his language, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not his heart.\u201d It is possible that Trump is simply an extremely private person when it comes to his faith \u2013 although if that is the case, it would stand in direct contrast to the fact that he is a very public person in absolutely every other element of his life. Sure! Faith is a difficult thing to understand \u2013 whether it\u2019s your own or, especially, someone else\u2019s. But every visible sign \u2013 from the language he uses to his personal life to his seeming lack of familiarity with the Bible \u2013 suggest that Bachmann and her fellow evangelicals are faking it until Trump makes it on religion. He has shown little interest in the basic elements of his faith \u2013 whether in politics or in his private life. And even if Trump does have a private faith that he never talks about, the idea of him as \u201chighly biblical\u2019 seems like a massive stretch.",

            "article_content": "Since early January, the Supreme Court has been considering whether to take up an Indiana abortion access law that goes to the core of landmark opinions like Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The law, signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, has been blocked from going into effect. It has a provision that says that the state can prohibit abortion that is solely motivated by the race, sex or disability of the fetus and require abortion doctors to inform patients of the prohibition. But so far, crickets from the high court. RELATED: Judge rules against North Carolina\u2019s 20-week abortion ban The court\u2019s docket reflects the case has been listed for the last eight closed-door conferences where the justices discuss pending petitions, including one held Friday morning. How the justices deal with the case could shed further light on a path forward for the newly solidified conservative majority that is facing a potential onslaught of similar petitions from emboldened conservative states and anti-abortion rights interest groups. The case also spotlights the tension that Chief Justice John Roberts faces as he balances his conservative jurisprudence with institutional concerns at the court. The inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare That tension was evident in February when a 5-4 court blocked a Louisiana law requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where the abortion is performed from going into effect. Roberts sided with the liberals on the bench to grant an emergency stay blocking the law while appeals continue. Roberts did not explain his reasoning in the unsigned order, but it is possible that he was moving gingerly because only three years ago the Court, before the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, struck down a similar law out of Texas. Kennedy was replaced last year by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and he dissented in the Louisiana case. Kavanaugh suggested the Court should allow the law to go into effect because the state had promised a 45 day \u201cregulatory transition period\u201d to determine how the law would impact clinics. He said after the transition period, if the doctors were unable to obtain admitting privileges they could come back to the high court to seek relief. RELATED: Susan Collins defends her Brett Kavanaugh vote after he dissents in abortion access case Some believe that one reason that Roberts might have cast his vote with the liberals is because he wanted the case to come before the court on a non-emergency basis with plenty of time for the parties and the justices to consider the arguments and perhaps distinguish the Louisiana case from the Texas ruling. But that is speculation. Roberts has not spoken publicly on the matter. However, he dissented when the court struck down the Texas law in 2016. \u201cWhat I hope Chief Justice Roberts recognizes is that the case is a real test of the Court\u2019s integrity and the rule of law,\u201d T.J. Tu of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who is lead counsel in the Louisiana case and plans to ask the court to consider the law on the merits for the next term. \u201cWhy would Roberts switch sides? Tu asked. \u201cMaybe he recognized that the Court has already decided the issue.\u201d Supporters of abortion rights say the Louisiana provision is an example of a law that, without medical justification, makes it more difficult for a woman to get an abortion because it would result in the closure of clinics in the state. They are fighting similar legal challenges at an unprecedented pace, likely because their opponents are seizing on the fact that Kennedy, who served at times as the swing vote on the issue, has retired. 'The Chief': John Roberts' journey from 'sober puss' to the pinnacle of American law \u201cWhat\u2019s different is not that they are passing these laws, the difference is that they think that the change in the make up of the court gives them a chance to test Roe v. Wade,\u201d Tu said. It would take the vote of four justices to take up the case. But the justices will move carefully, knowing that while it only takes four justices to grant a case, it takes five to prevail in an opinion. There could be several reasons that the court has yet to act on the Indiana law. The justices could be deciding whether they want to grant just one provision and leave the other blocked. They may be waiting for a different case to come to the court. Or, one or more justices could be writing a dissent or a concurrence from a draft order. In the coming weeks and months, each move by the Roberts court, particularly the votes of the chief and the newest justice, Kavanaugh will be scrutinized as the country moves to the next election. Not only did President Donald Trump vow to change the landscape of the judiciary before the last election \u2013 impacting the Supreme Court and lower courts across the country, but he also has promised to appoint \u201cpro-life\u201d judges. There are laws that take a head-on approach targeting Roe, and others that seek to chip away at the court\u2019s precedents on abortion rights. \u201cWhile some laws set up a direct challenge to Roe by imposing a ban on abortions, it\u2019s also important to keep our eyes on the more stealth ways that states are trying to make abortion as good as illegal for thousands of women,\u201d said Jennifer Davlen, the Director of the Reproductive Freedom Project at the ACLU, who is behind the challenge to the Indiana law. Susan Collins defends her Brett Kavanaugh vote after he dissents in abortion access case She said the ACLU has also gone to Kentucky to stop the state from shutting down the last clinic there. Last week, Phil Bryant, the Republican governor of Mississippi signed a bill that would ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected \u2013 typically around six weeks of pregnancy. In an address before signing the bill, he said he could remember the \u201cexciting moments\u201d for both his children and grandchildren when the first sonograms were taken and a heartbeat could be heard. On Thursday, the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a challenge to that law in court. Three other states, Kentucky, Iowa and North Dakota, have tried to pass similar laws. Indiana\u2019s law has two provisions. One requires that fetal remains be disposed of the same way as other human remains (i.e. burial and cremation). Critics say it is meant to stigmatize or intimidate a woman who is choosing abortion. A separate provision says that the state can prohibit abortion that is solely motivated by the race, sex, or disability of the fetus. This provision goes to the core of Supreme Court precedent. Judge rules against North Carolina's 20-week abortion ban A panel of judges of the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals blocked both provisions. It held that the \u201cfetal disposition\u201d provision must fall because it has \u201cno rational relationship to a legitimate state interest,\u201d and that the so called \u201cnon-discrimination provision\u201d violates \u201cwell-established Supreme Court precedent holding that a woman may terminate her pregnancy prior to viability, and that the State may not prohibit a woman from exercising that right for any reason.\u201d RELATED: Indiana abortion law signed by Mike Pence ruled unconstitutional Indiana is asking the Supreme Court to take up the case and revive the law. In court papers, state Attorney General Curtis Hill Jr. argued that the so-called \u201cfetal disposition\u201d provision \u201cexpands on long-established legal and cultural traditions of recognizing the dignity and humanity of the fetus.\u201d And he said the state was within its rights to \u201cprevent prenatal discrimination on the basis of race, sex and disability.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A new biography of the first woman on the Supreme Court details Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s agonizing struggle with her husband\u2019s dementia in the years before she retired and her later angst as she watched the court lunge rightward and faced her own declining health. Veteran author Evan Thomas captures in \u201cFirst,\u201d released Tuesday, the woman who lived much of her life in the spotlight yet who, in the quiet of her home, struggled with common health difficulties and the vicissitudes of age. He writes that O\u2019Connor, who will be 89 on March 26 and has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, generally declined to discuss cases and her approach to the law. But he adds details to familiar court dramas such as Bush v. Gore, the Florida election dispute that culminated the presidential election in 2000. The 5-to-4, conservative-versus-liberal decision, with O\u2019Connor in the majority, ensured the end of recounts and secured Republican George W. Bush\u2019s victory over Democrat Al Gore. Thomas writes that O\u2019Connor took the lead to craft its legal grounds and inserted a key line in the unsigned opinion limiting it \u201cto the present circumstances\u201d or, as Thomas characterizes it, \u201ca one-time ticket to get out of a jam.\u201d \u201cAsked if she had any regrets about Bush v. Gore, as she sat in a wheelchair at her assisted living facility,\u201d Thomas recounts of a January 2017 exchange, \u201cshe answered, \u2018I\u2019m sure I did, but second thoughts don\u2019t do you a lot of good. It looked like a party-line vote, I know.\u2019 Her craggy face softened and grew sad.\u201d Thomas also writes that retired Justice John Paul Stevens told him O\u2019Connor regretted stepping down when she did, in January 2006, and Stevens added, \u201cThe Court has never been this far to the right.\u201d When President Ronald Reagan appointed O\u2019Connor in 1981, the Arizona state court judge, then 51, offered a fresh image of female achievement. She had a compelling personal story and exuded a superwoman persona: the child of a pioneering ranch family in Arizona, she graduated from high school at age 16 and attended Stanford University; then after law school, when male-run law firms rejected her, she set up her own office; she became a state senator then a trial and appeals court judge, all while raising three boys and engaging in vigorous social and sporting life with husband John. Her competitiveness \u2013 in everything \u2013 became legendary. On the Supreme Court from September 1981 to January 2006, O\u2019Connor became a crucial swing vote, steadying the bench and influencing the law from abortion rights and affirmative action, to criminal due process and checks on the Bush administration\u2019s post-September 11, 2001 war on terrorism. Her home life was more complicated in the late 1990s when John first showed signs of his Alzheimer\u2019s. In the early 2000s, she feared leaving him alone at home and brought him to her chambers at the court. She had met John when they were students together at Stanford law school, and he gave up a thriving law practice in Phoenix to move to Washington in 1981. It was a difficult role, O\u2019Connor acknowledged to Thomas, saying in January 2017, \u201cbeing the husband of me was not an easy job.\u201d Social events became awkward as John\u2019s condition worsened. \u201cAt a dinner party, Sandra had to stop him from eating a stick of butter, which he had mistaken for cheese,\u201d writes Thomas. At another meal with a friend, in 2004, as they watched John just seated, staring, Thomas writes, O\u2019Connor nodded toward John and quietly told her friend, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to step down.\u201d By the fall of 2004, another factor was in the mix: Chief Justice William Rehnquist was suffering from thyroid cancer. O\u2019Connor and Rehnquist knew that two justices should not leave at the same time and aggravate the already politicized confirmation process. As the annual court session was ending in June 2005, Rehnquist told O\u2019Connor he believed he could last another year. That prompted her to seal her retirement decision to retire and she revealed it in a letter to Bush on July 1. But then Rehnquist died, on September 3. Thomas writes that O\u2019Connor had lingering concerns about her interactions with Rehnquist. \u201cAccording to two friends who knew her well,\u201d the author writes, \u201cshe was bothered by a troubling thought: In their tortured conversations about who should go first, had the chief justice been fully honest with her? He had not told her the severity of his disease; she did not know that his doctors had given him no more than a year to live when he was diagnosed in October 2004.\u201d Justice Stevens, who retired in 2010 at age 90, told Thomas, \u201cShe expressed regret to me. She wished she had it to do all over again. \u2026 She was too deferential to Bill [Rehnquist]. She should have stayed on.\u201d Former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor O\u2019Connor and Rehnquist had been friends since their Stanford law days, when they dated. Thomas had last October made public a letter he found among O\u2019Connor\u2019s papers of Rehnquist proposing marriage to the young Sandra. She turned him down, and Thomas writes in his book that when O\u2019Connor later revealed her relationship with John to Rehnquist in a special delivery letter, he responded: \u201cSandy, you are 22 years of age, and it is about time you realized that you\u2019ve got to put some rein on your impulses as a gesture of decency.\u201d Rehnquist and O\u2019Connor were able to resume their friendship, and in time their respective families socialized together in Phoenix and in Washington. Thomas details O\u2019Connor\u2019s criticism of the current Supreme Court, her disappointment in the 2010 Citizens United ruling, for example, that lifted regulations on corporate and labor union election contributions, and unhappiness with Justice Samuel Alito, her far more conservative successor who voted to reverse some of her moderate rulings. \u201cShe was cross about her successor,\u201d Thomas writes and decried \u201cthe Court\u2019s lurch to the right after her departure.\u201d In October 2018, O\u2019Connor\u2019s family released a letter that revealed her Alzheimer\u2019s. Thomas documents in his book signs of related memory and behavior issues beginning about five years earlier. One of the final anecdotes in the book occurred after O\u2019Connor had been retired for nearly five years. The setting was the annual Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington, a year after husband John\u2019s 2009 death, with President Barack Obama in attendance. It was vintage O\u2019Connor. \u201cToasting John again the year after he died, she brought down the house of movers and shakers by ending her talk with one of his favorite quips: \u2018As my dear husband John used to say, you don\u2019t have to drink to have fun. But why take a chance?\u2019 Coming to the podium after her, a still laughing President Obama asked, \u2018Who does not love this woman?\u2019 The crowd stood and roared.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The only thing worse than the near extinction of press briefings in the Trump White House might be actually having a briefing. In her first appearance behind her iconic podium in 42 days, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Monday did nothing to answer questions boiling up about President Donald Trump, the administration and associated scandals during her long absence. But Sanders was more than happy to use reporters\u2019 questions to spread the latest toxin injected into Washington\u2019s political bloodstream by the President \u2013 the ideas that Democrats want to kill babies and they hate Jews. Pressed for answers in her first briefing since Trump\u2019s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s blockbuster testimony on Capitol Hill, Sanders deflected on explosive new details about Trump\u2019s hush money payments to women before the 2016 election. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of those specific, uh, checks,\u201d Sanders said. Sarah Sanders deflects when asked about Trump calling Democrats 'anti-Jewish' She also couldn\u2019t say when the President will install a permanent defense secretary \u2013 at a time when the US remains at war across the globe. \u201cWhen the President\u2019s ready to make an announcement on that front, he certainly will,\u201d said Sanders, who was preceded at the podium by Acting Budget Director Russell Vought. She dodged answering about claims Trump had tried to use the Justice Department to block the AT&T merger with Time Warner, the parent company of CNN \u2013 a possible abuse of power. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any conversations around that matter,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. But she quickly took the chance to reignite controversy over Trump\u2019s comment last week that Democrats are an \u201canti-Jewish party\u201d following remarks critical of Israel\u2019s American supporters by Muslim Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. \u201cFrankly, I think you should ask Democrats what their position is,\u201d Sanders said, seizing on a chance to deepen divides between the Democratic leadership and a Washington neophyte who was chastised by her party bosses. \u201cI think that the real shame in all of this is that Democrats are perfectly capable in coming together and agreeing on the fact that they\u2019re comfortable ripping babies straight from a mother\u2019s womb or killing a baby after birth,\u201d Sanders said, hitting another issue \u2013 abortion \u2013 that resonates with Trump\u2019s conservative base. Monday\u2019s contentious briefing was the latest sign of how the White House, lacking the cushion of a Republican majority in the House, is already initiating an all-out assault designed to present Democrats as radical and extreme and unfit to oust Trump in 2020. Even from the once-dignified surroundings of the White House Briefing Room, the President is willing to send out his subordinates to obfuscate and stir up the outrage that seems to be his natural political habitat. But in a broader sense, Monday\u2019s theatrics reflected a wider truth about the Trump administration: its allergy to scrutiny and willingness to just refuse to address scandals any one of which might have proved fatal to previous presidencies. Sanders is far from the first White House press secretary to take political swipes from the podium \u2013 Ari Fleischer and Robert Gibbs in recent years were particularly astute partisan tacticians for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, respectively. But even in contentious exchanges between those two ex-campaign operatives and reporters, there was a sense that an important exercise in democracy and accountability was playing out in which those in power had at least to answer for their actions. White House press secretaries are public servants and are paid by taxpayers. Most have at least sought to give the impression that they are a conduit between the press and the American people and the President \u2013 even if that\u2019s a custom more honored in the breach than the observance. There is little such sense in this administration \u2013 partly because briefings have become so rare \u2013 and because this White House seems to scoff at the belief it should even pretend it is opening up for scrutiny. Briefings by Sanders are scarce, sharp and short, and reverberate with barely disguised ill feeling between reporters and the administration of a President who has branded journalists \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d The fact that Sanders has to answer to Trump\u2019s daily venom, which would be seen as unpresidential in any other administration but has dulled public outrage with its volume, means she has one of the toughest jobs in Washington. But there is no denying she is good at that job, which requires unshakable loyalty to her boss and the adoption of his abrasive political methods even at the risk of her own reputation outside the conservative media world. Ex-Fox News executive Bill Shine out at the White House Sanders\u2019 own whip-smart political instincts and tendency to visibly infuriate reporters with her brassiness and non-answers during the briefings play into the administration\u2019s contention that it is the victim of an orchestrated campaign of unfair press coverage. Her televised theatrics are one reason why she has become a hugely popular figure on the right and why her Twitter mentions pulsate with love from Trump supporters. It\u2019s not clear whether Monday was a one-off or Sanders is committing to a regular briefing schedule. She rightly pointed out that the President himself often takes questions from reporters \u2013 although his freewheeling sessions spare him from the formal structure with follow-up questions by successive journalists, which offers the best chance to hold power to account. Sanders\u2019 attacks on Democrats on Monday prove that she\u2019s assimilated Trump\u2019s characteristic tactic of stoking anger and new controversies to deflect from his own political liabilities. With the media now apparently condemned to unpick the President\u2019s claims about Democrats and Jewish people, the focus is not on Friday\u2019s lame monthly job numbers, or Wednesday\u2019s sentencing of Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, or the President\u2019s apparently unraveling North Korea diplomacy. In this administration, treating the press with scorn is what sells \u2013 after all, soon after Sanders left the briefing room on Monday, Trump sent out a political appeal claiming that the \u201cmainstream media have never been more dishonest than they are today.\u201d Baiting reporters is popular with Trump voters who prefer their news from conservative outlets and are willing to accept his advice that they should rely on him and not the media for facts. It\u2019s also the reflection of a choice made long ago by Trump to anchor his presidency on the fervent faith of a political base that is short of a majority of voters but has helped him effectively seize control of the Republican Party and retain the support of most of its voters. Monday\u2019s briefing took place after Democrats complained about the tone of public remarks by Trump in which he said that the \u201cDemocrats have become an anti-Israel party. They\u2019ve become an anti-Jewish party, and that\u2019s too bad.\u201d It was an incendiary claim to make about a party whose recent presidents, including Obama and Bill Clinton, have expressed reverence for Israel, and whose leaders in Congress, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have long records of support for the predominantly Jewish state. According to exit polls, 79% of Jewish voters supported Democratic candidates in the midterm elections in November. Meanwhile, Trump, whose daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are devout Jews, was accused of fomenting anti-Semitism himself with a closing 2016 campaign ad that featured images of prominent Jewish figures such as George Soros, then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and financier Lloyd Blankfein along with a warning of the threat from \u201cglobal special interests.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Fresh off an unsuccessful summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, President Donald Trump jetted back from Vietnam just in time to appear at the annual CPAC conference. And appear he did! Egged on by the red-meat crowd, Trump went on and on (and on) \u2013 rarely staying on script in a speech that amounted to a sort-of greatest hits double album. I went through the whole damn transcript \u2013 and it was a doozy. The lines you need to see are below. 1. [Trump comes out on stage, claps, and then bear-hugs an American flag] And away we go! 2. \u201cWhat we did in 2016 \u2013 the Election, we call it, with a capital \u2018E\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s never been done before.\u201d Donald Trump, grammar expert. Also, copy editor. Also also, history-maker. 3. \u201cI was probably more of a conservative than a Republican. People just didn\u2019t quite understand that. They didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d They likely didn\u2019t understand it because Trump, prior to running for president as a Republican, had expressed any number of views \u2013 on abortion, same-sex marriage and lots else \u2013 that suggested he was more closely aligned with Democrats than the GOP. 4. \u201cHow many times did you hear, for months and months, \u2018There is no way to 270?\u2019 You know what that means, right? \u2018There is no way to 270.\u2019\u201d The 2016 election ended 846 days ago. 5. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to do even better in 2020. I think we\u2019re going to do numbers that people haven\u2019t seen for a long time.\u201d \u201cNumbers.\u201d 6. \u201cBut I found some very old laws from when our country was rich \u2013 really rich. The old tariff laws \u2013 we had to dust them off; you could hardly see, they were so dusty.\u201d Ah, those rich \u2013 and dusty \u2013 days. Man, they were great. Tough on the allergies. But great. 7. \u201cYou know I\u2019m totally off-script, right?\u201d Oh, yes. 8. \u201cYou know I\u2019m totally off-script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off-script. True.\u201d It IS true. Voters seemed to believe that Trump\u2019s often rambling, hard-to-understand speeches were evidence that he was an authentic politician who refused to be stage-managed. And they liked the idea of a guy who just, well, says stuff. 9. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t go off-script, our country is in big trouble, folks.\u201d So going off-script is the key to future successes \u2026 [sharpens pencil, breaks out new sheet of paper, begins calculations] 10. \u201cWhen the wind stops blowing, that\u2019s the end of your electric. Let\u2019s hurry up. \u2018Darling\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Darling, is the wind blowing today? I\u2019d like to watch television, darling.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhen the wind stop blowing, that\u2019s the end of your electric.\u201d \u2013 The President of the United States. (Also, Trump is talking here about his sarcastic \u201csupport\u201d for the \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d) 11. \u201cSo the Great Tariff Debate of 1888 \u2013 and then we had so much money we could do whatever we wanted.\u201d Trump has taken to citing 1888 in his speeches of late. This will stun you, but his reading of the historical facts misses a few things. 12. \u201cI won\u2019t use a certain words because it\u2019s not politically \u2013 but everybody knows the word I\u2019d love to use. Should I use it? I won\u2019t do it.\u201d Trump has even turned his infamous love for cursing into some sort of anti-elites mantra. Amazing. 13. \u201cIf you tell a joke, if you\u2019re sarcastic, if you\u2019re having fun with the audience, if you\u2019re on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, \u2018Russia, please, if you can, get us Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Please, Russia, please.\u2019\u201d HA HA HA \u2026 oh wait, on the same day Trump \u201cjokingly\u201d asked the Russians to get Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails, the Russians began a cybercampaign to get Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. 14. \u201cSo everybody is having a good time. I\u2019m laughing, we\u2019re all having fun.\u201d \u201cI really can\u2019t say I guess I laugh to keep from crying.\u201d \u2013 Q-Tip 15. \u201cI know there are people in the Republican Party and people \u2013 really, even conservatives \u2013 good conservatives \u2013 they don\u2019t like tariffs. I\u2019m not liking or not liking.\u201d Here\u2019s the President on tariffs: \u201cI\u2019m not liking or not liking.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 16. \u201cSo they don\u2019t have anything with Russia. There\u2019s no collusion.\u201d Here\u2019s a few numbers on the ongoing special counsel probe into Russian interference: 199 criminal charges have been brought against 37 people and entities, seven people have pleaded guilty while four have been sentenced to prison. 17. \u201cI saw little Shifty Schiff yesterday.\u201d \u201cLittle Adam Schitt\u201d grimaces. 18. \u201cSo now we\u2019re waiting for a report, and we\u2019ll find out whether or not, and who we\u2019re dealing with. We\u2019re waiting for a report by people that weren\u2019t elected.\u201d A terrific window into how much Trump has made the special counsel\u2019s report about him. Remember that special counsel Robert Mueller was asked to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the possibility that members of Trump\u2019s team may have colluded with the Russians. Instead of worrying about what it means that a malicious foreign power sought to influence our election, Trump is entirely focused on what the report \u2013 and its findings \u2013 mean for him. 19. \u201cWe had \u2013 think of this: We had the greatest election \u2013 in all fairness, I used to hear Andrew Jackson. This was now greater than the election of Andrew Jackson. People say that. No, people say it. I\u2019m not saying it. Right? This was the equivalent or greater.\u201d Well if \u201cpeople say that,\u201d who am I to argue???? 20. \u201cThose red hats \u2013 and white ones. The key is in the color. The key is what it says. \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 is what it says. Right? Right?\u201d Wait. So is the key the color of the hats or what they say on them? I NEED TO KNOW. 21. \u201cAnd unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn\u2019t be there. And, all of a sudden, they\u2019re trying to take you out with bullshit. OK? With bullshit.\u201d I assume Trump is referring to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia probe. Or maybe former FBI Director James Comey for launching the probe. Or deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for forming a special counsel to look into it. Maybe all of the above. Either way: It\u2019s total bullshit! 22. \u201cNow, Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person that appointed him. And as you know, the attorney general says, \u2018I\u2019m going to recuse myself.\u2019\u201d Mueller and Rosenstein never received votes because they are career Justice Department officials. Mueller was a registered Republican, while Rosenstein was a Trump appointee. So \u2026 23. \u201cYou take a look at them. One of them was involved with the Hillary Clinton Foundation, running it. Another one has perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I\u2019ve ever seen. All killers.\u201d First, a fact check. No one on Mueller\u2019s team ran the Clinton Foundation. Jeannie Rhee was outside counsel to the foundation but never worked there on the payroll. Not sure which member of Mueller\u2019s teams \u201chas perhaps the worst reputation of any human being I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d but I know at least one person who could challenge them for their title \u2026 And, no, no one of Mueller\u2019s team is a convicted murderer or \u201ckiller.\u201d 24. \u201cI had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, \u2018why isn\u2019t that mentioned?\u2019\u201d Trump is referring to an episode in 2011 when Mueller left a Trump golf club because, according to Trump, of a dispute over dues. Mueller says there was no such dispute. And yet, it is mentioned. Regularly. 25. \u201cHe wanted the job as FBI Director.\u201d It is true that Trump interviewed Mueller to be FBI director \u2013 a job he held for a decade under Presidents Bush and Obama \u2013 on the day before Mueller was named special counsel. It is not clear if Mueller expressed a desire to be the FBI director in those conversations. 26. \u201cI have one of the great inventions in history. It\u2019s called TiVo. I think it\u2019s actually better than television, because television is practically useless without TiVo, right?\u201d \u201cI invented the piano key necktie. I invented it!\u201d \u2013 Jacobim Mugatu 27. \u201cAnd I fire a bad cop. I fire a dirty cop.\u201d Trump is referring here to Comey, a career Justice Department official. Not to that cop in \u201cThe Wire\u201d who was always taking money off of the street hustlers and keeping it form himself. (I see you, Randy!) 28. \u201cSo, just to finish \u2013 and I\u2019ll tell you, Matt Schlapp is loving this.\u201d He\u2019s not even halfway done. 29. \u201cNumber one, I\u2019m in love, and you\u2019re in love. We\u2019re all in love together.\u201d Trump is talking about why he is speaking for so long and so far off-script. It\u2019s because of love, obviously. 30. \u201cThere\u2019s so much love in this room, it\u2019s easy to talk. You can talk your heart out. You really could. There\u2019s love in this room. You can talk your heart out. It\u2019s easy. It\u2019s easy. It\u2019s easy.\u201d What do you say to a man who has already said everything? 31. \u201cWe never had an empty seat.\u201d Trump is claiming there was never an empty seat at ANY rally he held in 2018. Which, uh, isn\u2019t accurate. 32. \u201cAnd from the day we came down the escalator, I really don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had an empty seat at any arena, at any stadium.\u201d \u201cThe day we came down the escalator.\u201d 33. \u201cThey did the same thing at our big inauguration speech. You take a look at those crowds.\u201d Trump\u2019s claims that more people attended or watched his inauguration than any other in history has been repeatedly \u2013 and clearly \u2013 debunked. And yet, here we are. 34. \u201cRemember this also \u2013 not that Obama would ever do this: But we had fencing all the way down to the Washington Monument. And it was raining and it was wet, and the grass was wet.\u201d He\u2019s STILL making excuses for why the crowd at his inauguration didn\u2019t look bigger. The grass was wet! The fencing! The sun was in my eyes! 35. \u201cWe had a crowd \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. And I have to live \u2013 I have to live with \u2018crowd size.\u2019 It\u2019s all a phony deal.\u201d This is actually a good illustration of how Trump\u2019s world works. From where he was giving his inaugural address, he saw lots and lots of people. Therefore, it must have been the most ever \u2013 even if objective facts don\u2019t bear that out. Those objective facts, in his mind, are just part of the fake news media\u2019s attempts to smear him. 36. \u201cBut I saw a picture just the other night of practically no people. It was taken hours before our great day.\u201d Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. That was 773 days ago. But \u201cjust the other night\u201d he was looking at a picture of his inauguration crowd. Totally normal stuff here! 37. \u201cThen I\u2019ll show you where they showed, just the other day, an empty field \u2013 like nobody on it. And you\u2019ll see the sun. You know, you can see it\u2019s very dark, because the sun is like starting to rise, right?\u201d In which the President of the United States reveals he has been closely studying pictures of his inauguration crowd in search of evidence that they had been taken very early in the morning and, therefore, missed the big crowds. Sure! 38. \u201cYou know, somebody said, \u2018Oh, the speech you made, sir, the State of the Union speech was incredible.\u2019 They said it was incredible. They said that was so great.\u201d Who is this \u201csomebody\u201d? 39. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get it approved for a certain reason, because I thought somebody treated me very badly. Very badly. Don\u2019t get that vote very often. And I said, you know, I don\u2019t want to get it.\u201d Trump is making clear here that he is not happy that he helped get drilling in ANWR approved because Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) wanted it to happen and he didn\u2019t want her to get something she wanted. Because she doesn\u2019t vote with him enough. Totally fine! 40. \u201cBy the way, you know I\u2019m building the wall. We\u2019re finishing the wall. We got a lot of money. It\u2019s in the thing.\u201d It is, indeed, in the thing. 41. \u201cWe have people in Congress that hate our country.\u201d WOW WOW WOW. 42. \u201cWe have a lot of people here that are important people in terms of votes. We have some senators. We have some congressmen.\u201d Yes, waiter, I\u2019ll have the word salad. 43. \u201cFor one thing, they don\u2019t respect us. They think we\u2019re \u2018stupido.\u2019\u201d What were the odds in Vegas that Trump would say \u201cstupido\u201d? One in a million? Higher? Those oddsmakers were stupido. 44. \u201cHe called me up. He said, \u2018You\u2019re a great President. You\u2019re doing a great job.\u2019\u201d According to Trump, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) told him how great he was doing. I, uh, doubt this is true. 45. \u201cThe leaves \u2013 every once in a while, you have to remove the leaves because they are so \u2013 a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn\u2019t mean it.\u201d Donald Trump on forest fires. 46. \u201cHe said, \u2018I just want to tell you you\u2019re a great President and you\u2019re one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met.\u2019\u201d So, the liberal governor of California called up Trump to tell him how great he is and how smart he is? Riiiiiiiiiight. 47. \u201cBut I was told by a general, who I had to fire \u2013 I said, \u2018General, how long before we get 100% of the caliphate?\u2019 He said, \u2018Sir, two years.\u2019 I said, \u2018I can\u2019t take it two years.\u2019\u201d \u201cI know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump 48. \u201cI never saw so many beautiful-looking machine guns. I\u2019d look at that equipment and I\u2019d say, \u2018Man \u2026\u2019 They sit in the trees. They sit on the lawn.\u201d Words fail. 49. \u201cI have pretty good vision. At least for my age, I have good vision. I guess for my age, I have great vision.\u201d From good to great in two sentences: The life of Donald Trump. 50. \u201cSo we changed his name. Called him \u2018Mad Dog.\u2019 But it wasn\u2019t working too well. Mad Dog wasn\u2019t working too well.\u201d Contrary to this claim, Trump didn\u2019t invent the nickname \u201cMad Dog\u201d for his former Defense Secretary James Mattis. Not even close. 51. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Bring the cameras. I\u2019m going to make a movie. This is the most incredible thing.\u2019\u201d Trump was in Iraq to meet with generals. His first thought? Bring in the cameras. Let\u2019s make a movie. 52. \u201cI mean, you talk central casting. These guys \u2013 you couldn\u2019t \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s incredible. They had a master sergeant. I could take him right now, bring him to Hollywood, make a military movie, and he\u2019s the star of the movie.\u201d Trump reveals, on almost a daily basis, that he views being President as akin to serving as the executive producer for the world\u2019s greatest reality show. 53. \u201cThe drill sergeant was so incredible that he ended up starring in the movie, and he should have gotten the Academy Award, by the way, but he didn\u2019t. That\u2019s because Hollywood discriminates against our people. You know the movie I\u2019m talking about, right? What was that movie? You know the movie.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s called \u201cFull Metal Jacket.\u201d 54. \u201cNobody has left. I watch those doors. Because a lot of times \u2013 a lot of times \u2013 well, one time, the press said people left. Yeah, you know where they went? To the bathroom. And then they came back.\u201d This speech lasted TWO hours. TWO. 55. \u201cAnd a certain fake news deal showed a picture on the front page of these two empty seats. They said Trump had empty seats. We never have empty seats.\u201d Back to this then? Wasn\u2019t that sort of a first-hour-of-the-speech sort of thing? 56. \u201cSee, I don\u2019t have white hair. I don\u2019t have white hair.\u201d Um, true! 57. \u201cShe\u2019s like \u2013 she\u2019s like a crazed person. What she said about men is so bad. What she said about men is so bad.\u201d Donald Trump on Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). Perfectly normal! Nothing to see here folks! 58. \u201cWe reject oppressive speech codes, censorship, political correctness, and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas. These ideas are dangerous.\u201d If Trump said just these two sentences over and over and over again, he would probably get re-elected. Because this anti-PC rhetoric resonates with lots and lots of people who likely aren\u2019t obvious Trump supporters. Of course, as this speech proves, he will never just say these two sentences. Or any two sentences. 59. \u201cMothers, who love their daughters, give them massive amounts of birth control pills because they know their daughters are going to be raped on the way up to our southern border.\u201d I think this interview with a border patrol agent is where Trump got this idea. it\u2019s not at all clear if this was an isolated incident or a common practice. 60. \u201cNot my fault I inherited this mess, but we\u2019re fixing it.\u201d Trump is referring here specifically to the situation at the border. But really, he views every issue (and his whole life) through this lens. Someone else is responsible for the problem. But he will fix it. 61. \u201cI did 32 big, fat rallies. And those rallies brought us to a tremendous Senate victory so that we can continue onward with our judges and our approvals.\u201d So, Trump deserves credit for the 2018 election! 62. \u201cOne of the commentators \u2013 and I appreciate it \u2013 one of the shows where they were saying how I suffered a defeat, this commentator said, \u2018Excuse me, he didn\u2019t run.\u2019\u201d So Trump doesn\u2019t deserve blame for the 2018 election! (Also: These two sentences were uttered by the President within 20 seconds of each other. Good times.) 63. \u201cThen he had a tough race against the new star of the Democrat Party \u2013 not Democratic. It\u2019s Democrat. We have to do that.\u201d This is the dumbest thing ever. It is the \u201cDemocratic\u201d Party. Republicans in the 1990s decided that they would start saying it was the \u201cDemocrat\u201d Party because they didn\u2019t want people to think only one party was on the side of democratic ideals. Smart move, Republics! 64. \u201cI hate to say in the speech, the \u2018Democrat Party\u2019 because it doesn\u2019t sound good. But that\u2019s all the more reason I use it, because it doesn\u2019t. They should change it because it sounds much better. Rhetorically, it\u2019s much better. Much better.\u201d They don\u2019t need to change it! It\u2019s already called the Democratic Party! Republicans just have to stop saying \u201cDemocrat\u201d Party. Come on people. We can do this! 65. \u201cWe had a rally at the airport, where 55,000 people showed up to the airport. It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back.\u201d The rally for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp was held in one hangar. Not two. And definitely not three. The MOST people who were there? Around 18,500. 66. \u201cFourth of July \u2013 keep it open. We want to bring millions of people into the city, and we want people to come who love our country. Those are the people we want. The Fourth of July. (Applause.) A salute to America.\u201d [checks calendar] I\u2019m WIDE open on July 4! 67. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m watching those doors. Not one person has left, and I\u2019ve been up here a long time. \u2026 But not one person. So if you hear tomorrow, when they read \u2018people left\u2019 \u2013 nobody left early. There hasn\u2019t been one person that\u2019s left.\u201d He is totally and completely obsessed with crowds. And crowds staying. And loving him. This feels like a good place to end.",

            "article_content": "(This is the eighth edition of our monthly power rankings of Democrats most likely to get their party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2020.) On Monday night in El Paso, Texas, we got a glimpse of what the future of the 2020 presidential race might look like. President Donald Trump bashed Democrats as the \u201cparty of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime\u201d in a red-meat rally that previewed where he\u2019s likely to head as he tries to win a second term. Trump also blasted the man who once represented El Paso in Congress as \u201ca young man who\u2019s got very little going for himself, except he\u2019s got a great first name.\u201d That \u201cyoung man\u201d \u2013 former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 was headlining a rally to protest Trump and his policies. \u201cWe are the example that the United States of America needs right now,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told the crowd. \u201cThis is where we make our stand!\u201d It was the clearest sign yet that the man who became a single-named national phenomenon in his ultimately unsuccessful 2018 campaign against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz was actually getting ready to run in 2020 \u2013 and that the current resident of the White House was paying very close attention. For 2020 Democrats not named \u201cBeto,\u201d Monday night\u2019s back and forth had to be a humbling affair. It made clear not only that O\u2019Rourke has star power and a grassroots backing that is the envy of the Democratic Party but that Trump himself is already elevating Beto with his attacks. Monday drove home a simple reality: If and when \u2013 and it feels more like a question of when than if at this point \u2013 O\u2019Rourke decides to get into the 2020 race, he will fundamentally alter the contest in ways big and small. O\u2019Rourke, possibly more than any other candidate \u2013 up to and including former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 will become the central mover of the contest. He will act, others will react. Below, our latest rankings of the 10 Democrats most likely to wind up as the party\u2019s nominee next fall. 10. Sherrod Brown: The case is easy to make for the senior senator from Ohio. Electability is key for Democratic voters in 2020, and Brown just won re-election by 7 points in a state Hillary Clinton lost by 8 points. Unlike other candidates, (see Biden, Joe), Brown likely won\u2019t have to go on apology tour for previously held conservative positions, given that he voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 and the Iraq War in 2002. So what is Brown\u2019s problem? There will be other candidates who can argue they\u2019re electable, and others who will say they\u2019re liberal. We\u2019re also just not sure the party will nominate a white man. Brown would, however, likely move up in our rankings if he decides to officially run. 9. Kirsten Gillibrand: The New York senator is still in the exploratory phase of the race although she is quite clearly running. Her early state visits to date have shined a light on how her record as a member of the House was considerably more conservative than she currently portrays herself. Explaining that delta is central to Gillibrand\u2019s ability to sell herself to voters. Right now, she is lagging a bit because she simply isn\u2019t as well known as some of the other candidates in the race. 8. Julian Castro: A big problem for a lot of 2020 contenders is making their resume stand out. That currently isn\u2019t a problem for Castro. He\u2019s never served in Congress, which you can\u2019t say for most other candidates in the race. Castro\u2019s the only Latino running (Latinos made up 18% of Democratic voters in 2018, according to Pew Research Center), and he has a good biography to boot. The most obvious problem for him: this field is full of bigwigs, so folks with minimal name recognition will have some difficulty standing out. Additionally, this race likely isn\u2019t big enough for two Texans, and O\u2019Rourke may steal Castro\u2019s thunder if he enters. 7. Amy Klobuchar: The optics of the Minnesota senator\u2019s formal announcement last weekend couldn\u2019t have been better \u2013 she touted her grit and toughness while something close to a blizzard went on all around her. Klobuchar\u2019s announcement was somewhat marred, however, by a series of stories that painted her as a very difficult boss (and that\u2019s being nice). Assuming she can find a way past those stories, Klobuchar\u2019s focus on her Midwestern roots should position her well to make a serious run in Iowa. 6. Bernie Sanders: Vermont\u2019s junior senator is second in the polls, and no candidate had a better ratio between his very favorable and somewhat favorable rating in our December Iowa poll (i.e. the people who like him really like him). That could matter in a field where a lot of candidates will likely be running. Like Brown, few can argue against the idea that Sanders was liberal before it was cool. It\u2019s not clear, however, that Sanders can pick up support beyond his base. He continues to poll well behind his 2016 primary showing despite having high name recognition. Sanders is an independent running in a Democratic Party with other actual Democrats who are also very liberal. Finally, many Clinton fans still have ill will toward him after 2016. 5. Cory Booker: The New Jersey senator is \u2013 with the possible exception of O\u2019Rourke \u2013 the most naturally gifted candidate in the field. Booker is a charismatic speaker and will undoubtedly light up rooms in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. The question is: what is Booker selling? His announcement in Newark earlier this month leaned heavily on his personal biography and his message of love and unity. Is that enough? 4. Elizabeth Warren: If you look at the polls, Warren is in second place among those who have declared their candidacy. The attacks from Trump on her lack of Native American heritage may actually work to Warren\u2019s benefit, if Democrats rally around her. In her perfect universe, Warren will rally those on the left, while also being reassuring to those in the establishment who are afraid of Sanders. Warren\u2019s flaws are fairly obvious: she may be too far left for Democrats who want a more moderate candidate, and her lackluster performances versus the average Democrat in her Senate runs may be a huge issue for voters who are prizing electability. 3. Beto O\u2019Rourke: It\u2019s hard to imagine this week going any better for Beto. Not only did he hold a large rally opposite Trump in El Paso but the commander-in-chief repeatedly went after him in the course of a 75-minute speech. It\u2019s hard not to see O\u2019Rourke running at this point but he is expected to make a final decision by the end of the month. Assuming he runs, the first few months of his campaign are critical; how much of the buzz and excitement that still clings to him \u2013 despite losing a Senate race in 2018 \u2013 can he translate into money, activists and poll numbers? 2. Joe Biden: There is perhaps no candidate who we are more unsure of than the former vice president. Biden leads in all the polling and matches up well with what factors voters say are important in determining their 2020 selection. Biden is also likely to pick up a slew of endorsements from election officials, which is usually correlated with success. Still, we wonder whether Biden\u2019s support would fall apart if he ran. Much of it may merely be goodwill leftover from when he was President Barack Obama\u2019s No. 2. Goodwill that may disappear when he is attacked over his fairly moderate record. We\u2019re also at least somewhat doubtful that a party base that despises the current President will nominate its own older white man to be Democrats\u2019 standard-bearer. 1. Kamala Harris: Nothing we\u2019ve seen since Harris entered the race officially last month has changed our mind about her hold on the spot in our rankings. Her week-long announcement milked every possible shred of positive press for her \u2013 and even impressed Trump! The biggest open question for the California senator is whether she can wait all the way until the South Carolina primary to win \u2013 or if she needs something sooner in Iowa or New Hampshire.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is, by all measures, going to have a very difficult time winning a second term next November. He lost the popular vote in 2016 by almost 3 million votes. He\u2019s a deeply polarizing figure whose job approval ratings have never crested 50% in his presidency to date. He could face a serious primary challenge. And yet, in the last two weeks, Democrats have handed Trump two issues on a golden platter \u2013 and it\u2019s already clear he is seizing on them. Bigly. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Consider: 1) In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law the Reproductive Health Act, which, among other things, takes the word \u201cabortion\u201d out of the state\u2019s criminal code, ensures that doctors and clinics who provide abortions can\u2019t be charged and codifies that abortions can be performed after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or the mother\u2019s health is at serious risk. Conservative critics \u2013 in New York and elsewhere \u2013 painted the law as overbroad and effectively legalizing abortion not only in the third trimester, but all the way to birth. Just as that was happening, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) went on a local radio station and tried to explain his support for legislation that would have loosened current strictures on late-term abortions in the commonwealth. Here\u2019s how Northam said (and yes, this came before the photo of him \u2013 or not \u2013 in blackface or KKK robes went viral): \u201c[Third trimester abortions are] done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s nonviable. So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d Republicans immediately reacted, insisting that Northam sounded like he was advocating for infanticide. Northam, a pediatric neurologist, insisted that what he was describing was only in instances of non-viable pregnancies or \u201csevere fetal abnormalities,\u201d but the damage was done. \u201cThis is going to lift up the whole pro-life movement like maybe it\u2019s never been lifted up before,\u201d Trump told the Daily Caller in an interview. \u201cThe pro-life movement is very much a 50-50, it\u2019s a very 50-50 issue, actually it\u2019s gained a point or two over the years. I think this will very much lift up the issue because people have never thought of it in those terms.\u201d Trump isn\u2019t wrong. While polls show considerable majority support for keeping abortion legal, people are far more divided when it comes to late-term abortions. Just 13% said abortion should be legal in the third trimester in a 2018 Gallup poll, while 60% wanted it legal in the first three months of a pregnancy in that same survey. 2) Last week, liberals in Congress \u2013 led by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey \u2013 introduced the much-talked-about \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2013 a package of legislation designed to address the economic and environmental threat posed by climate change. According to CNN\u2019s Lydia DePillis, the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d lays out: \u201cA 10-year \u2018economic mobilization\u2019 that would phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation\u2019s infrastructure while building whole new layers into the existing social safety net. \u2026 The 14-page resolution envisions a shift to 100% renewable and zero-emission energy sources, and calls for the creation of millions of new high-wage jobs to help wipe out poverty.\u201d While DePillis notes that Ocasio-Cortez and the other co-sponsors of the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d resist putting any sort of total cost to their plan, one estimate of a plan that resembles it by the conservative American Action Forum contends that there would be $1 trillion in additional regulatory burden \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t even factor in the cost of all the new investments. All you need to do is read a transcript of Trump\u2019s speech in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night \u2013 billed as the first campaign speech of his 2020 race since the 2018 election \u2013 to understand how much of an opportunity Trump thinks he was handed by Democrats on these two issues. Lucky for you, I did read the Trump transcript \u2013 so you don\u2019t have to! Trump, repeatedly, hammered at the \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t like their policy of taking away your car, of taking away your airplane flights, of, \u2018Let\u2019s hop a train to California,\u2019 of \u2026 \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to own cows anymore,\u2019\u201d he said. And: \u201cThey want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which, by the way, there\u2019s no such thing as $100 trillion. You have to spend $100 trillion. And remember this. No other country except us is going to do it. That\u2019s a little problem, too.\u201d He also went after Democrats on abortion. Democrats are in favor of \u201callowing children to be ripped from their mother\u2019s womb right up until the moment of birth,\u201d Trump said at one point. Talking about Northam in particular, Trump said: \u201cThe governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable, and then talk to the mother, and talk to the father, and then execute the baby. Execute the baby.\u201d Just in case you missed the point, Trump drilled it home this way: \u201cThey\u2019re becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime.\u201d Here\u2019s the thing: That line, if he keeps to it, could be very, very effective, politically speaking. Obviously, it over-simplifies both the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and what Democrats have said and done on abortion. (The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker says Trump is \u201cmisrepresenting the Green New Deal as the plan is currently written.\u201d) But politics is often won by the simple argument or the easier-to-remember summation. I can imagine the eventual Democratic nominee trying to explain that the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d represents a radical \u2013 and necessary \u2013 rethinking of our energy consumption habits and what they mean to the long-term health of the planet. And Trump responding by saying: \u201cHow am I going to get you to Hawaii? By train?\u201d (A line he used to poke at Sen. Mazie Hirono in Monday\u2019s speech.) And the debate audience erupting in laughter. For those of you \u2013 and I know you are out there \u2013 who respond to that hypothetical scenario by yelling \u201cIT\u2019S YOUR JOB TO FACT CHECK THAT,\u201d I would remind you of the 2016 campaign. And of the myriad fact checks that news organizations did on Trump. And how, for lots and lots of people who voted for him, the fact that he quite clearly lied, repeatedly, didn\u2019t matter at all. In fact, the idea that media fact checkers often said Trump didn\u2019t deal in actual facts made some decent chunk of people more likely to vote for him. Why? Because Trump effectively painted Hillary Clinton, the media and everyone else who didn\u2019t support him as uncaring elites. As the \u201cother\u201d \u2013 people who thought it was their right to tell the average person how to live their lives, even if those same people had zero clue about how average people lived. Sound familiar? It should. Because that exact strategy is what Trump is putting in place right now. He\u2019s painting a picture of Democrats as socialist baby-killers. Or in the words of Alvy Singer from \u201cAnnie Hall:\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we\u2019re leftwing, communist, Jewish, homosexual pornographers.\u201d At the root of this strategy is a concession: Trump knows he can\u2019t win if the 2020 election is any sort of referendum on him. A majority of Americans simply do not like him or think he is doing a good job. The one path for him to win is by painting his eventual Democratic opponent as not only deeply out of touch with the average American, but also more than willing to install a value system that makes the US look a whole lot like the less savory parts of Europe. Cynical? Mightily so. But also Trump\u2019s most plausible path to a second term. And one that Democrats are unwittingly aiding and abetting at the moment.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court moved gingerly on Tuesday, seeking to at least postpone some hot button issues like the future of  DACA, LGBT employment rights and abortion restrictions for now in order to keep the third branch of government as far away from the controversies currently embroiling the political branches as possible. But the newly solidified conservative majority, moved boldly in other areas, signaling the impact of the vote of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. For the first time since 2010, the court agreed to hear a major Second Amendment case \u2013something it had repeatedly declined to do before Kavanaugh took the bench. That case will be heard next term. In addition, over the objection of the four liberal members of the court, the justices agreed to allow the administration\u2019s ban on most transgender individuals from serving in the military to go into effect while the issue plays out in the lower court. And Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh signaled that they were troubled by an opinion written by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals that went against a high school football coach who was suspended in part because he knelt at the 50 yard line at the end of games and said a private prayer. Although for procedural reasons they thought the court was right to decline to take up the particular case, the conservatives said they thought the lower court\u2019s language was \u201ctroubling.\u201d \u201cWhat is perhaps most troubling about the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion is language that can be understood to mean that a coach\u2019s duty to serve as a good role model requires the coach to refrain from any manifestation of religious faith\u2014even when the coach is plainly not on duty,\u201d Alito wrote. Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 who cares about the institution of the court perhaps more than any other justice \u2013 has made it his mission to protect the integrity of the Court in spite of attacks from President Donald Trump. While it takes four justices to agree to hear a case, one justice can vote to have it moved to a future conference. In the case of DACA, for instance, the court\u2019s inaction virtually guarantees that the Obama-era program will remain in effect for the next several months protecting some 700,000 immigrants currently enrolled in the program. But supporters of LGBT rights were dismayed at the court\u2019s actions. While the justices denied a request to hear the Trump administration\u2019s appeal to lower courts that have blocked his ban on most transgender individuals serving in the military, the justices did allow the policy to go into effect for now while the issue plays out below. Peter Renn, a lawyer for Lambda Legal, said in a statement that the court\u2019s move means now the \u201crug has been ripped out from under them.\u201d \u201cAlthough it\u2019s easy to understand why the Court wants to keep its head down with regard to so many of these high-profile, headline-generating, socially divisive cases, there could be an unintentional irony in moving so slowly,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cIf all that happens is that these disputes get pushed into the Court\u2019s next Term, that would mean decisions in those cases would be expected in mid-2020 \u2013 right in the middle of the next election cycle,\u201d he said.",

He also is an adjunct assistant professor at St. John\u2019s University in Queens, New York. Follow him on Twitter: @JamesAGagliano. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. With a highly anticipated pre-holiday release, Clint Eastwood\u2019s latest directorial turn, \u201cRichard Jewell,\u201d hasn\u2019t exactly turned out to be a commercial box-office success. But the staunchly conservative director \u2013 an outlier in Hollywood \u2013 has earned some deserved Oscar buzz for his depiction of a wholly flawed investigation, possibly beset by confirmation bias, brought by the FBI against the titular subject, 1996 Atlanta Olympics security guard Richard Jewell. While some critics have showered effusive praise on Eastwood\u2019s treatment of the subject, others have criticized his poetic license \u2013 including a less-than-glamorous portrayal of respected Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs as a do-anything-to-get-the-scoop journalist. Eastwood\u2019s depiction of Scruggs, who died in 2001 at 42, has led some press colleagues to decry the movie as one seeking to \u201cdistort the facts or invent them to amp up the drama.\u201d Unfortunately, the facts in the Centennial Park bombing case (CENTBOM) that Eastwood elects to spotlight don\u2019t exactly exonerate the FBI\u2019s rush to judgment in the 1996 terror bombing case. The movie and my attendant reflection on this period of FBI actions during CENTBOM remind me that past is prologue and we never really learn from mistakes. The Jewell case is a picture-perfect example of a most pernicious investigation foible: confirmation bias. A type of cognitive bias, confirmation bias is considered a systematic error of inductive reasoning. At its most destructive, when applied in law enforcement investigations, it misinterprets information in a manner that affirms preconceived notions. The focus on Jewell as the Centennial Park bomber in 1996 was confirmation bias on steroids. In the summer of 1996, I was a young FBI SWAT agent assigned to the Bureau\u2019s Brooklyn-Queens metropolitan New York City resident agency. Dispatched to my hometown, Atlanta, with fellow agents that July, I delighted in returning to the proud city I loved in order to serve as federal law enforcement response to any terrorist threat to the Games. The FBI's darkest days may lie ahead Jewell was assigned to Centennial Park during the week of Olympic evening performances by stars and celebrities. Jewell, portrayed by the brilliant Paul Walter Hauser in Eastwood\u2019s film, was the epitome of the cop-wannabe; a former sheriff\u2019s deputy and failed campus police officer who desperately sought to find a place within the law enforcement profession. The opportunity to serve as a security guard during the Atlanta Games was an attractive lure. Early Sunday morning on July 27th, shortly after I had completed my 2-10 p.m. shift at Atlanta Police Department headquarters, I was relaxing in Buckhead, a neighborhood in Atlanta. I was with fellow cops and FBI SWAT teammates at an Irish bar when our revelry was abruptly interrupted. It was just after 1:30 a.m., and my FBI-issued handheld radio crackled, blasting out an alert: \u201cAll FBI tactical response personnel are directed to return to base and prepare for deployment to crime scene. There has been an explosion at Centennial Park. Initial reports indicate an intentional bombing. Appears to be a terror attack. Return to base ASAP.\u201d We\u2019d soon learn a 40-pound pipe bomb had exploded, killing two and wounding 111 others. News reports identified Alice S. Hawthorne, 44, of Albany, Georgia, as being murdered in the attack, and a Turkish television crewman had a heart attack racing to the scene. President Clinton, in attendance for part of the Games, denounced the bombing as \u201can evil act of terror.\u201d Trump's tweets and IG report make life tough for FBI boss Jewell, who had discovered the bomb in a backpack and helped clear the area and had been considered a hero at first, was named as a suspect in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shortly thereafter. Absolutely no one could have predicted that he soon would become the FBI\u2019s prime suspect. After returning to my duty station in New York in mid-August, I followed the details of the investigation through the media like everyone else. I empathized with my Atlanta-based FBI brothers and sisters charged with bringing the bomber to justice. Like everyone else, I consumed breathless reporting about Richard Jewell, first identified as the hapless, slow-witted security guard with pronounced Southern drawl, and now a suspect \u2013 and public enemy No. 1. No doubt the obvious lead for the investigation was the guy who appeared too eager to begrudgingly serve as a hero. Jewell also lived with his mother and owned a number of weapons. Could he have pulled off the bombing while positioning himself as hyper-vigilant security officer who ultimately saved countless lives? The FBI theorized this and applied considerable resources to prove it. Were other leads ignored in the rush to judgment? Months later, after Jewell\u2019s life had been summarily upended, the FBI was forced to acknowledge that Jewell wasn\u2019t in fact the Centennial Park bomber. Instead, a far right-wing extremist and anti-abortion, anti-gay terrorist named Eric Rudolph was identified as the real culprit in the Centennial Park bombing. Trump's case against the FBI is disproved The acknowledgment was too little, too late. Jewell never recovered from the FBI\u2019s leaked investigation. Though he settled with various news outlets that reported the story, including CNN, Jewell was unable to fully repair his smeared image, irreparably tarnished by the FBI\u2019s leaked investigation and the concomitant reporting of same. He died from a heart attack in 2007. Two years after the Atlanta Olympics, I was assigned to the FBI\u2019s elite Hostage Rescue Team and deployed to Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina as part of a manhunt for Rudolph. He was ultimately captured near there in 2003 and subsequently confessed to the Centennial Park bombing. I criticize FBI actions reluctantly. I spent 25 years in the FBI investigative trenches and realize, implicitly, how 20/20 hindsight and second-guessing can be decidedly lazy and unfair. But the Jewell case should have been a cautionary tale. It wasn\u2019t. Notably, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks when the FBI opened a case into a series of mailed letters containing anthrax spores, the agency\u2019s investigation zeroed in on the wrong man. 'Richard Jewell' film under fire for depiction of journalist Kathy Scruggs And now, with the recent release of the IG investigation into the origins of Crossfire Hurricane \u2013 the FBI case into whether Trump campaign officials coordinated with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election \u2013 it may be fair to acknowledge that confirmation bias among FBI headquarters officials may have played some role in the underpinnings of the highly scrutinized and justifiably criticized investigation. When applying for FISA warrant renewals to continue to surveil Carter Page, FBI agents, the IG report found, used shortcuts and omitted information that Page had worked with the CIA in order to shield it from judges charged with approving the effort. \u201c[T]he surveillance of Carter Page continued even as the FBI gathered information that weakened the assessment of probable cause,\u201d the report notes.  It seems some at the FBI had made up their minds already to continue to investigate Page, despite having new evidence on his behalf. In response to the IG\u2019s findings, FBI Director Christopher Wray directed his agency to comply with a number of corrective actions, including overhauling its surveillance warrant process. The misdirected pursuit of Richard Jewell in 1996 should have served as a bellwether of change in how the FBI conducted sensitive investigations. Yet it may simply highlight how stubbornly resistant to change our bedrock institutions remain.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Robert Alexander is a professor of political science at Ohio Northern University and the author of \u201cRepresentation and the Electoral College.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @onuprof. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. The clock is ticking on Cory Booker\u2019s candidacy. He is barely registering in most polls and is struggling to make the December 19th debate stage for the Democratic primary because of it.\u200b Despite meeting the donor threshold to qualify, he has yet to register at least 4 percent in four early-state or national polls or 6 percent in two early-state polls. For his part, Booker has criticized these rules, arguing that voters, not the DNC, should be making decisions in the race. He has particularly taken issue with the enormous sums of money spent by billionaires Tom Steyer and Mike Bloomberg, which has helped them gain name recognition, and he has also noted that for all the party\u2019s diversity, Andrew Yang may be the only person of color to appear on the December debate stage. Booker\u2019s failure to gain traction has vexed many observers as he was once seen as a top-tier candidate. A year ago, CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza and Harry Enten ranked him as more likely to be the nominee than Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and a then unknown Pete Buttigieg. It appears that Booker\u2019s problem is that he is well-liked by Democrats across the ideological spectrum, but few love him. This is ironic given his focus on the power of love. Given the unusually large field, it is likely that his support has been divided among multiple candidates in the top tier.  Booker\u2019s supporters include those on the left as well as those who are more moderate. This reflects both his policy prescriptions and his temperament. Residing between multiple camps gives Booker broad appeal, but it has made it difficult for him to gain the deep appeal he needs. Cory Booker's secret weapon Political scientist and former John McCain campaign staffer Dan Schnur makes the case that Harris was a casualty between two camps: the adjusters \u2013 Biden and Buttigieg \u2013 looking to return to the incremental change of the Obama era, and the revolutionaries \u2013 Sanders and Warren \u2013 who want sweeping change. Schnur places Booker among the adjuster crowd, but doing so does not adequately reflect his positions. While it is true that Booker may be a political pragmatist, his policy stances more align with the likes of Warren and Sanders. Booker has liberal views on abortion, LGBTQ rights, climate change, electoral reform, gun control, and criminal justice reform. On most issues, he is to the left of Biden and more in line with Warren and Sanders. Booker\u2019s movement between both camps is best demonstrated in regard to health care policy. Booker was a co-sponsor with Bernie Sanders on the Medicare for All Act, which would have eliminated private insurance in favor of universal healthcare, yet, he has also indicated that, if elected, he would take an approach more along the lines of Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all who want it.\u201d The difficulties Booker faces balancing between idealism and pragmatism is reminiscent of the struggles Barack Obama faced within his party during his tenure. Why is Kamala Harris gone while Pete Buttigieg is still here? By most accounts, Booker has done well in previous debates and has an impressive resume (Senator, Mayor, Ivy League education, and Rhodes Scholar). He has even been referred to as a \u201csuperhero\u201d for several of his deeds outside of politics: In 2012, he famously raced into a burning building, pulling a neighbor from her bed and carrying her to the street. Yet, these experiences have not translated into media coverage or a bounce in the polls. Harry Enten recently tweeted that Booker might not be receiving the attention he merits because he\u2019s already been covered by the New York media for years. Buttigieg might be benefiting from being a relative unknown. To this point, Amanda Terkel wrote about the disparity in how journalists have written about Booker and Buttigieg, finding that US news outlets were seven times more likely to mention the Rhodes scholarship in stories about Buttigieg than about Booker. It turns out, however, the more voters hear from Booker, the more they are moved by him. Campaigning recently in Iowa, he drew standing ovations, brought some to the verge of tears, and persuaded many to caucus for him after they heard his message. One voter indicated that Booker had an \u201cauthenticity you can\u2019t fake.\u201d This is the kind of love he has been looking for. As Booker looks to be a unifying candidate for the country, his ability to bring together the Democratic party could provide his path to the nomination. Obama is wrong: Dems are not #TooFarLeft When I asked members of the 2016 Electoral College who they would like to see run for president in 2020, many expressed a preference for a new face \u2013 someone younger, a person of color, or a female. Generally, Booker would seem to fit this bill. Notably, Booker trails only Biden and Warren when it comes to party endorsements. Political scientist Seth Masket, who has been interviewing Democratic party activists in various early voting states, finds that Booker has been among the most liked of the aspirants throughout the year, receiving the largest share of support of any candidate in his June survey. Early state activists also express very little criticism of Booker relative to the rest of the field. Many voters make their choices based upon a candidate\u2019s personal characteristics, particularly in a high turnout election that attracts more low information voters. Booker is able to make a strong case that he is a healer, as he speaks with optimism, reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s Hope and Change. In the aftermath of a divisive impeachment battle, moderate voters will be looking for a candidate who can unite and heal the country, and Booker is well-positioned to be that person.  Barack Obama\u2019s recent warning that Democrats must root their plans in reality if they want to win has been interpreted as a jab at Warren and Sanders. In a recent pitch to Iowa voters, it is no accident that Booker asked the crowd to make sure they chose a nominee who would best be able to resurrect the Obama coalition. Clearly, he thinks he is that choice. And he just may be. But if he doesn\u2019t make the stage in December, we may never know.",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Let me start by saying this: I don\u2019t want to take away all guns. In fact, I can\u2019t think of a politician or gun violence prevention advocate who has suggested repealing the Second Amendment. However, I do believe it should be really, really, hard \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for certain people to get their hands on certain guns. We have always been a nation that self-corrects and adjusts with our changing population, economy and the wants, needs, and dreams of the American people. The sign of a thriving society is not resting on its norms or being satisfied with how it\u2019s always been. It\u2019s attempting to always leave something better then how you found it. Recently, a Texas state representative sent a bizarre, angry, and \u2014 in my view \u2014 deadly chain of social media posts in which he listed all the things he wasn\u2019t going support: assault weapons bans, extreme risk protection order laws (also known as \u201cred flag\u201d laws), universal background checks. He basically said he would oppose any tiny modicum of sensible governmental intervention to treat the epidemic of preventable gun violence raging in our nation. Guns, he claimed, are a \u201cGod-given right.\u201d I was raised Catholic. I\u2019ve read the Bible, cover-to-cover. A few times. I pray daily. I am a believer. And I sure as Sunday don\u2019t remember any passage where God says we have a right to an AR-15. I tweeted about it, asking a largely rhetorical question about where in the Bible these alleged gun rights exist. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz responded. What resulted in our back and forth on Twitter was a meeting in his Washington office, where we discussed gun laws, the role of government, and the state of the relationship between the Congress and the American people. I brought Fred Guttenberg, whose precious 14-year-old daughter Jamie was murdered in Parkland, with me so that a person who was personally devastated by gun violence could speak to the emotional truths of that experience. And I also brought my friend, Ben Jackson, a veteran and brilliant man, with whom I co-founded NoRA, who could speak to the weapons we were going to discuss. Beto O'Rourke: 'Hell yes' we'll take your AR-15 I am not going to pretend I wasn\u2019t nervous. I was. I woke up the day of the meeting with a panic attack. The nervousness wasn\u2019t because of Cruz, mind you. It was because I could feel the weight of the potential. Maybe, just maybe, Cruz might be a hero in the epidemic his devotion and allegiance to the NRA helped to create. Let me be clear: Cruz and I agree on very little. He is a stalwart conservative; I am a committed progressive. He\u2019s one of the largest recipients of NRA money in Washington in 2018, according to Open Secrets; I co-founded #NoRA expressly to get NRA money out of Washington. I support women\u2019s reproductive freedom; he is an ardent foe of abortion rights. Cruz was one of many co-sponsors of a bill which would have codified discrimination against LGBTQ people in America; I will fight until my last breath to make sure the LGBTQ community has true societal equality. I believe in enshrining women\u2019s rights in the Constitution by ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment; Cruz does not. On issue after issue we have fundamentally different views on freedom and humanity and our government. So why did I agree to meet with him? What could we possibly accomplish when we have such diametrically opposed views on, well, everything? First and foremost, I agreed to this meeting because 40,000 Americans were shot to death in America in 2017, and, as a US senator, Cruz is one of the very few people in our nation with the power to do something about it. I will talk to anyone who has this power, because lives depend on it. I also wanted to set the record straight about what gun violence prevention activists want and to demystify the right\u2019s narrative of us as \u201cgun grabbers.\u201d Alyssa Milano:  I don't have equal rights under the Constitution -- yet But mostly, I met with the senator because we can\u2019t fix the problems that face this nation unless we talk with people who disagree with us. The truth is that no matter what happens in the 2020 election, there will always be two parties in the Senate which will be close to evenly divided. If we keep living solely in our echo chambers, we will only hear what we ourselves say. And our nation will continue to suffer. I know we didn\u2019t change his mind on how we fix gun violence in America. And he didn\u2019t change ours. But maybe we understand one another a little better. Here\u2019s what I came away with that I wasn\u2019t so sure of before the meeting: Ted Cruz is a human being. He is a real person. He isn\u2019t a villain in a movie. He cares when these shootings happen. When people on my side of this fight say he doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re wrong. I hope he came away with the fact that we are caring people, and supporters of the Second Amendment, just not unlimited gun rights. I hope he recognizes a little bit more the fear parents have throughout the country and by listening to Fred\u2019s gut-wrenching story of loss, I hope he understands the pain and devastation of these fears realized. And I hope AND pray that he will find the courage to evolve enough from his calcified ideology to use his power in the Senate to convince the Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to debate, deliberate and move on the gun violence prevention bills that are on the table.  Because ultimately, that\u2019s what matters. We can have all the public debate we want. But the Senate is supposed to be our highest deliberative body, and right now, it\u2019s not deliberating, it\u2019s obstructing. Our safety and progress are being held hostage by the GOP leadership, and no amount of Twitter-inspired meetings can stop that. I hope Cruz\u2019s professed love of the law motivates him to push his party into making some. Ninety percent of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, agree that we need a fix to the problem of gun violence in this country. Maybe by talking to each other as humans, with open hearts and listening to each other with open ears, we can inspire our leaders to do the same. Isn\u2019t it worth a try? For your children. For my children. For us all.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. There are two Judiciary Committees in Congress, and this week vividly demonstrated how their leaders are moving in opposite directions on Donald Trump\u2019s White House. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham was counseling Trump\u2019s son Donald Jr. to ignore a subpoena from Graham\u2019s colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Meanwhile, in the House Judiciary Committee, chairman Jerrold Nadler was assailing what he called the White House\u2019s effort to set up President Trump as a king, immune from oversight by Congress. Jill Filipovic called out Graham, the Republican from South Carolina: \u201cTo Graham, defending the Trumps is more important than the pursuit of justice.\u201d Why? Likely, Graham is hoping to avoid any challenge from the right as he seeks re-election in 2020. \u201cThe good news is that Graham\u2019s jaw-dropping sycophancy isn\u2019t going unnoticed,\u201d Filipovic wrote, \u201c#LindseyGrahamResign is trending on Twitter\u2026\u201d Donald Trump Jr. eventually reached an agreement to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, while his father continued to dodge House investigators. All recent presidents have used their power expansively, wrote Julian Zelizer. But \u201cwhile the presidency is imperial, we have seen four major precedents that Trump is setting into place that could have enormous long-term consequences,\u201d including a blanket refusal to cooperate with Congress. In 1973, with the Watergate scandal circling Richard Nixon\u2019s White House, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. published \u201cThe Imperial Presidency.\u201d He argued that Nixon\u2019s \u201cinsistence on executive secrecy, the withholding of information from Congress, the refusal to spend funds appropriated by Congress, the attempted intimidation of the press\u201d and other abuses amounted to \u201ca revolutionary challenge to the separation of powers\u201d set out in the Constitution. Schlesinger was not a neutral historian. He had advised Democrats running for president and had served in the administration of President John F. Kennedy. But his critique of the Republican president proved influential \u2014 and this week there were clear echoes of it. The field for the Democratic nomination for president is now big enough to populate an intramural softball game, with several players to spare. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock entered the race Tuesday, just before New York Mayor Bill de Blasio became the 23rd Democrat to jump aboard. Bullock wrote, \u201cDonald Trump will get another four years in the White House if we don\u2019t win back the places that voted for him\u201d and contended that as someone who has won election in a red state, he\u2019s well positioned to beat Trump. \u201cIf there\u2019s one person who can unite this nation,\u201d observed Harry Siegel in the Daily Beast, \u201cit\u2019s New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who likes to prattle on about his transcendent, historic vision and who (polls confirm) roughly nobody wants running for president after he\u2019s flirted with the idea for months.\u201d Arick Wierson thought, \u201cthe worst part about de Blasio isn\u2019t his resume or lack thereof \u2013 it\u2019s the threat he poses to all the Democrats running for president. Trump may be a modern-day carnival barker, but de Blasio risks making the entire Democratic party seem like a circus.\u201d The Democratic field is so big, and the party\u2019s new delegate rules so different, that Republican Ken Cuccinelli argued there\u2019s a good chance of the often-imagined but rarely seen, contested political convention, in which no candidate gets enough votes to win on the first ballot. Superdelegates can\u2019t affect the outcome of voting in the first ballot, Cuccinelli noted. \u201cIf no candidate wins on the first ballot, those superdelegates can vote in all subsequent ballots. The result in 2020 may well be that they can effectively play the role of kingmaker.\u201d The controversy over Georgia\u2019s new abortion law was just beginning to subside when Alabama\u2019s legislature passed, and the governor signed, the most restrictive law in the nation. Doctors who perform abortions could get 99-year prison sentences. Neither law is likely to take effect before being challenged in court. These and other anti-abortion laws are about one thing, wrote law professor Carliss Chatman. \u201cAnti-choice legislators believe they will face a friendly bench in the Supreme Court.\u201d Their hope is that the court\u2019s strengthened conservative majority will overturn Roe v. Wade. But the opposition to the new laws is fully energized. Alyssa Milano trended on Twitter with her call for a sex strike, and followed up, with co-author Waleisah Wilson, on CNN Opinion: \u201cCalling for a sex strike as a way to protest restrictions on abortion has sparked a powerful response. Sure, it\u2019s been a mixed reaction, but it got the country talking about the GOP\u2019s undeniable war on women. And let\u2019s face it, with so much going on every day in the news, sometimes we need an extreme response to get national attention.\u201d Peggy Drexler questioned Milano\u2019s approach: \u201cThe Georgia law is a blow, for sure. But Milano\u2019s message, though attention-grabbing, was misguided. And far from feminist. In fact, it largely served to reinforce the idea that women\u2019s power lies primarily in their willingness to \u2018give\u2019 men sex and that abstinence is the way to get that power back.\u201d Carrie Sheffield, who opposes abortion, argued that new laws are needed. \u201cThe problem with leaders like Bill Clinton and others operating under the mantra of \u2018safe, legal and rare\u2019 is that abortion has become anything but rare in America. Yes, conservatives can and should do more to support women and men\u2019s access to birth control for prevention of unwanted pregnancies, but the left must also do more to avoid termination.\u201d Diane McWhorter offered a fascinating look at the history and politics of Alabama as it was caught in the national spotlight: \u201cAnd so it goes in Alabama, our laboratory of democracy, with the loftiest accomplishments and most dismal fails.\u201d And Jay Parini noted an irreconcilable hypocrisy among those, like Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who claim a pro-life mantle even as they support state-sponsored executions. The death penalty is \u201cnot up for debate, in my view,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to kill people. Period. It\u2019s barbarous, inhumane, cruel, and \u2013 thank goodness \u2013 rare in most civilized countries.\u201d For Alabama ob/gyn Yashica Robinson, the new law is personal. \u201cJust as I have for the last 15 years of my medical career, I will continue to deliver babies, give prenatal care \u2013 and provide abortions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI became pregnant when I was in high school. Because of my fear and lack of resources, I didn\u2019t confide in my mother or grandmother until it was too late to have an abortion. I love my children with all my heart, but I know that everyone should be able to make this decision for themselves.\u201d CNN host and comedian W. Kamau Bell wrote that it was his turn. \u201cFifteen years,\u201d his wife Melissa told him. \u201c\u2018For fifteen years, I\u2019ve been taking the pill.\u2019 That means my wife had been altering her body chemistry for my pleasure and carrying the responsibility of our family planning, while I just got to be footloose and condom-free.\u201d He decided to get a vasectomy and timed it for an episode of his show \u201cUnited Shades of America\u201d that focused on women in Jackson, Mississippi, fighting for reproductive justice. \u201cIf those badass women can stand up in the face of all that, then I can lie down for a ten-minute surgery.\u201d Hopes of a peace treaty in the trade war with China continued to fade this week. And fears of a real war with Iran grew. Trump is missing an important opportunity with China, argued Frida Ghitis, by only focusing on trade and ignoring allegations of widespread human rights abuses, particularly in Xinjiang, a territory with a majority Muslim population. \u201cThe regime\u2019s abuse of human rights is one of its Achilles heels\u2026Reviving the topic could help ease the misery in Xinjiang, with the added benefit of giving Trump more leverage on trade.\u201d Trying to make sense of Trump\u2019s \u201cseemingly chaotic trade policies,\u201d Steven Strauss wrote in USA Today that \u201cif Trump\u2019s goal is to make America a crony capitalist kleptocracy, where profits don\u2019t depend on free markets but on cozying up to Trump, his trade policy makes perfect sense.\u201d It could even help him win re-election, Strauss said. \u201cIn 2020, Trump will position himself as a populist and nationalist who stands up for the American worker.\u201d SIGN UP TO GET OUR NEW WEEKLY COLUMN AS A NEWSLETTER. On the Iran front, the President\u2019s intentions may be harder to figure out. Trump\u2019s national security adviser John Bolton has been a key figure in the administration\u2019s effort to counter Iran\u2019s influence in the Middle East. But \u201cBolton\u2019s enthusiasm for the muscular use of the military seems out of place in the administration of a President who has repeatedly questioned and sought to end America\u2019s wars in the Middle East,\u201d wrote Peter Bergen, as reports circulated that Trump was unhappy with his adviser\u2019s handling of the Iran and Venezuela crises. Trump just wants a phone call from the Iranians, wrote Jamsheed and Carol Choksy, as unlikely as that sounds. Citing the talks with North Korea, they note, \u201cTehran\u2019s leadership should bear in mind that for Trump, a deal seems to be \u2018horrible\u2019 unless it is proposed by his administration. Only then can it be deemed \u2018fair\u2019 if not \u2018great.\u2019\u201d Ultimately, Trump\u2019s legacy may be tainted forever by his failure to act on the climate change challenge, wrote David Gergen and James Piltch. \u201cClimate change is certainly as grave a danger to American prosperity and global security as World War II\u2026 With the news this week that the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is at its highest point in human history, the clock is ticking loudly.\u201d Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart took a more sonic approach to the same topic: \u201cI live in the forest in Northern California, where deer, wild turkeys, egrets, acorn woodpeckers, and stellar jays surround me every morning, and where I can pound out my own rhythms along with the cacophony of frogs each night. In places where you can see and hear nature\u2019s beauty regularly, it can sometimes be easy to forget\u2026nature\u2019s rhythm is dying because we\u2019re killing the Earth.\u201d In the Perspectives section of CNN Business, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders noted that many credit card users are being charged interest rates higher than 20%. \u201cLast year, Wall Street banks made $113 billion in credit card interest alone, up by nearly 50% in just five years,\u201d Sanders wrote. Banks are \u201csqueezing working families that are already in financial distress down to the bone. That should not be happening in the United States of America.\u201d Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez want to cap credit card interest rates at 15%. That would be a huge mistake, wrote Diego Zuluaga of the Cato Institute: \u201cThe consequences of a cap would be disastrous, removing access to credit for millions of low- and moderate-income households and forcing them to rely on family members, tighten their belts or seek higher-cost forms of credit.\u201d Reps.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. To succeed in the primary and general election, former Vice President Joe Biden needs to demonstrate his willingness to form a broad coalition with the various factions of the Democratic Party. This week, however, he once again moved in the wrong direction, drawing sharp criticism from his presidential competition. During a fundraising event in New York on Tuesday, Biden tried to highlight his ability to reach across the aisle by referencing his work in the 1970s with Mississippi Sen. James Eastland, one of the most virulent racists of the era. \u201cI was in a caucus with James O. Eastland. He never called me \u2018boy,\u2019 he always called me \u2018son,\u2019 \u201d Biden said. \u201cWell guess what? At least there was some civility. We got things done,\u201d he said. For some black voters, Joe Biden is deeply problematic. But Trump is even worse But Eastland, a well-known segregationist who spent most of his life defending white supremacy, was one of the southern Democrats responsible for holding back bills that would have integrated the South and provided voting rights for African-Americans. Biden\u2019s decision to invoke Eastland became even more damaging when archival research resurfaced, showing how Biden sought Eastland\u2019s help on anti-busing legislation in 1977. Liberal critics rightly jumped at Biden\u2019s choice and questioned why he didn\u2019t highlight his work with less notorious southern Democrats or Republican Sens. Robert Dole or John McCain instead. Given how devastating the power of southern Democrats had been to civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s, there was no reason \u2013 especially in 2019 \u2013 to fondly recall any kind of working relationship with Eastland. Biden launched his campaign in April with a video emphasizing the values at stake in this election. To drive home the point, he said there was a \u201cbattle for the soul of this nation\u201d and recalled President Donald Trump\u2019s infamous response that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d at the far-right rally in Charlottesville in 2017. Given this context, liberals argue Biden should be much more sensitive to why his comments about Eastland matter. While civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis came to Biden\u2019s defense, other Democrats, including presidential hopeful Cory Booker called for an apology. Sen. Kamala Harris, another 2020 candidate, said Biden\u2019s comments were \u201cdeeply wrong.\u201d GOP panelist: Biden's comments on segregationist senators illustrate why he won't be the nominee This is not the first time that Biden has clashed with liberal voices in his party. Other fault lines have already emerged on his changing positions toward reproductive rights (his support of of the Hyde Amendment that prohibited federal funds from being used for abortion), sexual harassment (his treatment of Anita Hill who accused Clarence Thomas sexual misconduct) and crime (his sponsorship of the 1994 crime legislation and its aftermath). With the exception of his reversal on the Hyde Amendment, Biden has been pretty resolute in defending his positions. Conservatives are loving the turmoil. Bret Stephens of The New York Times predictably jumped into the fray, dismissing the \u201cnasty left\u201d by calling their approach to politics \u201capocalyptic.\u201d Stephens goes so far as to compare the left to the Trumpian right. Repeating his common \u201cboth sides do it\u201d refrain, Stephens posits that liberals who take issue with Biden\u2019s willing associations with a rabid white supremacist are just as extreme as Trumpian Republicans. Stephens goes on to suggest that Biden should disregard the left\u2019s criticism, writing that he would be \u201ca fool\u201d to apologize for his remarks. Unfortunately, Biden and his team seem to be responding accordingly. He has often refused to engage with the criticism from his own party or in some cases, pushed back. In one particularly dramatic moment this week, Biden responded to Booker\u2019s call to apologize by saying, \u201cApologize for what? Cory (Booker) should apologize. He knows better. There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body.\u201d Call Doc Brown! Someone needs to bring Joe Biden back ... to the future Biden\u2019s approach is curious and flawed. Given that much of his campaign has been built around the idea that he is the candidate best suited to reach out to Independents and Republicans, why is he displaying such a different attitude when it comes to members of his own party? Rather than showcasing the civility he keeps talking about with Republicans, he has taken a much more adversarial stance with liberals. It begs the question that if he can\u2019t make peace with people in his own party who are generally on the same page in terms of values and policies, how will he ever convince Republicans like Sen. Mitch McConnell to cooperate with him on anything? Shouldn\u2019t aggressive outreach start at home? To defeat Trump, an incumbent with a strong economy and solid party support, Biden will need the full force of his party to mobilize supporters and turn out the vote needed to win. Biden needs to spend more time between now and January demonstrating that he can be a coalition builder within the Democratic Party. He needs to take seriously the concerns that have arisen about his long record in the Senate as well as his recent fumbles by addressing his critics rather than waving them away. While some conservatives often dismiss the disproportionate noise of \u201cwoke\u201d progressives, Biden should take stock of the party, and take the time to craft speeches and policy proposals that will demonstrate an ability to bridge the Democratic factions. What 'The West Wing' reveals about Joe Biden Effective candidates like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were able to rally the party together, even during the course of heated primaries. Clinton used the recession to do so, while Obama did it with his opposition to the war in Iraq. If Biden really wants to thrive during the primaries, he should stick to the message laid out early in his campaign launch and focus on the threat of a second term for Trump. Let\u2019s not forget \u2013 while Biden\u2019s ability to work with Republicans might seem like a pleasant talking point, there\u2019s no evidence it would produce results in today\u2019s fevered political world. Given the partisanship that has taken root in the decades since Biden first entered Congress, harping on about reaching across the aisle may appear out of touch with reality. If Biden wants to be the Democrat his supporters believe he can be, he needs to ignore the Bret Stephens of the world and instead show how that he can be a coalition builder among Democrats unlike anyone else in the field. It\u2019s time for Biden to demonstrate the same willingness to reach out to his fellow Democrats as he does with right-wing Republicans who have little interest in doing anything other than biting off his outreached hand.  At this pivotal moment in the campaign, Biden might recall different words from John Lewis, who stood before civil rights activists at the March on Washington in 1963 and warned of the high price parties pay as a result of racism. Lewis said, \u201cMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course. We salute those. But what political leader can stand up and say, \u2018My party is the party of principles?\u2019 For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater. Where is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham.\u201d The social revolution remains incomplete. Biden, who served in the historic administration of the first African-American president, has the opportunity to campaign as a Democrat who will heed Lewis\u2019s warning many decades later. Doing so will require recognizing the dangers of compromise on certain key issues and dealing head-on with the racism that remains a blight on our country.",

The view expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. This month, a record number of women will be on stage when the Democrats meet for their first presidential debates. That two of them \u2013 Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris \u2013 are polling in the top five of the 23-person field only adds to the excitement of this historic moment. Yet the women who matter most will be on the other side of the stage. Any Democratic path to victory in 2020 likely runs through the female voters of America. Women could make up 60% of the Democratic vote in 2020, according to CNN senior political analyst Ronald Brownstein. And they are likely to be key swing voters in the general election \u2013 just as they were in the 2018 midterm election, when suburban and white college-educated women voted to elect larger numbers of Democrats to Congress. So, what do women want to hear? Women will be listening closely to how the candidates speak on the bread-and-butter issues \u2013 like the economy and health care \u2013 but through the prism of how they uniquely affect women. They\u2019ll be looking for assurances that the would-be presidents understand the nuances of their lives. On the matter of economics and jobs, women will be paying close attention to discussion of equal pay laws, which have been on the books for decades, and yet have been largely ineffective in closing the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s wages. Women still, on average, make only about 80% of what men earn. And the gender pay gap is dramatically worse for some groups: It stands at 61% for black women and 53% for Latinas. What happens when women rule Women across the political spectrum care deeply about the nation\u2019s pay and leadership disparities \u2013 but it\u2019s worth noting that there is a sharp gender divide on the issue. Nearly half of all men say the gender pay gap is \u201cmade up to serve a political purpose,\u201d according to a TIME Magazine survey. Among women, 71% say it is \u201cvery unfair\u201d that women are paid less than men \u2013 and they want action. They\u2019ll be looking for candidates to articulate robust plans to close the gaps that hold women back. This includes introducing policies like paid parental leave and affordable child care. Moreover, the national statistics are clear: Women are over-represented among low-wage workers and the poor. Five million more women than men live below the poverty line \u2013 and women make up six in ten low-wage workers in almost every state in America. Proposals to boost family income, such as Sens. Harris and Cory Booker have offered, or that reduce the cost of living, like Warren\u2019s housing plan, will resonate strongly with women \u2013 even though they aren\u2019t billed as \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d 2020 is not a fair playing field. Here's how to even it out But it\u2019s not just the economy that matters to women, particularly in this moment. History shows that when legal abortion appears at risk during a presidential election, women are energized to turn out for candidates who defend reproductive rights. With Republicans having introduced 378 bills restricting or banning abortion in a bid to overturn or gut Roe v. Wade since January of this year, reproductive freedom and the preservation of Roe will be a major driver of the women\u2019s vote in 2020. Candidates who shy away from unequivocal support for reproductive freedom will be at a disadvantage with the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. According to a Huff Post/YouGov poll, 63% of women who voted for Hillary Clinton say abortion will be very important to their 2020 vote.  Meanwhile, 24% of Generation Z and Millennial women rank abortion as the most important factor in their 2020 presidential vote. What woman presidential candidates are facing Of course, women\u2019s concerns go beyond equal pay and reproductive freedom. In particular, they\u2019ll be watching closely for candidates\u2019 statements on issues that impact families and children. For example, compared to men, women are more worried about school shootings and believe laws regulating gun sales should be stricter. Women are looking for policies that will help them in their everyday lives. Yet beyond that, they want a candidate who speaks to their values. Women are disgusted with the tone of our politics, particularly with the post-2016 surge in sexism. Three-quarters of Democratic and black women are dissatisfied with how women are treated. In 2018 exit polls, roughly eight in 10 voters rated sexual harassment a serious problem. Let\u2019s trust that the debate moderators won\u2019t limit their \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d questions to the female candidates. The women of America need to hear what the ambitious men who want to be president have to say about their lives.  Sens. Harris, Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, with their innovative proposals on reproductive freedom, universal child care, maternal mortality and more, have raised the bar for the rest of the field. Do the male candidates speak fluently and substantively to what matters most to women? Do their records in office and plans for the nation\u2019s future indicate they\u2019ll make women\u2019s freedom, equality and opportunity a priority? We\u2019re all ears.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. A week ago, Joe Biden seemed to be sailing to the Democratic nomination. His nearly flawless launch had allayed doubts about the durability of his support, his ability to raise enough money and even his desire to enter the fray. Biden\u2019s shrewd strategic decision to train his fire on Donald Trump from the start, essentially bypassing the primary and jumping to the main event, instantly seemed to solidify his front-runner status. In a party desperate to defeat the President, the former vice president presented himself as the seasoned warrior, suiting up for one last battle to defend the fundamental democratic values and norms Trump has sundered. The result was an immediate eight-point boost in his lead in national polling, doubling that of his closest competitor, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and lapping the field. The money poured in. Trump signaled his assumption \u2013 and, perhaps, concern \u2013 that Biden would be his opponent by firing off a fusillade of malign tweets. Will voters care if Biden does fewer interviews or events than his rivals? Biden\u2019s early strength in primary polls also reflected the value of his partnership with President Barack Obama. It\u2019s an enormous asset with Democrats and, particularly, black voters, who make up a quarter of the primary electorate and could be Biden\u2019s firewall in the nomination battle. The prevailing question became, \u201cCan Biden be beaten?\u201d Well, he\u2019s still the front-runner. But after his last, shambling week, the new question is \u201cCan Biden hang on?\u201d (Both questions are a little foolish at this stage but, hey, it\u2019s what we do!) The former VP and his campaign sowed new doubts with their clumsily shifting answers on the fundamental issue of federal funding of abortion. To review, Biden had long supported the Hyde Amendment, a provision in federal law barring the use of federal funds for abortion. He was not alone. Many Democrats have concurred with Hyde, albeit reluctantly, if only to forestall more drastic restrictions. But recent moves toward draconian limits on abortion in the states, and fears over the future of Roe v. Wade with a new Supreme Court alignment, have created a backlash among abortion-rights voters and Hyde is now a target. When Biden was asked twice by a woman on the campaign trail whether he would support the repeal of Hyde, he gave her an unqualified yes. But when video of the exchange surfaced last week, his campaign said he had \u201cmisheard\u201d the question and still supported the ban. Biden caves on the Hyde Amendment: what was the point of his candidacy? Twenty-four hours later, after drawing fire from opponents and pleas from supporters, Biden reversed field again and announced his opposition to Hyde. Compounding the awkwardness of this flip-flop-flip were the post-mortem stories in which Biden\u2019s staff at first appeared to take credit for his change of mind and then said he made the decision himself in the car en route to the dinner at which he announced it. Politicians flip and flop. That is not news. And every campaign survives occasional bumps in the road that are breathlessly reported yet rarely decisive. Still, this episode revived larger questions about the front-runner, who has twice failed to survive Iowa in previous bids for the presidency. First, he \u201cmisheard the question\u201d may have been an honest answer but probably not the card you want to play too often when your candidate would be 78 the first day he occupies the Oval Office. So far, Biden has pursued a much lighter schedule than the other candidates. He went an entire 10-day stretch recently without a public appearance, and those he makes are carefully choreographed. He largely has avoided the media or challenging interview settings. It may be a smart strategy to a point, but the Rose Garden can become a Game of Thorns if the sense grows that the aging candidate is being protected from himself. The campaign is a proving ground to show he is up to the demands of the job. Second, there is the double-edged sword of longevity. One of Biden\u2019s assets is that his nearly half-century in politics gives voters a sense of comfort and familiarity. She wants to lock him up One of his greatest liabilities is that along with his nearly half-century in politics come countless votes and statements on a wide array of issues. Some have very different connotations in a new era and changing Democratic Party than they did when he made them. Hyde will not be the last. Taken on its own, the Hyde stumble was hardly fatal. But Biden is ahead, in no small part, because he seems the least risky choice for a party intent on beating Trump. More weeks like the last, and Biden could lose that edge. The other mixed news for Biden came with the release of the new Iowa Poll, conducted by The Des Moines Register and CNN. On the upside, Biden is still the Iowa leader, with 24%, eight points higher than Sanders. The bad news is that his support has slipped by a third since December. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has been making steady gains, followed Sanders by a point. Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2013 an asterisk six months ago \u2013 stood a point behind Warren at 14%. Sen. Kamala Harris was at 7%, and was the No. 1 \u201csecond choice\u201d in the poll, which is more meaningful in a caucus than a primary. In short, it\u2019s a horse race in Iowa, and Biden, who makes only his second tour there as a candidate on Tuesday, is no lock to win. His supporters report being far less enthusiastic than those of the other top tier contenders, which is important in caucuses where motivation to show up is essential. CNN Poll: Biden still leading Democratic pick in Iowa For the first months of his campaign, Biden has run as the putative nominee. But with the presumption of leadership comes the expectation of success. Second or third in Iowa would be considered a victory for Warren, Buttigieg or Harris. For Biden, who received just 1% there in 2008, anything less than victory could be the beginning of an unraveling. Biden bypassed a candidate cattle call in Iowa this weekend and waited to return to Iowa on Tuesday \u2013 the same day Trump hits the state. It serves the former vice president\u2019s strategy of turning the page to the general election. And polls continue to show Biden leading Trump in critical states the President needs to win re-election. But the events of the last week and the Iowa Poll should serve as a warning: No one is going to hand Biden the Democratic nomination. He\u2019ll have to engage fully and fight for it if he is to get the face-off with Trump he is seeking.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Joe Biden, while still enjoying his frontrunner status, is facing some challenges during this nascent Democratic primary. They are unsurprising and often self-imposed. There\u2019s his plagiarism past, brought up again when it was discovered he (or his campaign) had lifted several passages from think tanks and other organizations for his new climate change plan. There\u2019s his previous support for the now-controversial 1994 crime bill, which he\u2019s still defending, despite progressives\u2019 panning of the legislation, particularly because it contributed to the disproportionate incarceration of people of color. 2020 rankings: Despite attacks, Biden holds lead And there\u2019s his campaign aides\u2019 awkward attempt to explain a 1987 gaffe resurrected by the New York Times \u2013 his claim that he marched during the Civil Rights movement when he most certainly did not. And now there is abortion. He just announced\u2013in a speech in Atlanta Thursday\u2013that he no longer backs the Hyde Amendment, the 1976 measure that prohibits federal funding for abortion except in the case of rape, incest and endangering the life of the mother. This is his third position just this week. Only a day earlier, when asked in a rope line if he\u2019d repeal the Hyde Amendment, he said he would.  But then his campaign quickly backtracked, saying he misheard the question and that he still supports the measure. This naturally unleashed a flurry of responses from his Democratic challengers: Cory Booker clapped back on NBC: \u201cI think the Hyde Amendment is wrong.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke tweeted: \u201cNo matter your income or where you live, every woman should have access to health care including abortion.\u201d Kamala Harris weighed in. \u201cNo woman\u2019s access to reproductive health care should be based on how much money she has. We must repeal the Hyde Amendment,\u201d she tweeted. Others have been, er, less measured. As one abortion columnist hyperventilated in the Washington Post: \u201cBiden\u2019s position on this issue should disqualify him from contention for the nomination.\u201d Dem presidential candidates attack Biden en masse for support of Hyde amendment It seems Biden has now caved to all that progressive pressure. Which raises the question: What, exactly, is the point of his candidacy? The fact is, Biden was right to back the Hyde Amendment on both the principle and the politics. For starters, as many progressives are surprised to just now discover, Biden has long been a moderate on abortion, even bordering on conservative at times. That includes his past objections to Medicaid funding of abortions. As NBC recently reported, his personal opposition to abortion might be news to many, but it isn\u2019t a secret. Biden is a Roman Catholic who has openly discussed his evolving views over decades. Among the \u201csurprises\u201d uncovered: In a 1994 letter to voters he bragged that he\u2019d \u201con no fewer than 50 occasions\u201d voted against federal funding of abortions. He told the Catholic Diocese Newspaper that \u201cabortion is wrong from the moment of conception.\u201d He even once voted for an amendment to allow states to overturn Roe, a measure that didn\u2019t pass and that he considered \u201cthe single most difficult vote I\u2019ve cast as a Senator.\u201d But he\u2019s also moderated over time, saying he now supports Roe v. Wade as the law of the land and would not impose his religious views on women. While running with Barack Obama in 2008, he earned endorsements from NARAL and Planned Parenthood. CNN's John King calls out Biden for 'amateur mistake' In short, his support of the Hyde Amendment was consistent with his long voting record and personal beliefs. That he hadn\u2019t abandoned his position made him principled \u2013 something we voters could use more of. It was also politically prudent. According to a 2016 poll for Politico by the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, only 36% of likely voters want to overturn Hyde. Unless attitudes have significantly shifted since then \u2013 and new polling is needed \u2013 Biden\u2019s position was right in line with a majority of Americans. The truth is, most Americans are not extremists on abortion, despite the extreme new laws in states like Georgia and Alabama. According to Gallup, only 29% of Americans think abortion should be legal in all circumstances, and only 18% believe it should be illegal in all circumstances. The Democrats\u2019 sudden revulsion over the Hyde Amendment is just that: sudden. The amendment survived three Democratic Presidents \u2013 Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. All at one point enjoyed majorities in Congress. None made any serious attempt to repeal it. How Donald Trump is doing Joe Biden a great favor Biden\u2019s reasonable approach to the issue was smart. Whereas the rest of the Democratic candidates will find themselves way outside the norm for the general election, Biden was positioned to reach moderates and independents as well as most Democrats. In his 2007 book, \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d Biden described his position on abortion as \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d Wasn\u2019t that the point of his candidacy? To occupy a moderate lane that far-left progressives had abandoned over the past few years? To capture the forgotten Democrats in the middle of the country, the voters the party had left behind for the coastal elites? With his abandonment of the moderate view on abortion, he\u2019s ceding not only fertile voting territory but the thing that set him apart from a field of far-left progressives who don\u2019t represent a majority of Americans. What\u2019s the point in that? This op-ed was updated from an earlier version on the news of Joe Biden\u2019s reversal of his position on the Hyde Amendment.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. As most Americans were easing into their first weekend in June after a chaotic and preoccupied week in the news, tragedy stole a march on our souls \u2013 confronting us with yet more gun violence, this time at the hands of a Virginia Beach city worker who opened fire at a municipal building. Speaking at a news conference after the mass shooting that killed 12 and left four injured, Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer called Friday evening his city\u2019s \u201cdarkest hour,\u201d and police Chief James Cervera vowed his department would say the shooter\u2019s name \u2013 only once, before keeping his city\u2019s focus squarely on the victims. Putting words to what many were feeling, Jonathan Wackrow tweeted, \u201cWhen it comes to addressing mass-shooting incidents, we need to develop a new model to address these senseless acts of violence.\u201d Jill Filipovic concurred, challenging leaders and citizens alike: \u201cAnother 12 innocent people have been gunned down. Don\u2019t just nod along as politicians issue their thoughts and prayers.\u201d America needs everyone at the table to find a way forward, Filipovic emphasized: \u201cWe, as a country, face a choice. Every gun owner and gun proponent faces a choice.\u201d On Wednesday, the special counsel surprised everyone by announcing he\u2019d be making a statement to the press at 11 a.m. He told reporters he was resigning from the Justice Department and emphasized passages from his famous report. \u201cThere were multiple, systematic efforts to interference in our election,\u201d he said, with the tone and posture of an exasperated college professor surrounded by unprepared students, \u201cand that allegation deserves the attention of every American.\u201d But he said much more, and by Wednesday afternoon, Mueller Time was again in full swing, with Democrats, Republicans, pundits and the Twitterverse parsing his word cocktail. His carefully chosen words packed a punch, wrote Frida Ghitis: \u201cReading between the lines, Mueller appeared to suggest that if he had not been shackled by Department of Justice regulations, the special counsel would have indicted the President. He said: \u2018If we had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\u2019 \u201d Mueller \u201csent an unmistakable message to Congress,\u201d affirmed Elie Honig: \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d But Michael D\u2019Antonio suggested the bottom line was clear: \u201cIf you follow Robert Mueller\u2019s words,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey lead to one conclusion: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has no choice but to begin the process of impeaching President Donald Trump.\u201d Not so fast, argued Carrie Sheffield, rejecting impeachment as \u201cdivisive for the nation and a boon to our global competitors.\u201d Mueller is moving on, she pointed out, and Democrats should recognize that it\u2019s time for them \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 to turn the page. Another smart take: \u2013 Shanlon Wu: The fate of America is in the hands of Congress If it seems like Mueller Time will never end, the same could be said for Trump\u2019s feud with the late Sen. John McCain. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday evening that White House staff had asked Navy officials to keep the USS John McCain out of Trump\u2019s line of sight during his recent visit to Japan \u2013 and when that didn\u2019t work, to cloak the ship\u2019s name with a tarp and later a work barge. (Trump denied Thursday knowing about the plan, which the Navy confirmed Friday, but according to the Journal, Trump also defended the official who ordered the ship out of sight.) As Helaine Olen put it in The Washington Post, \u201cTrump\u2019s feud with McCain perfectly captured the former\u2019s thin skin.\u201d She suggested the whole affair smacked of efforts under Stalin to strike dissenters from the historical record: \u201cIt was a form of rewriting history by erasing it from existence. Trump, it is obvious, would like to do the same.\u201d Also writing about the President\u2019s trip to Japan, Diane H. Mazur criticized \u201cthe latest breach of America\u2019s civil-military tradition of political neutrality\u201d: the \u201cMake Aircrew Great Again\u201d patches some service members aboard a US Navy ship docked there were wearing as a play on \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d This type of violation is particularly troubling, Mazur elaborated, because this President \u201cisn\u2019t asking for military advice. He\u2019s asking for applause, for affirmation, for a pledge of personal loyalty on a decision he has already made in his own mind.\u201d The revelation that McCain\u2019s name was apparently too much for the President to bear came days after Trump declared he won\u2019t work with Congress as long as Democrats continue their \u201cphony investigations.\u201d The deeper problem with the commander in chief\u2019s well-documented petulance, diagnosed Ted Gup, is that it constitutes abdication: \u201cFor the foreseeable future the presidency will be both vacant and occupied, with the country reduced to waiting out his tantrum and deciphering its future from a fusillade of tweets and campaign-like rants.\u201d More smart takes: \u2013 Alice Driver: Trump\u2019s Mexico tariff plan overlooks the root causes of migration \u2013 Julian Zelizer: How Justin Amash\u2019s one-man revolt against Trump could gain steam The Supreme Court this past week previewed its potential strategy in fielding challenges to Roe v. Wade from the states, opined law professor Carliss Chatman. It is: to \u201cavoid making a decision unless it is absolutely necessary.\u201d That was Chatman\u2019s interpretation of the court\u2019s 7-2 decision to uphold an Indiana law requiring health care facilities to bury or cremate fetal remains \u2013 while declining to consider a portion of the law banning abortion providers from terminating pregnancies on the basis of fetal characteristics such as gender, race or disability diagnosis. She surmised, \u201c(The) justices are signaling that the recent draconian abortion laws will not succeed in overturning settled law on a woman\u2019s right to abortion.\u201d For women in these states seeking abortions, said Rafia Zakaria, such a backdoor defense of Roe may not make any difference. Missouri, for example, was on the cusp of becoming the first US state with no clinics providing abortion care after a showdown Friday between the state\u2019s last abortion clinic and its health department over renewal of an operating license ended in reprieve. A temporary injunction will last until Tuesday, but as Zakaria wrote, the red-tape standoff is telling: \u201cThe message in all of it is clear; whatever federal courts may do, local officials can create all kinds of hurdles that cause clinics such as this last one, to stop offering abortion care or close their doors entirely.\u201d Writing for The New York Times, evangelical minister Rob Schenck explained why his faith prompted him to abandon his anti-abortion stance: \u201cAs I\u2019ve preached countless times, loving our neighbors means meeting them where they are, not where we want them to be. \u2026 To my former allies who are cheering on the challenges to Roe, I say: Put your money where your mouth is. Devote yourself and your considerable resources to taking care of poor women and their children before you champion laws that hem them into impossible situations.\u201d Raul Reyes responded to a New York Times report revealing that files found on the hard drives of late GOP strategist Thomas Hofeller \u2013 by his estranged daughter after his death last year \u2013 showed he wrote the key portion of a draft letter that the Department of Justice used to maintain that including the citizenship question on the census (an issue pending before the Supreme Court) was needed to help enforce the Voting Rights Act. \u201cIt is a national disgrace that the Trump administration appears to be using the census as a tool of voter suppression,\u201d Reyes insisted. Across the world, people are observing the start of Pride Month, an especially poignant occasion as June 28, 1969, marks the 50th anniversary of the historic uprising at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, recognized as a turning point in the global movement for LGBTQ rights. There are reasons for LGBTQ Americans to be hopeful: Younger generations of religious voters and evangelicals are trending toward equality, even in the reddest of red states, Samantha Allen wrote. Utah, for example, \u201cis becoming a strange and deeply imperfect LGBTQ pioneer\u201d whose \u201cstark contrasts and political unpredictability aren\u2019t a sign of a state in an identity crisis \u2026 (but) simply the growing pains that we can expect the country at large to go through as we move toward full LGBTQ equality.\u201d The Rev. Jennifer Butler preached that Christian love is a challenge \u2013 to stand up to perverse politics \u2013 not a weapon to sideline the marginalized further. And she rejected a Trump administration effort to roll back anti-discrimination health care provisions for transgender Americans and Americans who have previously undergone an abortion. While there is no single entity to blame here, the shocking images and rising death toll among Mount Everest climbers are stark reminders, reflected Jill Filipovic. Nepal\u2019s government, guide companies and ultimately, the climbers themselves share responsibility. \u201cEverest is a dream for many,\u201d Filipovic observed, but not every dream should be realized \u2013 especially when it risks others\u2019 lives. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to scale a mountain to live out a dream if what you aspire to is a life rich with experience,\u201d she concluded. As former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams wrote in The New York Times on the question of power, \u201c(H)uman beings still have the ability to put themselves right with the power that lies around them. Such ability depends on their readiness to loosen their grip on the world that is crushed and torn by the force of their holding.\u201d The 92nd Scripps National Spelling Bee ended with an epic and historic win \u2013 by eight co-champions. Anthropologist Shalini Shankar spent six years doing research on spelling bees and talking to parents of competitors. Gen X parents are embracing an approach increasingly focused on competition and resilience, Shankar observed, attributes \u201con full display at the National Spelling Bee championship finals.\u201d Not all parents were praising the Bee; Meagan Francis, writing for NBC Think, argued her child has better things to do than ritualize memorization skills. Over at The Washington Post, Theresa Vargas called a halt to the parental grumbling and backlash about the \u201coctochamps,\u201d insisting: \u201cTo them and the many other naysayers of the Bee, I have one word for you: Enough. \u2026 Enough with calling for the end of a competition that, if nothing else, makes us pause for a few days each year to think about language.\u201d Competing comes with risks, something organizers of professional sports must heed more closely, argued Jeff Pearlman after a ghastly accident where a line-drive foul ball hit by a Chicago Cubs player struck a child. The incident brought the player, Albert Almora Jr., to his knees with horror, and Pearlman maintained that Major League Baseball could \u2013 and should \u2013 be doing more to avoid fan injury. World-famous chefs Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and Eric Ripert, close friends of the late Anthony Bourdain\u2019s, announced that June 25 will be \u201cBourdain Day,\u201d a time for friends and fans to celebrate him. Meredith McCarroll, a scholar of Appalachia and co-editor of a book rejecting the monochromatic interpretation of the region offered by JD Vance\u2019s \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d offered her own remembrance. She wrote movingly of how \u2013 after decades of documentary exploitation of the region \u2013 Bourdain\u2019s episode of \u201cParts Unknown\u201d set in West Virginia resisted becoming \u201cpoverty porn.\u201d Instead, what he offered viewers was an authentic portrait rendered by an outsider who asked, \u201cWhat do I need to know about this place?\u201d \u2013 and then truly listened for the answers. Not all stories that stay with us are good ones, though that doesn\u2019t mean we get to look away. Paul Callan, who represented the assistant district attorneys whose work ultimately exonerated the Central Park Five, revisited the case through the eyes of Ava DuVernay\u2019s Netflix docudrama, \u201cWhen They See Us.\u201d Callan lamented the \u201cultimate shame\u201d \u2013 that even today, those \u201cwho were the moving force behind this tragic case refuse to concede that they sent five innocent men to prison.\u201d This weekend is Walt Whitman\u2019s 200th birthday. Scholar Karen Karbiener asked: What are we celebrating?  As for Karbiener, she wrote of Uncle Walt: \u201cThis complicated and conflicted American also envisioned, described and celebrated a truly democratic society that neither his era nor our own has yet realized.\u201d Whitman\u2019s embodiment of a divided, chaotic America is a timely metaphor and reminder that our current polarization has a very long history. And writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books\u2019 site Avidly, Monique Morgan served up a satirical take on a similarly serious subject: poetry and contemporary democracy.

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. If Washington politics were a movie, this week might be the time you turn to your companion and say, \u201cWho writes this stuff?\u201d: A President and \u201cworld-class deal maker,\u201d marveled\u00a0Frida Ghitis, who demonstrates with a \u201ctemper tantrum,\u201d that he can\u2019t make deals. Who storms out of meetings with congressional leaders while\u00a0insisting he\u2019s calm (and lines up his top aides to confirm it for the cameras). Who says, \u201cI don\u2019t do cover-ups,\u201d with his administration on information lockdown \u2013 offering justifications \u201cthat wouldn\u2019t pass muster in an episode of \u2018The Simpsons,\u2019\u201d remarked\u00a0Julian Zelizer. And who launches into a tirade \u2013 in the middle of an event about aid to farmers \u2013 to say I\u2019m not crazy,\u00a0she\u2019s\u00a0crazy. \u201cShe\u201d being House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who offered Trump her thoughts and prayers, and wished aloud that someone would get him an intervention. There was no need, I\u2019m an \u201cextremely stable genius,\u201d Trump told reporters, adding that he\u2019ll talk to Democrats when they stop investigating him. He\u2019s right, suggested Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post: \u201cNancy Pelosi can\u2019t accuse him of engaging in a coverup in the morning and expect him to negotiate with her on a $2 trillion infrastructure package in the afternoon.\u201d By week\u2019s end, Trump and supporters were previewing what critics believed his re-election campaign would look like. He retweeted a Fox Business Network video mashup of Pelosi stammering during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic,\u201d protested\u00a0SE Cupp, adding \u201cchildish\u201d and \u201cimpotent.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s disgusting and disturbing to watch the president and leader of the free world do it time and time again.\u201d The war of words began Wednesday,\u00a0said Ghitis. Trump was \u201churt because earlier in the day, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0said, \u2018We believe the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\u2019\u201d Nia-Malika Henderson explained: \u201cIn Pelosi, Trump has something he has never had. A person \u2013 a woman, at that \u2013 who challenges, frustrates and frequently doles out plenty of strategic shade.\u201d Pelosi \u201creminds him that his power isn\u2019t limitless. With every briefing and White House meeting,\u00a0she flexes her own considerable power.\u201d But not toward impeachment, complained\u00a0Zelizer\u00a0\u2013and that\u2019s a big mistake. Pelosi and her allies are trying to protect \u201ctheir partisan prospects in 2020\u201d rather than ensure that \u201cour constitutional checks and balances are working to restrain Trump right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old man said he didn\u2019t do anything. I only half believed him,\u201d began retired Rear Adm.\u00a0John Kirby. He was writing about Charles Nease, an Army private who survived the Battle of Anzio in Italy during World War II \u2013 and like many in his generation didn\u2019t want to take credit for his valor.\u00a0Kirby visited him in a hospital when Nease was dying, and they talked about his love for his wife and his children. \u201cHe did everything, everything a man could hope to do with his life and still call himself a man.\u201d Memorial Day honors America\u2019s war dead, but Richard\u00a0Morgan wrote that there also needs to be an occasion to \u201chonor our forgotten fallen \u2014 the appalling number of children who have died and continue to die because our way of life.\u201d He wrote: \u201cThere is no Tomb of the Unknown Child,\u201d but thankfully, we have student advocates \u201cleading the movement for our fallen children\u2026Our prayer should be that these students succeed in schooling us.\u201d Graduates were tossing mortarboards last week and rushing to meet their futures. But it\u2019s hard to imagine a more joyous nudge than the one Robert F. Smith, a billionaire philanthropist, gave to Morehouse College\u2019s class of 2019.

Otherwise, we really have no choice but to conclude that they are telling a politically expedient lie.\u201d Trump vowed to fight every subpoena Congress delivers as it digs into the details of the Mueller probe.\u00a0One called for his former White House counsel, Don McGahn, to appear before the Judiciary Committee Tuesday.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Father Edward Beck is a Roman Catholic priest and a religion commentator for CNN. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Should voters care what political candidates believe theologically or to what faith tradition, if any, they subscribe? I don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter to me if they find spiritual inspiration in a church, synagogue, mosque, temple, ashram, Yellowstone National Park or their own house. But I do believe that political candidates, especially presidential ones, need to have the moral rectitude and ethical backbone to make wise political decisions based on compassion and the common good. Many Americans have formed their consciences and instincts toward right behavior as part of the Judeo-Christian tradition based on love of God and neighbor. Religion has provided their moral compass. Out on the presidential campaign trail, candidates have been engaging the issue of religious faith head-on. Indeed, at several recent CNN town halls, Democratic presidential candidates, such as Sens. Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, have brought up issues of morality and spoken about their faith. And at his town hall a few weeks ago, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, discussed his views, contrasting them with those of Vice President Mike Pence, who was Indiana\u2019s governor during part of Buttigieg\u2019s tenure in office. Buttigieg told the audience that his feeling \u201cis that Scripture is about protecting the stranger, and the prisoner, and the poor person, and that idea of welcome. That\u2019s what I get in the Gospel when I\u2019m in church.\u201d He said that the vice president\u2019s perspective \u201chas a lot more to do with sexuality, and, I don\u2019t know, a certain view or rectitude.\u201d A few weeks before Buttigieg made those comments, I had the opportunity to sit down with him to explore in depth his ideas about faith, religion, God and Scripture. According to a 2016 Pew Research poll, most Americans want a president to have strong religious beliefs. I wanted to know what influence religion has had in the development of this candidate\u2019s ethical and moral view of the world. Why America is starting to listen to Pete Buttigieg Of course, I make no endorsement of any candidate, but I welcomed the chance for the discussion with Buttigieg. Our interview was lengthy and wide-ranging, so it has been condensed and edited for clarity and flow. We began by talking about Buttigieg\u2019s early experience of religion. Father Edward Beck: You were baptized Roman Catholic, and your father was a Roman Catholic from Malta? Buttigieg: Malta was personally converted by St. Paul, so Catholicism is extremely deep and universal among the Maltese. My father\u2019s journey was a little complicated. He became or started to become a Jesuit. And then somewhere on the back end of that he was a leftist intellectual immigrant living in America. His experience of the \u201960s is a little murky to me. My family in Malta for the most part remains deeply religious. And I was baptized, I think more or less right away, by a theologian of science and religion at Notre Dame. Beck: I think you\u2019ve said that your father did not remain religious because your family didn\u2019t go to church much or anything like that. It was just important that you got baptized. Buttigieg: Yes, if anything my mother considers herself more religious, although she was not as likely to attend church either. Her mother was Methodist, but Mom identified more with the Anglican faith. She taught at National Cathedral School for a time, around the time my dad was a Jesuit, I think. Beck: So, the Jesuits made your father lose religion, huh? (Laughter) Buttigieg: A lot of things are blamed on the Jesuits, but I don\u2019t want to contribute to that. Pete Buttigieg: 2020 election is not just about defeating Trump Beck: Even though you didn\u2019t go to church much, you did go to a Catholic high school. Buttigieg: For me a lot of it was soaking up a tradition that I hadn\u2019t understood very well at first. I felt that many of the social teachings that I was imbibing were either very much consonant with what I believed or led on to what I was coming to believe. The teachings on justice, on what had happened around the world, learning about El Salvador, for example, in a government class, learning about Catholic commitments to human rights was very powerful because it helped me understand why many different people could overlap onto the same intuition about right and wrong. And maybe the most helpful thing of all was the instruction on Scripture. Beck: When you were a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, your encounter with religion began to change. Buttigieg: By the time I was an adult I didn\u2019t view myself as Catholic. When I began to view myself as religious was really something that happened while I was at Oxford. I had been very committed to and am very committed to Enlightenment values but \u2026 finding the humility to realize that there were forms of truth that I was not going to be accessing through reason kind of prompted me to look for more. I found myself going to services at Christ Church, which happened to be across from my college, Pembroke, at Oxford and found in that very simple liturgy a way to begin to organize my spirituality. So that by the time I came back to the US I felt like I was more-or-less Anglican. Inside Mayor Pete Buttigieg's media strategy When I got back to South Bend and was looking for a church home, I found in (the Episcopal Cathedral of) St. James this faith community that really takes seriously that it\u2019s urban, that it\u2019s part of a city. And just very quickly felt drawn to that community. And now for about 10 years it\u2019s been my faith home. So it was important for me to be married in the church. And when Chasten and I go together I think it brings us closer together.  It was a mix of faith but also of community that really made it the right place to be. And, of course, the fact that we were welcome. Beck: You describe your faith as more liturgical than theological. So does that mean that you don\u2019t consider yourself having private, individual spirituality or a life of prayer outside of that gathered community? Buttigieg: I don\u2019t know why I wound up liturgically conservative other than maybe habit, but I do feel that way. If there\u2019s going to be music, I want an organ, not a guitar. \u2026 And I\u2019ve always struggled with prayer as a concept, just because the idea that when you address the Almighty, we do it, grammatically, in the imperative mood. It\u2019s an interesting thing. Granted, in a literal sense, it\u2019s asking for things, but that\u2019s problematic, too, as though we encounter God, and he hasn\u2019t already figured out what we need. So I guess in that sense I do find that ritual organized prayer makes sense because it is a way to tune my own heart to what is right. Beck: You\u2019ve served in the military (in 2014 Buttigieg was deployed to Afghanistan for seven months). As a Christian how did you approach military service ethically and morally? Buttigieg: What I told myself at the time was that there are cases where violence is necessary in order to prevent greater violence. And I believed in our mission in the sense both that it was protective of my country, and also in the sense that it was a pretty grim thing to see what the Taliban had done and what they would do given the chance. Next US president could be youngest ever To the extent that I experienced any injury as a consequence of having been there, it was not from moments when I was afraid of being killed, as much as it was from moments when I may have participated in killing. Over time I began to realize that was the part I was having the hardest time coming to terms with. I understand why it can be necessary, but I don\u2019t think we have really, in terms of what we ask of people in the military, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really reckoned with the moral weight of what we\u2019re asking them to do \u2013 not just in terms of the physical risks they take but the moral harm that we\u2019re asking them to go through. As mayor of South Bend, Buttigieg was embroiled in the abortion debate when he vetoed a rezoning request by an anti-abortion pregnancy counseling center that wanted to establish itself adjacent to an abortion clinic. Beck: Tell me a little about that experience and why it was so volatile. Buttigieg: I understood from the outset that my responsibilities legally and ethically had to do with zoning, but nobody who was calling my office about this issue was doing it because of their views on zoning. People cared about this issue based on where they came down in the abortion debate. The problem for me was not that this organization wanted to open a seventh location in this neighborhood. It was that I was being asked to sign off on changing the zoning law over the objection of the would-be next-door neighbor \u2013 and over the objection of the (Common) Council members for that district \u2013 without seeing a compelling reason about why it absolutely had to be there. And so the council in a narrow and very bitterly divided vote, I think 5-4, voted it through, but I couldn\u2019t sign it. I just didn\u2019t think it was right. People think I did it for political reasons, which is probably the most hurtful because my political judgment told me that the simplest thing to do would be to quietly sign off and the issue would go away. Beck: What about late-term abortion? Buttigieg: Ironically, an issue like this is mostly for me about freedom from government. It is being aware that there are these incredibly painful, morally complex, but often also medically complex situations. And the question is: How do we make sure, as people navigate this in a really painful human way, that there are as few undue pressures on them as possible? Buttigieg backs Green New Deal resolution At the end of the day these are, as I understand it, measures that are designed to preserve the life and health of the mother, who is only getting to that point, I imagine, for the most part, if she had every intention of carrying a pregnancy to term. And I just don\u2019t see how my intervention as a government official, making rules about what she can and can\u2019t do, is going to help. Beck: But don\u2019t we ask government to intervene in other life issues, such as murder? Buttigieg: There are consensus issues and there are decisive issues. We demand that government intervene when we can all agree on what\u2019s at stake. The problem with this issue is that we can\u2019t all agree on what\u2019s at stake. There was a Notre Dame law student who said that birth control, abortion and infanticide are all the same thing. To me, I cannot relate to someone who views the world that way, but I get that some people do, and they think the creator of the universe wants them to think that way. Beck: You came out as gay relatively late (he was in his 30s, and in the middle of a re-election campaign). Talk about that. Buttigieg: You could rewind to when I\u2019m 12 or 13 and say it was obvious \u2013 but not to me. I desperately didn\u2019t want to be. I would have given anything. Professionally I had gravitated toward two things, political life and military service, both of which, at the time, it seemed to me were completely incompatible with being gay or, at least, with being out. Beck: What\u2019s your take on why religion finds same-sex marriage so divisive? Buttigieg: I saddens me because when I think about the blessings of marriage. First of all, it\u2019s one of the most conservative things about my life, very conventional. It is morally one of the best things in my life. Being married to Chasten makes me a better person. I would even say it moves me closer to God.  And so the idea that this of all things is what people are attacking each other over and excluding each other over, when God is love, we are taught. Of all the things to beat people up over on theological grounds, it just seems to me that loving shouldn\u2019t be one of them. So it\u2019s a painful thing to watch. I mean I get it, but. \u2026 If you believe marriage has to do with love, if also, by the way, at the risk of sounding a bit conservative, you believe that sex has to do with love, or ought to, then I think it takes you to a pretty specific place. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s an expression of love, at least it can be. And I guess I believe it ought to be. Beck: Do you see religion being weaponized sometimes as just personal agenda and to make political points? Buttigieg: Yes. And some of these things may also be believed in good faith, but I don\u2019t think that gives someone a license to harm others. I think that\u2019s where we draw the line on any freedom. The same way that we say that the right to swing your fist ends where the other one\u2019s nose begins. It is one thing to practice one\u2019s faith as one sees fit. It is another to harm somebody else in the name of that faith. We discussed Mike Pence, and Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Pence, as governor, signed into law in 2015. It allows Indiana businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense in lawsuits. Beck: Talk about that law and your view of freedom of religion \u2013 and freedom from religion. Buttigieg was asked if Pence would be better than Trump Buttigieg: (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act) appeared to me to be a license to harm others in the name of religion. \u2026 It was to me a trashing not just of our sense of freedom and our sense of rights, but also, in some way, a trashing of religion. Like is this really the biggest thing we should be doing to accommodate religion right now: making it easier to harm people in its name? Beck: It\u2019s been reported that Mike Pence believes that at this moment in history God wants him to be vice president and (Donald) Trump President. Buttigieg: The section in my book about Mike Pence begins with that quote from Lincoln where he says, \u201cBoth sides in great contests invoke God, think and hope that God\u2019s on their side. Both may be, and one must be, wrong.\u201d The idea that God wants somebody like Mike Pence to be the cheerleader for a President largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give God very little credit.  Beck: Tell me about the death of your father and its impact on you. (Buttigieg\u2019s father, Joseph, died in January.) Buttigieg: (Long pause) Well, it\u2019s very recent so I\u2019m still kind of working through that. (Pause.) I don\u2019t yet know how religion will help me make sense of my relationship with my father or his death, other than, of course, the fact that it holds out the hope of some form of unity or reunification. We never really understand our relationships with the dead any better than we understand our relationships with the living. They\u2019re complicated and they\u2019re evolving, they\u2019re confusing, but they\u2019re probably the better part of who we are.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Danielle Campoamor is an editor at Romper and a columnist for Bustle. She received an award from Planned Parenthood for media excellence. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinions on CNN. In an attempt to keep one of his many outlandish campaign promises, the so-called most \u201cpro-life\u201d president has cemented his willingness to attack the millions of people who obtain confidential and affordable health care via Title X, the federal program that provides millions of low-income Americans with birth control and other reproductive health services. On Friday, the Trump administration unveiled the US Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 final version of its new Title X regulations. The revised directive would ban any health care clinics that perform abortions or refer patients to abortion providers from receiving federal funds. The final rule for Title X will go into effect 60 days after it\u2019s published in the Federal Register. Title X is the only US federal grant program dedicated to expanding access to birth control and comprehensive reproductive health care. According to the Guttmacher Institute, Title X patients are \u201cdisproportionately low-income, one-third are people of color, and one in 10 have limited English proficiency.\u201d By stripping federal funding from health care facilities that provide comprehensive reproductive care that includes abortion and medically accurate information about abortion, this administration is hurting the most vulnerable among us, putting American families in danger and silencing doctors, while inhibiting them from providing the best care to their patients, all in the name of political ideology. The Hyde Amendment, passed in 1976, already blocks federal funds from paying for abortion services, with exceptions for cases of rape or when a person\u2019s life is in danger, so this administration\u2019s proposed update to Title X is redundant and unnecessary: there are zero tax-payer dollars paying for abortion care in this country. They had abortions late in their pregnancies. These are their stories Instead, the rule makes it increasingly more difficult for low-income people to procure birth control, prenatal care, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, cancer screenings, and emergency contraception, especially from Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest provider of reproductive health care and sex education. According to Planned Parenthood\u2019s 2017-2018 annual report, the health care clinic provided almost 300,000 breast exams, detected roughly 70,000 cancers or abnormalities, served almost 1.9 million birth control clients, provided over 600,000 emergency contraception kits, conducted over 700,000 HIV tests, and diagnosed 240,000 STIs. Stripping Planned Parenthood of its Title X funding simply because it also provides abortion care in the same clinics from which it provides birth control, STI testing, and cancer screenings limits the number of people who can receive vital reproductive health care services. But what\u2019s more insidious is what this update to Title X does to the relationship between health care providers and their patients. Under this revised language \u2013 what advocates have deemed the \u201cdomestic gag rule\u201d \u2013 doctors who work at clinics that receive Title X funds are prohibited from mentioning the option of abortion to their patients or referring their patients to clinics that provide abortion care. It\u2019s a manifestation on American soil of the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d (also called the Mexico City policy), which Trump reinstated in one of his first acts as president, and which prevents foreign organizations receiving US government funding or assistance from providing abortion referrals, information or services. Trump administration inches closer to defunding Planned Parenthood This new Title X rule mandates that in the US, \u201call pregnant patients at Title X sites be referred for prenatal and social services (such as infant or foster care or adoption) regardless of their wishes.\u201d Meanwhile, there are 28 states that mandate OB-GYNs lie to their patients about abortion, requiring counseling directives that are often written by anti-choice politicians and not medical professionals. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 11 states require doctors to give their patients pamphlets highlighting the so-called \u201crisks\u201d of abortion care, including widely debunked claims that abortion causes breast cancer or infertility. Yes, in the United States of America, where we have a Constitution that endows us with and protects our freedom of speech, the government is dictating what doctors tell their patients \u2013 and putting the health of low-income Americans on the line. By muzzling health care providers and stifling clinics from providing essential reproductive health care, this administration is unabashedly attacking the rights of poor people, people of color, immigrants, and low-income families. According to the United Nations Population Fund, \u201caccess to quality sexual and reproductive health care, including voluntary family planning, can reduce maternal deaths by one third, and child deaths by as much as one fifth.\u201d Planned Parenthood president: What gives me hope Curtailing affordable access to reproductive health runs antithetical to what Trump claims to be his most important job: protecting the American people. Make no mistake, there is no \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u201d without the ability to access health care that enables you to make your own personal medical decisions. So when the government is willing to snuff out science and silence doctors, we have less of a democracy and more of a dictatorship. When the majority of this country supports access to abortion care, yet the government continues to attack it at state or federal levels, the will of the people is being categorically ignored. According to new state-by-state polling data from Gallup, if the 2020 election was held today, President Trump would lose. So he and his administration are relying on a tried and true Republican technique: attacking abortion rights to appease their base. But this attack on clinics like Planned Parenthood and the people who rely on them for care \u2013 coupled with the administration\u2019s push for \u201cabstinence-only\u201d sex education and this President\u2019s incendiary rhetoric and flat-out lies about second- and third-trimester abortions \u2013 proves that regardless of whether he truly embraces this ideology, there\u2019s nothing he won\u2019t do to remain in a position of power.  Dictating what information doctors can give to their patients is inherently un-American. Attacking poor people\u2019s access to health care is disgustingly un-American. Making it harder for people to make their own private, personal health care decisions is undeniably un-American.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Dr. Leana S. Wen is an emergency physician and the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. The views expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion at CNN. On Thursday, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that would require a doctor to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where she performs an abortion. This is a law that has no basis in medicine. Abortions are safe. According to a 2012 report from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, abortion has more than a 99% safety record for every 100,000 procedures performed. Other outpatient procedures that are this safe are not legislated this way. This law could result in the entire state of Louisiana having only one health center serving women with the full range of reproductive health care. While Chief Justice John Roberts was one of the five members of the court who voted to block the law, more than a dozen other cases are one step from the Supreme Court and could end up eroding the protections provided by Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 ruling, which affirms that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion, is under threat. And if it were overturned, 25 million women \u2013 or one in every three of reproductive age \u2013 could be living in a state without access, according to research conducted by Planned Parenthood with the organization In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda. That appears to be President Donald Trump\u2019s goal. I sat in the balcony of the House chamber during last week\u2019s State of the Union address, angry and disgusted as he called for Congress to pass laws restricting safe, legal abortion and criticized state legislation that seeks to protect access to health care. He doubled down at a campaign rally Monday night where he continued lying to the American people, scaring viewers, and shaming women and their families. I won\u2019t repeat what he said because it\u2019s deliberately misleading and designed to be manipulative. I\u2019m a doctor and the president of the leading provider of reproductive health care in the country: It\u2019s my obligation to state the facts. What the Louisiana abortion ruling tells us about the fate of Roe v. Wade Fact No. 1: Abortion is a safe and legal medical procedure that is also very common. Based on research from 2014, one in four American women will have one by the age of 45. It\u2019s part of the full spectrum of reproductive health care and shouldn\u2019t be treated any differently than other medical procedures. Fact No. 2: About 99% of abortions take place before 21 weeks. Abortions that occur late in pregnancy are often due to extreme, extenuating circumstances such as when a woman\u2019s life is in danger, when there has been a severe fetal diagnosis, or when the pregnancy is not viable. As a doctor, I have treated women in many different circumstances. I had a patient who found out in her second trimester that the twins she was carrying were missing their diaphragms and would never develop their lungs. If she\u2019d carried them to term, they would have suffocated upon birth. She made a deeply personal, deeply painful, and deeply difficult decision to end her pregnancy. My job as the doctor is to provide my patients with the information and services they need to make the best decisions for them and their families. Medicine is complex, and every situation is different. It\u2019s my job to guide and support my patients in their time of need. I trust my patients; I trust women. These are extremely difficult decisions that need to be made by the patient, in consultation with her doctor. Politicians should not be making personal medical decisions for other people. Before judging 'late-term abortion,' understand what it means, doctors say Fact No. 3: In his speech, President Trump used emotionally charged and medically inaccurate language to mischaracterize bills in New York and Virginia. Let\u2019s look at factual information about these two pieces of legislation. The bill introduced in Virginia, which has been set aside in committee, would repeal restrictions to abortion access, including a 24-hour waiting period and the requirement that three doctors sign off on abortions later in pregnancy. There are no medical reasons for these restrictions. Waiting periods have no basis in medicine; they are an attempt to judge, shame, and coerce patients. And the three-doctor sign-off would place an unfair burden on patients with potentially life-threatening emergencies. As an ER doctor, I know that when a woman\u2019s health or life is in danger in the middle of the night, it\u2019s hard to find three doctors to come in to see the patient, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Last month, on the 46th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act, which protects access to abortions at the state level even if the historic decision is overturned, and removes abortion from the criminal code. In addition, states across the country are introducing more legislation to repeal restrictions. In New Mexico, the state House of Representatives voted last Wednesday to repeal a law that made it a fourth-degree felony for a doctor to perform an abortion in the state. These efforts are an attempt to make sure women have access to the best medical care available. Unfortunately, since 2011 we have seen more than 400 restrictions placed on abortion, including making it a felony to perform an abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks and often before most women even know they\u2019re pregnant. Despite this, support for Roe v. Wade as the law of the land has never been higher. Recent polling from PerryUndem, a public opinion research firm, shows 73% of voters said they do not want the decision overturned. Voters across the country gave elected officials a mandate in the last election to protect and expand access to reproductive health care \u2014 including the right to safe, legal abortion. Seven state legislative chambers flipped to pro-reproductive health majorities, and Kansas, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota joined the 21 other states with governors who support reproductive health. Voters in red and purple states like Idaho, Nebraska and Utah voted to expand Medicaid. The American people have made it clear they want more health care, not less, and that they understand what we in medicine know to be true: that reproductive health care and women\u2019s health care is health care.  Given the threat to Roe v. Wade, states are a critical backstop, which is why reproductive health care champions are stepping up to pass state legislation that expands access to safe and legal abortions. We\u2019re already celebrating victories, but we\u2019re not stopping until every person in this country has access to the care they need. There was one thing that gave me hope during President Trump\u2019s speech. I looked out at the newly elected House of Representatives \u2013 the most female, most diverse, and most strongly pro-reproductive health majority in the House in our country\u2019s most recent history. I am honored to be in this fight with them, providing, protecting and expanding reproductive health care for people across the country, even in the face of lies and relentless attacks from the highest office of this land. Planned Parenthood was founded on the ideal that your body is your own, and without that you can never be truly free or equal. For over 100 years we have fought to uphold those values, and today is no different. The stakes are as high as ever, and the cost is women\u2019s lives. Together with our elected officials and our 12 million supporters, we will continue to fight for our patients \u2013 in the courts, in each state, at the ballot box, and in the White House \u2013 through every means possible, so that we can continue providing health care, no matter what.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: James Piltch\u2019s writing on civic life and education has appeared in The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and The Chronicle of Higher Education.  He is David Gergen\u2019s chief research assistant. David Gergen has been a White House adviser to four presidents and is a senior political analyst at CNN. A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. The opinions expressed in this commentary belong to the authors. View more opinion on CNN. As Nancy Pelosi takes charge of the House of Representatives, she is making history in more ways than one. Not only is she the first woman to be elected speaker of the House in two stints; not only has she stood up successfully to President Trump in the Oval Office with cameras whirring; not only did she deftly compromise with dissidents in her ranks in order to retain power. Nancy Pelosi is also the woman now at the forefront of a potential revolution in American politics. Despite her unpopularity in GOP districts around the country, Pelosi has become the central player in an unfolding drama, the plot of which centers around one question: Whether the flood of new women into Congress this year can begin the renewal of the badly broken political system that is increasingly holding back the country. Since the election of Donald Trump, women of all ages and backgrounds have become more civically engaged, especially on the Democratic side. In the 2015-2016 political cycle, for example, fewer than 1,000 women called Emily\u2019s List, an organization that seeks to elect Democratic women to office, for help in launching political bids from city halls to Congress. In 2018, more than 40,000 called Emily\u2019s List interested in a political run. It cannot be stressed enough that, so far, Democratic women have been winning many more elections than Republican women. Indeed, Democratic women have increased their numbers in the House from 64 two years ago to 89 today, while the number of Republican women has decreased from 23 to 13. Smart Republicans are now scrambling to have more women join the parade. Regardless of the paltry GOP representation, the fact is that women across the nation are opening the door wide so more of their numbers can, in the words of \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cbe in the room where it happens.\u201d Their arrival is welcome news for the future of politics. Social science studies and public polling over the past several years indicate that women being in these halls of political power will likely bring positive changes in governance. In fact, a large increase in female leaders could be a saving grace for the country\u2019s hyperpolarized, venomous politics. They may just be better at leading than men. Barbara Kellerman, a faculty member at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author of several books on leadership, writes about effective leadership as a system in which the strengths of leaders, the needs of followers, and the demands of context all align properly. At this moment, women in leadership roles fit extremely well with the country\u2019s needs. Valerie Jarrett: Nancy Pelosi has the toughness Democrats need When it comes to the respective leadership strengths of different genders, it\u2019s hard to be sure what is absolutely, verifiably true. But research suggests women possess two leadership qualities that our country needs right now. In her book, \u201cWomen in the Club,\u201d Georgetown University professor Michele Swers explains that women are able to influence change in oft-ignored policy arenas. She writes, \u201cWomen are able to leverage their gender to influence policy debates on a range of issues from health care and education to abortion rights and pay equity.\u201d But women in public office don\u2019t just bring needed attention to these issues. They also have distinct enough experiences from men that female elected officials bring new ideas on how to fix problems in essentially every realm, from foreign policy to the economy. Given the gridlock slowing down Washington, the looming threat of climate change, and an economy at risk of tanking, all of which place stress on Americans and their families, fresh ideas and a new agenda are critical for correcting the current government malaise. As critical as new policies are, the country needs more than just ideas. It needs elected officials who will rebuild faith in government. Fortunately, women tend to bring something as leaders that is sorely lacking in Washington: Ethics and integrity. Alice Eagly writes in \u201cThrough the Labyrinth\u201d that women are seemingly less likely to encourage unethical practices when on corporate boards or other positions of leadership than men. Although research confirming Eagly\u2019s findings remains limited, people who work with women who lead agree that they are more likely to be ethical and honest than men. A 2012 study by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman, published in the Harvard Business Review, found that employees of female leaders rate the average female leader significantly higher than the average male leader when asked to what degree the leaders display \u201chigh integrity and honesty.\u201d The next Abraham Lincoln will be a woman While the context in Washington is ripe for the strengths that female leaders would bring, the same question that has long held female leadership back remains: Is the electorate ready for women to lead? The recent election and polling suggest that Americans now want what they believe women bring to the table. Pew reports that 61% of Americans believe women are more likely to be compassionate and empathetic as political leaders. It also found that Americans overwhelmingly believe female leaders are more likely to stand up for what they believe in and do so in a civil way than male leaders. Americans\u2019 faith  in female leadership is critically important given people\u2019s lack of trust in government. Electing women, then, seems like a logical first step toward restoring that trust. The context, followers and leaders seem to have aligned. However, Pew also found Americans hold a lingering stereotype that might prevent them from voting for women: They believe women are less willing to take necessary risks compared to men. But this stereotype is inaccurate, as recent events have shown. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has fearlessly led in Europe, often making decisions that were politically unpopular, including allowing millions of migrants into the country. Sen. Lisa Murkowski just months ago proved willing to risk her political standing to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Most recently, Pelosi proved herself as risk-taking and strategic as any politician these last few weeks in her showdowns with the President and members of her own party.  Social science and national need suggest this new class of women in Congress \u2013 which will be the largest in history \u2013 should be just the beginning of a new political movement. Looking toward the future, there\u2019s one last finding from the Zenger and Folkman study that might be relevant to Democrat voters and leaders come February 2020 when the presidential primary begins: The closer men and women get to the highest levels of power, the more their employees believe women are better leaders than men.",

            "article_content": "A half century after Curt Flood\u2019s defiance paved the way for free agency in professional sports, his surviving children are lobbying for their once-estranged father\u2019s induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. \u201cMy dad lost his health and his way,\u201d said Curt Flood Jr., who\u2019s 59. \u201cIt was a long road back and, just as he was coming full circle and being of service to his community and young ball players, he became ill with throat cancer and died at the same age I am today.\u201d On Christmas Eve 1969, the former All-Star center fielder for the St. Louis Cardinals wrote a brief but momentous letter to then Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn challenging the league\u2019s stranglehold over its players. \u201cAfter 12 years in the Major Leagues, I do not feel that I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes,\u201d the letter read in part, with Flood not accepting his team\u2019s right to trade him to the Philadelphia Phillies. His rejection of the reserve clause was the advent of free agency, which gave professional baseball players more control over their careers and allowed them to reap the massive contracts many players receive today. It also effectively ended Flood\u2019s career, leaving him a broken man. He drifted apart from his five children and battled alcoholism and money problems. He was shunned by MLB, sports writers and even former teammates. \u201cHe had been ostracized by the game he loved,\u201d said daughter Shelly Flood, 58, a drug and alcohol youth counselor in Los Angeles. Now, nearly 23 years after his death in January 1997, Flood\u2019s children and others are heralding what they call his heroic sacrifice in a push for his enshrinement in Cooperstown, New York. \u201cIf Cooperstown is the place where the history is kept, then in the absence of Curt Flood \u2026 there\u2019s a continuity issue,\u201d his son said. Flood\u2019s surviving children are behind a lobbying campaign to spread the word about his legacy to professional athletes and their unions, sports agents, entertainment figures, journalists and younger fans not familiar with his story. Flood is already in the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame and the Cardinals Hall of Fame. He can be inducted to the Hall of Fame only through its Golden Days era committee, which meets every five years. The panel of HOF members, executives and veteran media members selects players or figures from 1950 to 1969 who are no longer eligible for regular induction. It meets in December 2020 to vote on inductees for the following year. On Christmas Day, former tennis star Martina Navratilova tweeted her support. \u201cNo doubt Curt Flood should be a Hall of Famer- I assumed he was there already. Do the right thing #MLB,\u201d she wrote. 50 years ago yesterday, Curt Flood declared himself to be an #MLB free agent. His letter would lead to a Supreme Court case and prove to be a major milestone in the development of free agency in pro\u00a0sports. Curt belongs in the Hall of Fame. https://t.co/zpkw4ohPIh That same day, Billie Jean King tweeted: \u201c50 years ago yesterday, Curt Flood declared himself to be an #MLB free agent. His letter would lead to a Supreme Court case and prove to be a major milestone in the development of free agency in pro sports. Curt belongs in the Hall of Fame.\u201d Supporters point to the Hall of Fame election earlier this month of Marvin Miller, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players\u2019 Association, as well as the union\u2019s attorney when the Flood stood up to MLB. Miller backed Flood\u2019s historic challenge of the reserve clause, which essentially tied players to their team forever. After living through Jim Crow discrimination while playing in the minors in the 1950s, Flood fought being traded to Philadelphia without his consent. Miller, a longtime thorn in MLB\u2019s side, died in 2012. Sportswriters at the time scoffed at Flood\u2019s assertion the reserve clause enslaved him. Sportscaster Howard Cosell once asked Flood how someone earning $90,000 a year \u2013 one of the top salaries in the game then \u2013 could feel like a slave. \u201cA well-paid slave is nonetheless a slave,\u201d he responded. Flood\u2019s legal case is considered a turning point in the union\u2019s move to eliminate the reserve clause. In 1970, management agreed to an independent arbitrator to settle future disputes with the union as Flood\u2019s suit moved through the courts. Despite Flood\u2019s legal defeat in a  case that reached the US Supreme Court, Miller forged ahead. The reserve clause was finally thrown out by the arbitrator on December 23, 1975. \u201cToday free agency is on the lips of everybody,\u201d Shelly Flood said. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of common conversation.\u201d When pitching ace Gerrit Cole put on a New York Yankees jersey this month for the official announcement of his $324 million contract, he thanked Miller and Flood and \u201call the players that have sacrificed for us to get in this position.\u201d \u201cA lot of people are saying his name,\u201d Shelly Flood said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a question on Jeopardy, everybody knows.\u201dStill, Flood\u2019s son and daughter recall a flawed human, not just a man known for courageous resistance, two World Series titles or three All-Star Game appearances. After his first marriage, with two adopted children, two of his own and his wife pregnant, Flood leased a ranch-style house in an all-white California suburb outside of Oakland. But the property owner barricaded himself in the house with a shotgun after learning the Flood family was black, according to Flood\u2019s son. Flood sued and his family took possession of the home with an escort of US marshals. \u201cIt was all on TV,\u201d Curt Flood Jr. said of the incident after the 1964 World Series, calling it the beginning of his father \u201cresolving horrible situations\u201d with court intervention. Flood\u2019s marriage to his first wife, Beverly Collins, fell apart and they divorced in 1966. The family moved to Los Angeles about a year later. Collins later remarried an entertainment lawyer. Curt Flood Jr. and his brother visited their father at spring training in 1968. \u201cHe was always gone,\u201d Shelly Flood said in a phone interview. \u201cHe was a baseball player. His life was in St. Louis. He had businesses there. He was a part of the St. Louis fabric whereas we were in California. When he was working, he was in St. Louis. When he was off season, he was still maintaining what he had there even though we were here.\u201d In 1969, when she was about eight, her father walked away from the game forever. \u201cI remember the hush-hush talk about what was going on,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole program changed in terms of no longer being able to walk home from school. I had to be picked up because there had been threats against my father and his family.\u201d Flood sat out the 1970 season. He was 32 then. He played his final 13 games in 1972 for the Washington Senators before retiring. That same year he said goodbye to his children and moved to Europe, living in Spain and Denmark until about 1978, according to his son and daughter. Curt Flood Jr. said his father stopped by their home. Their mother had remarried and they lived in big house with a swimming pool in an affluent neighborhood. \u201cI think that kind of bruised him,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a sense that we didn\u2019t need him anymore. That was a breaking point with his spirit. He wasn\u2019t the greatest dad anyway in terms of being there and being present.\u201d Flood took the children to a toy store and asked them to get whatever they wanted. He did the same when he returned from Europe a few years later. \u201cHe was a perpetual giver of gifts,\u201d Curt Flood Jr. said. \u201cOnly he can say why he did that,\u201d Shelly Flood said of the store visits. \u201cFor a kid, it was for every disappointment. Every Christmas missed. Every birthday missed. This is how he had to do it.\u201d She added, \u201cWhen he came back from Europe, he was fragile and empty and probably scared and starting over.\u201d Curt Flood Jr. said his father took him bowling about a year after returning to America and unexpectedly gave his son his World Series ring. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 \u201d Curt Flood Jr. recalled. \u201cThere was no pomp and circumstance. It wasn\u2019t ceremonial. He just handed it to me across the table and we continued to bowl.\u201d Curt Flood married actress Judy Pace in 1986. They were married when he died in 1997. He was still trying to get closer to his children. \u201cWe had begun to try to mend the fence and our relationships individually,\u201d his son said.  \u201cWe each tried to make sense of the circumstances surrounding what happened. We tried to forgive and hopefully learn from it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed to this report.",

Samantha did, too. \u201cIt\u2019s all so surreal,\u201d Samantha says now. \u201cYou\u2019re literally standing there, going, \u2018I\u2019m at a book burning at someone\u2019s house. Like, there are families that live next door. There\u2019s probably a nice person who lives across the street, and I\u2019m burning books about Jewish people.\u2019 \u2026 It doesn\u2019t even feel like it\u2019s wrong or right. It just feels unreal.\u201d At the time, she texted a friend that it was the best weekend of her life. It had taken Samantha six months to go from a vaguely liberal non-voter to what she calls \u201ca productive racist.\u201d She is one of very few women who joined the alt-right, and an even smaller number who left and are willing to talk about it. Her story helps explain what draws people into this movement, and the misogyny that drives it. In the fall of 2016, Samantha\u2019s indie-rock-loving boyfriend changed. He started lifting weights and making jokes she didn\u2019t understand. When she finally Googled them, she discovered they were based on an elaborate, violent, white supremacist fantasy called the \u201cDay of the Rope,\u201d in which people of color, Jews, gays and the \u201crace traitors\u201d who helped them, are murdered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cWe both knew so many people that fit that description.\u201d Her boyfriend reassured her they were just jokes. But then, she says, he looked her in the eye and said that he was a fascist, and that he couldn\u2019t be with anyone who wasn\u2019t. She started researching the alt-right \u2013 a movement that shaped old white supremacist ideas into ironic memes that spread online to a very young audience. The grotesque jokes on imageboards such as 4chan and 8chan were not her scene. But she found something appealing in the white power activists who presented themselves as intellectuals, like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor. Just a few weeks after her first online search, she became a dues-paying member of a white power fraternity called Identity Evropa. That took her into the organization\u2019s chatrooms on Discord, where some members spread similar messages to the ones that had shocked her not long before. \u201cLike it starts as a joke where you laugh nervously. Then you kind of stop laughing, \u2018cause you\u2019re used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then you start to post it yourself, because you want to be a part of that. And it\u2019s this really quick, quick descension into that.\u201d Samantha, now 29, was open about her past in her interviews with CNN, but asked that her last name not be used to protect her and her family from possible violence or retribution. She now rejects white supremacy, and has joined Life After Hate, an organization that helps people leave hate groups. CNN knows the identities of the men Samantha and other women we spoke to had close relationships with. We have verified their real names, locations and, in one case, criminal records through contemporaneous messages and public records. The women asked us not to use their names, because they\u2019re afraid of those men and their followers. Samantha has spoken out before. In 2018, she contacted Andrew Marantz, who was working on a book about social media and extremism that published this fall as \u201cAnti-Social.\u201d Marantz later reached out to me, and suggested I talk to Samantha. He gave me the iPhone she\u2019d used during her time in the alt right. The screen was shattered. I had it fixed and began looking through it. Samantha\u2019s iPhone opens up the hidden world inside the white power movement, frozen in time in 2017. And once Samantha was in, she was all the way in. She became an interviewer for Identity Evropa, testing whether new applicants were fluent in white power ideology and screening out Jews and people of color. She told herself that she wasn\u2019t racist, just \u201cpro-white.\u201d She rose in the organization past her boyfriend, and they broke up. She was named women\u2019s coordinator for IE, and ran a women\u2019s chatroom, an essential organizing tool in a movement that\u2019s almost entirely online. Samantha changed her look and her demeanor. She bought dresses with full skirts and nipped-in waists, clothes with which she wanted to project an \u201call-American, delicate sexuality.\u201d Samantha said, \u201cI wanted to be more feminine, I wanted to be more desirable, I wanted to be more appreciated, I wanted to feel smart. So I just played into these roles. And the standards for how women are treated in there are pretty low, so I was able to lean into that and make that work for me.\u201d A photo from that time shows Samantha smiling demurely in a white dress, flanked by five white men, four of them wearing white polos with the Identity Evropa logo. It was mid-May 2017, and Samantha had helped plan a protest now known within the white power movement as \u201cCharlottesville 1.0.\u201d During the day, a few dozen protesters gave speeches by the Robert E Lee memorial in the Virginia city. At night, they stood and chanted with tiki torches. Samantha had picked the rural rental where she and other IE members stayed. It was a cabin on a winery, with two bedrooms and a deck with an extra dining area. \u201cI thought it would be funny if [anti-fascist activists] wanted to chase us out of town\u2026 you know like, \u2018Oh these big scary Nazis retreated to a vineyard.\u2019 I thought it would be profoundly ironic.\u201d Charlottesville rally violence: How we got here There wasn\u2019t much interest from the mainstream media, or violence at the rally. But the images the rallygoers posted on social media were dramatic, and they inspired the Unite the Right rally now often referred to as \u201cCharlottesville\u201d three months later, where a counterprotester was killed and two state troopers patrolling near the site of clashes died in a helicopter crash. \u201cAfter that I was in,\u201d she says. \u201cI was in the movement. It felt so good to be an activist, to be in the movement.\u201d A couple weeks after the gathering in May, she was taken to the book-burning by a rising leader within Identity Evropa who was trying to impress her by introducing her to white supremacist \u201ccelebrities.\u201d The party was hosted by men associated with The Right Stuff, a group that makes podcasts that are something like drive-time radio shows obsessed with race science. It was attended by Richard Spencer, who gained national notoriety when he declared \u201cHail Trump\u201d to a crowd doing Nazi salutes shortly after the 2016 election. There was an array of other men most people have never heard of but who are famous in the racist podcasting world. Samantha filmed one of them throwing a book into the fire. Spencer told CNN: \u201cI don\u2019t remember the event.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve been to lots of parties and seen plenty of wild stuff.\u201d When CNN talked to The Right Stuff\u2019s Mike \u201cEnoch\u201d Peinovich, he declined to comment on the book burning. \u201cThe people that you hear on the podcasts, and people that you see making the speeches, and going on different news shows, are showing up at these parties. So you feel like you\u2019re meeting a rock star,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cIt also encourages you to stay, incentivizes you to stick around. You could be the next big name in the movement if you meet the right person.\u201d Even as Samantha thought she was rising through the ranks, she was aware of a meme known as white sharia, a misogynistic twist on Muslim religious code. The \u201cjoke\u201d is that white women are ruining Western civilization through promiscuity and voting for liberals, so the only way to save it is to impose Sharia law on women and, in the supremacists\u2019 twisted view of Sharia, treat them like property. A flyer at the book-burning said \u201cWHITE SHARIA ZONE. THOTS MUST WEAR HIJAB AT ALL TIMES.\u201d (A \u201cthot\u201d is slang racists have enthusiastically ripped from hip-hop; it means \u201cthat ho over there,\u201d or a woman who seeks attention through her sexuality.) Samantha took a picture of it. She is holding it with French-manicured fingernails. Shortly after the party, one of several that summer, Samantha\u2019s new boyfriend was doxxed. His personal information was published online and he was afraid anti-fascist activists would come to his house, so Samantha offered to let him crash at her place. He never left. She worked long hours to support him, and the relationship soured. They broke up privately, but she agreed to pretend to be his girlfriend publicly. And she was still working for IE, growing women\u2019s membership from a handful to about 50, as the overall ranks swelled to 1,000, she said. In the chat rooms, her prot\u00e9g\u00e9es signaled they were happy. One wrote, \u201cI finally got over the whole woman issue. Cause I was real sensitive guys come across kind of mean on podcasts or twitter \u2026 But IRL all super nice. So there is a social media bravado I don\u2019t get but learned to accept.\u201d Another said, \u201cYeah, initially it was the whole white sharia, women are property, women aren\u2019t people, etc. that really got to me. I\u2019ve met a few men that are hardcore white sharia/women shouldn\u2019t be intellectual, but they are the minority of men I know.\u201d In private, they texted her about the men who harassed or abused them. Samantha was getting frustrated and bored. She vented to an IE leader that she was doing the work a male interviewer was getting credit for. \u201cI know that I\u2019ll never be in leadership like that because I\u2019m a woman. So if I do it behind the scenes with someone else\u2019s voice, that\u2019s fine,\u201d she told him. As others prepared to head back to Charlottesville, Samantha\u2019s commitment was cracking. She watched as an older woman, who was established in the movement, posed a hypothetical during a conversation with a white man who didn\u2019t know they were white supremacists. She asked him to imagine a house was on fire and 10 people were inside, five of them black and five white. He could only save five. Wouldn\u2019t he save the white people first? The man said he would save whomever he could reach. Samantha thought, \u2018That\u2019s what I would do, too.\u2019 But she didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI felt like most of the time I was in there, I was waiting for someone else to say, \u2018We know this is all bullsh*t, right?\u2019\u201d Other women who had spent time with Identity Evropa told CNN the violence at Charlottesville horrified them and drove them away, but Samantha\u2019s breaking point came that October, when her grandmother died. She felt ashamed that her grandmother could not be proud of her. She quit IE a few weeks later. She says her ex threatened her \u2013 saying in the good ole days she would have left the movement \u201cin a body bag.\u201d She says she was reminded she could hold \u201ca lot of Nazi semen\u201d and make many Nazi babies. Despite those threats, she left. White supremacists increase recruiting efforts at colleges, ADL says Identity Evropa has since rebranded as the American Identity Movement, to distance itself from the alt-right. When asked for comment about the claims about IE members, AIM president Patrick Casey said he is \u201cunaware of anyone being coerced to stay in the organization.\u201d The group promotes itself as \u201cidentitarian,\u201d that white people should preserve their racial and cultural identity. It is responsible for more than a third of white supremacist propaganda posted on college campuses in the 2018-19 academic year, according to a tally from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which tracks and campaigns against hate. The American Identity Movement says it prohibits violence and illegal activity. By December 2017, Samantha says she quit all the chat rooms.  She lived in a cabin in the woods for some time, and slowly came to terms with what she\u2019d done. She eventually stopped making excuses and realized she had actively promoted racism. She says, \u201cI was definitely a bad person, for a while.\u201d CNN spoke to two other women who, like Samantha, spent about a year in the alt-right before quitting, unable to take the abuse anymore and fearing for their safety. They now reject their old beliefs. One had become interested in the movement after watching a speech Spencer gave at Texas A&M in late 2016. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even a racist yet. I thought he made a really good argument for families,\u201d she told CNN, requesting anonymity because she fears violence. \u201cHe\u2019s good at making it sound legitimate.\u201d She liked \u201cthe family security, the promise of\u2026 whatever they\u2019re promising. Safety. It\u2019s very appealing.\u201d This woman also joined IE and began dating a man she met in the movement. Her boyfriend\u2019s view, she says, was, \u201c\u2018Women deserve to be subjugated. Women deserve to be humiliated. Women deserve to be raped. Women deserve to be impregnated.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a joke. \u2026 I can\u2019t believe I supported that stuff.\u201d She explains, \u201cI thought I was trash, so I didn\u2019t mind when they talked about women being dogs, worthless. Even though I was the one driving them around, paying for stuff.\u201d She says that she and Samantha fit a familiar pattern within the alt-right. \u201cLike 70 percent of the time, the women earn the money and the men do podcasts. And they do podcasts about how women shouldn\u2019t have jobs.\u201d She broke away only after the relationship ended. \u201cI was so wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI would talk to younger women about how this was a great way to be family-oriented, and joke about white sharia. I thought we were there to serve men. I thought we were stupid. I didn\u2019t look in the mirror to see what was real.\u201d A third woman, who was interviewed for Identity Evropa by Samantha, took on some of the counseling roles Samantha left behind when she quit. It was then that she saw the harm being done to the psyche of other women. \u201cThere was one particular girl that would call me at all hours of the day when she had panic attacks from all the verbal abuse in her relationship. She hadn\u2019t eaten in days,\u201d she told CNN, asking for anonymity to avoid any reprisals. Eventually, she said she sent a resignation letter to IE. \u201cIt was unconscionable for me to justify creating manipulative content to draw young women into an organization where they were going to alienate themselves from friends and family and open themselves up to predatory men,\u201d she said. The alt-right is far more hostile to women than previous iterations of the white supremacy movement, Jessica Reaves, a researcher for the ADL, told CNN. The alt-right emerged from the same parts of the internet as violently misogynist groups like incels, or involuntarily celibate men. She says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s even possible to have an alt-right movement without the underlying misogyny.\u201d Women recruiters in these movements are caught in a \u201creally toxic stew of misogyny and self-loathing,\u201d Reaves says. But at the same time, they\u2019re morally implicated. A mother's warning: If you have white teen sons, listen up ... \u201cThey are bringing women into a movement that is at its heart, fundamentally misogynistic, which is dangerous in and of itself, but they\u2019re also bringing women in who are supporting a movement that is, you know, geared toward the annihilation of non-white people, or the very least the segregation of white people from non-white people,\u201d Reaves said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that they\u2019re going to have to reckon with.\u201d Samantha and her former IE friend both say the alt-right was like a cult, in that it separated people from their families and friends and demanded total ideological adherence. \u201cLike any cult, they want to expose you to as much as they can, but not so much you just turn away,\u201d the woman said. The one difference is that there\u2019s no single leader who dictates the culture and doctrine. Instead that\u2019s created and enforced by largely anonymous people on message boards and in chat rooms, each one trying to one-up the others by posting more cleverly racist and cruel jokes. \u201cIt never was past me that this stuff was dark,\u201d Samantha says. \u201cYou become so numb to it\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I ever thought it was funny. I don\u2019t know if I ever explicitly said it wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d She scrolled through her old phone, looking at the pictures and text messages and Nazi memes that had been sent to her, evidence of her past life \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to move past it and be like, \u2018I was trash. I had ideas that I absolutely no longer agree with.\u2019 It\u2019s another thing entirely to confront the actual information and, like, proof. \u2026 And then to know that in some way it might never go away.\u201d",

Twenty-two years ago today Hong Kong was handed over to China by the British. Protesters marked the anniversary by trying to smash their way into Hong Kong\u2019s government headquarters. Young, masked protesters used metal bars and trolleys as battering rams to try to break the doors of headquarters as riot police watched from the inside.

Britain should know\u00a0who its next prime minister will be soon. The results of the Conservative party leader election will be announced later today. The winner of that race will not only lead the party but\u00a0also replace Theresa May as prime minister. Pro-Brexit firebrand Boris Johnson is the favorite to win the job.

Officials are blaming it on a hostile \u201celectromagnetic attack,\u201d but the exact cause of the outage remains unclear at this point. Power was restored to Caracas early this morning, the government said. The outages are exacerbating\u00a0a broader political crisis that has gripped the country for years. Runaway inflation and food scarcity has crippled Venezuela, with tens of thousands leaving the country in a mass exodus. Police in Canada say there might be a connection between the killing of a young couple and the disappearance of two teens in the same region of British Columbia.

A pair of new studies say drug-resistant strains of the disease are indeed spreading through Southeast Asia, and that\u2019s raising fears of a \u201cpotential global health emergency.\u201d A strain that\u2019s resistant to multiple drugs has evolved and mutated into several new subgroups, the studies say. They have been found in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The strains have rendered a widely-used drug essentially ineffective, leading to treatment failures at \u201calarmingly high rates.\u201d\u00a0The new findings come as countries and health experts struggle to fight the parasitic disease. There have been some successes \u2013 Algeria and Argentina were declared malaria-free in May \u2013 but in other places, cases have been rising significantly.

            "article_content": "Welcome to CNN\u2019s fact check of the sixth Democratic presidential primary debate. Thursday\u2019s debate was hosted by PBS and Politico, and came a day after the House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump. It also came the same day the House voted to approve Trump\u2019s US-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Just a month and a half before the Iowa caucuses, the three-hour debate offered candidates a chance to delve more deeply into their policy disagreements than they had in their five previous clashes. Only seven candidates met the party\u2019s thresholds for qualification this time: former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessmen Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer. Buttigieg responded to an attack from Warren about his fundraising by reminding viewers that he is the least well-off candidate in the race. \u201cSenator, your net worth is 100 times mine,\u201d Buttigieg said after Warren highlighted Buttigieg\u2019s attendance at a fundraiser with $900 bottles \u201cin a wine cave full of crystals.\u201d Buttigieg was referencing a Forbes magazine article that rated the net worth of every candidate. The magazine estimated Warren\u2019s net worth at $12 million and his at just $100,000. Facts First: It\u2019s clear that Buttigieg earns far less than Warren, but documents publicly released so far don\u2019t offer comprehensive detail on candidates\u2019 net worth. Buttigieg, the youngest candidate, is the lowest earner on the debate stage, according to a review by CNN of tax returns of the presidential Democratic candidates. With his husband Chasten, Buttigieg had an adjusted gross income of $152,643 in 2018. By contrast, Warren reported an adjusted gross income of $846,394 in 2018 \u2013 $324,687 of which came from her books. In the past five years, Warren has earned the most from her writing, pulling in $2.8 million from her work, including the best-seller \u201cA Fighting Chance,\u201d as well as ongoing royalties from writing academic textbooks. \u2014 Donna Borak and Anna Bahney During an exchange with Sanders about campaign donations from billionaires, Biden said, \u201cThe largest contribution I\u2019ve accepted is $2,800, which is allowed under the law.\u201d Facts First: Biden was correct about the maximum donation to his campaign, and about the law \u2013 $2,800 is the legal maximum a person can donate to any candidate in this primary. But Biden omitted something significant: he is backed by a super PAC. Though we don\u2019t yet have information about donations to this super PAC \u2013 the group, called Unite the Country, was only formed in late October \u2013 all super PACs can accept donations of any amount. Like other super PACs, Unite the Country is separate from the campaign. But it was formed by a team that included longtime Biden advisers after the campaign publicly abandoned its previous opposition to receiving support from an outside group. While Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment on Thursday, in October his deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield issued a statement signaling the campaign\u2019s change of position. Bedingfield said that Biden would, as President, seek a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, a 2010 Supreme Court decision that led to the creation of Super PACs. But she said that, given the expected amount of campaign spending by Trump and given the \u201ccrisis in our politics,\u201d it is \u201cnot surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency.\u201d Trump\u2019s 2016 and 2020 campaigns have been aided by a variety of Super PACs. A leading pro-Trump Super PAC, America First Action, plans to spend tens of millions in support of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign; it has set a public goal of raising $300 million. \u2014  Daniel Dale Yang contrasted the strength of the US economy with Americans\u2019 well-being and said \u201cdepression, financial insecurity, student loan debt, even suicides and drug overdoses\u201d are at record highs. \u201cIt has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history.\u201d Facts First: Yang is stretching these sad facts. He\u2019s correct that life expectancy declined over a three-year period and while studies indicate these rates have risen in recent years, it\u2019s impossible to say they\u2019re at record highs. Depression is hard to quantify, though a Blue Cross Blue Shield study found, \u201cDiagnoses of major depression have risen dramatically by 33 percent\u201d between 2013 and 2016, and a study published in the journal Psychological Medicine found depression rose \u201csignificantly\u201d among Americans age 12 and older from 2005 to 2015. It\u2019s true that student loan debt, which has climbed to $1.5 trillion, has reached record levels. US suicide rates are the highest they\u2019ve been since World War II, according to research by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but suicide rates actually peaked in 1932, during the Great Depression. Drug overdose deaths increased between 1999 and 2017, but provisional data posted by the CDC earlier this month suggest that rate fell slightly last year \u2013 down to an estimated 69,000 deaths from about 70,000 the year before. Life expectancy decreased between 2014 and 2017, falling from 78.9 to 78.6, according to the CDC, which attributed the slight downtick to drug overdoses and suicides. A study by the by the National Safety Council found that the \u201codds of death\u201d for suicide and opioid overdose were higher than motor vehicle crashes. But Yang is incorrect in the way he compared this to all of US history. There were only 36 highway fatalities in the year 1900, for example. \u2014 Curt Devine Klobuchar said, \u201cIf you look at the poll[s], at the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory, it showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points.\u201d Facts First: She\u2019s basically right about the polls, but she\u2019s wrong about the 2016 election results. In 2016, Hillary Clinton barely defeated Donald Trump in Minnesota, winning by 1.6 percentage points. It was extremely close, but it wasn\u2019t her tightest margin of victory, as Klobuchar claimed. That state was New Hampshire, where Clinton won by about 0.4%. Looking ahead to 2020, Klobuchar accurately cited a recent poll from her home state of Minnesota. An October poll from the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the largest newspaper in the state, found that Klobuchar would have a 17-point lead over Trump, which is a larger lead over the President than her Democratic opponents. (The poll had a 3.5% margin of error.) \u2014 Marshall Cohen Yang, whose campaign has focused on the threat automation poses to US workers, claimed that President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 win was in part because \u201cwe blasted away 4 million manufacturing jobs\u201d \u2013 and further claimed that 40,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Iowa. Facts First: This is true, but only if you look back as far as the early 2000s. US manufacturing employment actually went up during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, and that\u2019s continued under Trump. The US lost 4.4 million manufacturing jobs between January 2000 and November 2019. The sharpest declines during this nearly two-decade stretch happened during the 2001 recession and between late 2007 and mid-2009 \u2013 that is, during the financial crisis. Similarly, Iowa lost jobs during that period, shedding a total of 20,900 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But looking at a more recent time frame, manufacturing jobs increased, improving from a net loss of 5.8 million jobs from 2000-2010. During Obama\u2019s second term, and following Trump\u2019s election, the sector added positions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics showed 385,000 additional manufacturing jobs were added between January 2013 and January 2017. Since Trump took office, the sector has added another 497,000 jobs. Iowa showed the same increasing trend for manufacturing positions, both in the lead-up to Trump\u2019s election and since he took office. That said, American factories have been suffering this year. The trade war has been weighing on business investment, demand for products and also hiring. The US manufacturing sector contracted for four months in a row through November, according to the Institute of Supply Management. \u2014 Anneken Tappe Asked about steps the US could take to address the rise of China, Biden said: \u201cWhat we have to make clear is that we, in fact, are not going to abide by what they have done. A million Uyghurs, as you pointed out, Muslims, are in concentration camps. That\u2019s where they are right now. They\u2019re being abused.\u201d Facts First: Concrete numbers on this issue are hard to come by. But the latest numbers from the US government and human rights organizations support Biden\u2019s claim. The United Nations estimates at least 1 million of the Muslim minority Uyghurs are being held in \u201cpolitical camps for indoctrination.\u201d In 2018, the US State Department estimated that anywhere from 800,000 to more than 2 million individuals are detained in these camps, which includes Uyghurs as well as members of other Muslim minority groups. In July 2019, a senior Chinese official said most of the detainees had been released but refused to provide updated figures on how many people remained in the camps. Documents leaked to The New York Times in November deeply undermine China\u2019s claims the detention camps are for voluntary re-education purposes, but representatives of the Chinese government continue to dismiss the accuracy of such documents. \u2014Tara Subramaniam Klobuchar accused Republicans of trying to improve their chances in future elections by suppressing the African-American vote, which has historically gone in favor of Democrats by large margins. \u201cThey have made it harder for African-Americans to vote,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAs one court said, \u2018discriminated with surgical precision.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Klobuchar got the quote right, and the rest of her claim is largely true. Republican-controlled legislatures across the country have passed laws aimed at preventing voter fraud that have made it harder for African-Americans to vote, and some of these laws have been declared unconstitutional by federal judges. The federal Commission on Civil Rights said in a 2018 report that there was a surge in state laws that make it harder for minorities to vote. The report highlighted laws signed by Republican governors in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri and several others. Those laws, which were aimed at preventing voter fraud, required voters to show government ID before casting a ballot, scaled back the availability of early voting, and eliminated voter registration options. Klobuchar got the quote right. A federal appeals court struck down North Carolina\u2019s voter ID law in 2016, and in their ruling, they said the law would \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d Alluding to the law\u2019s racial motivations, the court said it \u201cimpose[s] cures for problems that did not exist.\u201d A separate federal court ruled that a similar law in Texas discriminated against black and Latino voters. Klobuchar said she\u2019d tackle the problem by trying to \u201cstop the purging\u201d of voters from the rolls, which became a major issue this month after purges in Wisconsin and Georgia. But that might be easier said than done: Elections are run by the states, not the federal government. So if Klobuchar becomes president, she\u2019d have limited influence over state officials who administrate elections and have overseen the recent purges. \u2014 Marshall Cohen In response to a question about being the only non-white candidate on stage, Yang pointed to statistics on disenfranchisement among communities of color, noting that \u201cif you\u2019re a black woman, you\u2019re 320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders later echoed the claim, asserting that \u201cblack women die three times at higher rates than white women.\u201d Facts First: The candidates are correct \u2013 black women die from childbirth complications more than three times as often as do white women, according to government medical data. According to a report released in May using Centers for Disease Control data from 2011 to 2015, black women experienced 42.8 pregnancy related deaths for every 100,000 live births \u2013  3.3 times as high as the 13.0 such deaths for every 100,000 live births among white women. The study showed that about 700 women die due to pregnancy-related complications in the United States each year. \u2014 Caroline Kelly Calling for an international effort to fight the climate crisis, Sanders criticized global spending on weapons. \u201cAnd maybe, just maybe, instead of spending $1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president \u2013 i.e. Bernie Sanders \u2013 can lead the world. Instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change,\u201d Sanders said. Facts First: Sanders was speaking imprecisely. The $1.8 trillion figure represents all global military spending in 2018, not spending on weapons in particular. Upon issuing the $1.8 trillion figure in April, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an international authority on military spending, said it \u201cdiscourages the use of terms such as \u2018arms spending\u2019 when referring to military expenditure, as spending on armaments is usually only a minority of the total.\u201d \u201cMilitary expenditure refers to all government spending on current military forces and activities, including salaries and benefits, operational expenses, arms and equipment purchases, military construction, research and development, and central administration, command and support,\u201d the Institute said. \u2014 Daniel Dale",

            "article_content": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN\u2019s Impeachment Watch newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The outcome of the Democratic impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump has seemed like a foregone conclusion almost since it started. Impeachment in the House would be followed by acquittal in the Senate, and the election next November. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi jammed a wrench into the machine shortly after impeaching Trump on Wednesday night, creatively using her power to slow things down as the articles move from the House over to the Senate. Rather than appoint managers right away to prosecute the case before the Senate as the Constitution ultimately requires, she\u2019s going to take her time and see what she can squeeze out of Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. He wanted to start a trial the first week of January. But the House didn\u2019t appoint impeachment managers before leaving for its holiday break. Read this piece on how Pelosi is stepping into a new power role, by CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston. Will Trump get acquittal or impeachment purgatory? Pelosi\u2019s threat to leave the impeached President in limbo until she knows more about the shape of a Senate trial bends the plot line in a way befitting the reality TV ethos by which Trump is leading the country. See what she did there? He was expecting acquittal before the 2020 caucuses and primaries start. Instead, she\u2019s making him sweat \u2013 and all of us wonder what comes next. Remember, Democrats sped the impeachment process along, arguing they couldn\u2019t wait for the courts to compel testimony from the White House or people like John Bolton, who all but begged the courts to make him testify. And now Pelosi\u2019s taking her time, thank you very much. On one hand, McConnell has made clear he\u2019ll defeat this when he gets it. He\u2019s in Trump\u2019s corner. For Pelosi to now argue the process should be slowed is in direct opposition to her previous tactic, which was to move it along. The ultimate sideshow And Pelosi seized power from McConnell and from Trump, who were in cahoots to speed along the Senate trial. (Remember, it was McConnell sat on Merrick Garland\u2019s Supreme Court nomination for a year. Now he\u2019s all about speed.) Republicans were wailing about the fast process until Wednesday night. Instead, there will first be a scorched-earth parliamentary chess clash, if such a thing exists, between Pelosi and McConnell. Regardless, Trump\u2019s still the President and will continue to be. So this is, while annoying to him, a sideshow unless or until Republican senators start sounding like they\u2019ll support the impeachment. There\u2019s no evidence they will. In this representative democracy, the House is actually supposed to be closest to the people. Pelosi is showing herself to be very good at reminding people of that. It\u2019s a little ridiculous to think of the week separate from impeachment. But if you do, it is these kinds of weeks that will fuel Trump\u2019s reelection pitch. I wrote about this Thursday. Even as she was overseeing his impeachment, it\u2019s worth pointing out that Pelosi gave Trump some real policy wins this week. They passed the USMCA (for which Trump should thank Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, the Democratic congresswoman he insulted Wednesday night), they funded the government, they authorized Trump\u2019s new space force and they gave federal workers paid family leave. In any other world, that would have been a nice way to close out the year. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen made this extremely important point about Trump\u2019s insult of Debbie Dingell and his insinuation that her dead husband might be in hell: Everyone is rightly focusing on how Trump said Wednesday night that Dingell could be in hell. But Trump also said something that was very revealing about how he approaches his office, and his presidential powers. And it\u2019s one reason why he got into the Ukraine mess. Trump essentially patted himself on the back for NOT asking Debbie Dingell for anything in exchange for him using his presidential powers to lower the flags. (\u201cI don\u2019t want anything for it.\u201d) To Trump, it was charitable of him NOT to demand some sort of quid pro quo from Dingell. (\u201cI don\u2019t need anything for anything.\u201d) This isn\u2019t new, but it\u2019s another example of how he operates. Here\u2019s a reminder of what that looked like in Ukraine, from the impeachment testimony. Trump likes to brag about how united the GOP is. And it\u2019s certainly true that his impeachment has focused the elected class in his party on his preservation like never before. He met in the Oval Office on Thursday with the newest Republican, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who was part of the wave that helped Democrats take the House in November 2018 but opposed impeachment and joined the GOP, perhaps in part to avoid a primary challenge. Anyone for Trump is welcome in the GOP. A party built around an ego But it\u2019s also true that Trump has robbed the GOP of its ideological center. It\u2019s a party built around him at this point, not around any idea. Party vs. principle The most principled person in Washington at the moment, arguably, is Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, the libertarian-leaning congressman who left the GOP to support Trump\u2019s impeachment. He gave a lonely looking speech from the Democratic side of the aisle Wednesday, supporting Trump\u2019s impeachment even though he disagrees with Democrats on most things. Arguing against enablers Here are some interesting things written on Twitter among anti-Trump conservatives and also establishment Republicans who have bought into him: \u201cOne day in the not too distant future, Republicans will wake up and say, \u2018We did this for this man?\u2019 \u201d wrote former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff and Republican National Committee chairman who, unlike many former White House staffers, has not run afoul of Trump, spoke up for his boss. \u201cFrom here on out, most Presidents will now get impeached when the opposite party holds the House. This is a new political game that will play out for decades to come,\u201d Priebus wrote. That drew a scathing response from Bill Kristol, the neocon intellectual who is angry at the GOP over Trump. \u201cFuture presidents will only get impeached if they behave like Trump, and Trump\u2019s behavior was possible thanks to mainstream enablers like @Reince, and in particular by their silence once they were no longer working for him but were still benefiting from an association with him,\u201d Kristol wrote. David Chalian talked about how impeachment would affect Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate with CNN senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny and CNN political correspondent Abby Phillip. The Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii voted present on impeachment despite the overwhelming opinion of her party. She\u2019s still running for President despite not being on the debate stage Thursday night. This quote shared on Twitter is fascinating: \u201cMy \u2018present\u2019 vote was an active protest against the zero-sum game the two opposing political sides have trapped America in. My vote and campaign is about freeing our country from this damaging mindset so we can work side-by-side to usher in a bright future for all.\u201d I read this paragraph in The Washington Post and it perfectly summarizes Wednesday: Donald J. Trump inherited a fortune, built an empire and has spent his life grabbing for more, transforming scandal and bankruptcy into opportunity, playing on his strengths and America\u2019s weaknesses in a half-century spree that won him the presidency, but on Wednesday he could do nothing but stew and thrash and watch as the nation that gave him everything tried to take something back. The President has invited foreign powers to interfere in the US presidential election. Democrats have impeached him for it. Next up is a trial in the Senate to decide whether to remove him from office. It is a crossroads for the American system of government as the President tries to change what\u2019s acceptable for US politicians.

            "article_content": "Even as the House was impeaching President Donald Trump, he was in the midst of a rowdy campaign rally in Michigan. The President, clearly both agitated by the proceedings in Washington and energized by the cheering crowd in front of him, spoke for more than two hours Wednesday night \u2013 railing against, well, everyone. I went through the whole transcript \u2013 so you don\u2019t have to \u2013 and picked out the most, er, interesting Trump lines. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cAnd did you notice that everybody is saying merry Christmas again? Did you notice?\u201d I did not! And away we go! 2. \u201cRemember when I first started this beautiful trip, this beautiful journey, I just said to the first lady, \u2018You\u2019re so lucky I took you on this fantastic journey.\u2019 \u201c I wonder if Melania Trump would describe herself as \u201cso lucky.\u201d 3. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really feel like we\u2019re being impeached.\u201d What, specifically, does being impeached feel like? Maybe a really bad charley horse? Or like closing your fingers in a car door? Touching a hot stove? I\u2019m just spitballing here. 4. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this but probably 10 years ago I was honored. I was the man of the year by I think somebody, whoever. I was the man of the year in Michigan, can you believe it? Long time.\u201d There is no proof this actually happened. None. 5. \u201cAnyway, I was the man of the year and probably like close to 10 years ago and I came to Michigan \u2013 he said you\u2019re still the man of the year.\u201d Again, almost certainly not. 6. \u201cYou know I had a lot of union labor. Vote for me, tremendous amount of labor.\u201d Of the 18% of the 2016 electorate who said they were members of union households, Trump won 42% of the vote to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 51%. Four years earlier, Mitt Romney had taken 40% among union households but lost to President Barack Obama by 18 points with that voting bloc. 7. \u201cThey won\u2019t say it, because when we have protests that\u2019s all in favor, they don\u2019t talk about it, but there\u2019s a slob. There\u2019s a real slob.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a slob. There\u2019s a real sob.\u201d \u2013 The President of the United States on a protester. 8. \u201cOK, so there\u2019s one disgusting person who made \u2013 wait \u2013 wait, who made a, I wouldn\u2019t say this but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger. Right?\u201d Wait, so is Trump saying the protester meant to give him the middle finger but stuck up her index finger instead? If so, who does that? 9. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the security company is, but the police came up but they want to be so politically correct. So they don\u2019t grab her wrists lightly and get her out. They say, oh would you please come \u2013 would you please come with me?\u201d Example #2,514 of Donald Trump advocating rough treatment of people who have been or are being arrested or removed from a speech. 10. \u201cBut of course the guy\u2019s afraid that, you know, he\u2019ll grab her wrists lightly and he\u2019ll be sued for the rest of his life that you\u2019ve destroyed her life.\u201d Trump filters everything \u2013 EVERYTHING \u2013 through the lens of his alleged rejection of PC culture. And yes, litigious lawyers fit nicely into that frame. 11. \u201cThis is one person who made a horrible gesture only because the security man let her have so much time and usually I have to say the police do an incredible job.\u201d Oh, I see: The protester was allowed to give Trump the \u201cwrong finger\u201d because the police did a bad job. I think? THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 12. \u201cBattle Creek. Battle Creek. I\u2019ve been eating Battle Creek cereals for a long time, too much. Too much. They\u2019re still making great cereal.\u201d Fun fact: Battle Creek, Michigan, is known as \u201cthe Cereal City\u201d!! 13. \u201cI said, don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019re going to take care of you guys and I used a bad word. You know what word I used?\u201d No, please tell me. I\u2019ll wait. 14. \u201cSee, in the old days \u2013 in the old days I would say mankind, now I say mankind, womankind. This way I don\u2019t get in trouble with our friends.\u201d Woke Donald Trump is my favorite Donald Trump. 15. \u201cAnd I was at one of the areas where they\u2019re displaying it and I went up to the pilots and honestly they\u2019re better looking than Tom Cruise. Good movie.\u201d I too enjoy \u201cTop Gun.\u201d On a related note: \u201cThat\u2019s right! Ice \u2026 Man. I am dangerous.\u201d 16. \u201cThe face is equal, maybe slightly better. The body\u2019s bigger and stronger.\u201d OK, so our current F-35 pilots have faces equal to Tom Cruise in \u201cTop Gun\u201d but better bodies? Helpful! 17. \u201cIt\u2019s actually called super stealth. So I said, you mean they can\u2019t see \u2013 so you shoot at them but they can\u2019t \u2013 he said they have no idea where we are, sir. I said that sounds good to me, nobody does it. Nobody can do it. We have the whole thing and we ordered a lot of those plans.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s called super stealth.\u201d 18. \u201cSo I\u2019ll be able to tell my kids someday and everybody else, see that Space Force. That was my baby, and you think that was easy?\u201d Mars Awaits! 19. \u201cBut he said, sir, I want to thank you. My wife thinks I\u2019m a loser. All my life, we never did well with the 401(k)s, with stocks, everything I invested. I\u2019m up 72%, sir. She thinks I\u2019m a financial genius. She\u2019s so in love with me. She\u2019s so in love.\u201d As CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale has noted, any Trump story that includes the word \u201csir\u201d has a very high probability of not being true. 20. \u201cThe cameras \u2013 do you ever notice I go to these stadiums, 25-30,000 people. They never show the crowd.\u201d One of Trump\u2019s most oft-repeated untruths. The cameras regularly show the crowds. 21. \u201cWe went to different \u2013 Pennsylvania, Florida, and \u2013 I mean thousands and thousands of people can\u2019t get into these, you know, NBA arenas. Right? Big arenas, and we set records at every one because we use the floor.\u201d Using the floor is key to breaking records, Everyone knows this. 22. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator. That\u2019s a long time ago. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had an empty seat.\u201d [narrator voice] He has. 23. \u201cBut every time I see \u2013 I see a man get up. I see a beautiful woman with a baby and they\u2019re getting up. The baby\u2019s going crazy and they\u2019re getting up. They\u2019re going to take care \u2013 I know they\u2019re going to be right back and I say fill those two seats. I don\u2019t want them to see it because they\u2019ll say, couldn\u2019t fill up the arena.\u201d What Trump reveals here, unintentionally, is his massive insecurity about being adored. 24. \u201cWe had 32,000 people that night. It was 1 o\u2019clock in the morning. That means it was Election Day when I started speaking.\u201d Trump often references this speech that he gave in the early hour of Election Day 2016 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The problem? There were more like 3,000 people (not 32,000) in attendance. 25. \u201cHow many people were there? 32,000. Thirty-two \u2013 32,000 people outside, inside.\u201d [narrator voice] It was 3,000. 26. \u201cI like him. I like him. \u2026 Because he\u2019s a pro, he\u2019s an instinct guy. Right?\u201d Trump on Bill Clinton. Yes, really. 27. \u201cAnd he said, you horrible human being, you better start listening to me because you\u2019re going to get your ass whupped.\u201d This is Trump re-creating a fake conversation between Bill and Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 election. And, yes, in Trump\u2019s world Bill Clinton refers to his wife as a \u201chorrible human being\u201d when talking with her. 28. \u201cAnd we won Michigan, and the word is that we\u2019re much higher right now in the polls than we were ever in 2016 in Michigan.\u201d Trump trails both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders by 7 points in Michigan. So, no. 29. \u201cThat\u2019s why they call him Mayor Pete. OK. Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete. I\u2019ve had you up to here, Mayor Pete.\u201d In which the President of the United States takes a shot at the height of one of his Democratic rivals. This is my surprised face. 30. \u201cI saw them pronouncing Buttigieg and they said here\u2019s what you do, \u2018Boot Edge Edge.\u2019 Say edge, like an edge of a building. \u2018Edge.\u2019 \u2018Edge.\u2019 \u201c [nods head uncertainly] 31. \u201cI said when I was honored that night, I said, how do you let this happen? How do you let all these companies leave?\u201d Just to reiterate: There is zero evidence Trump was ever honored as Michigan\u2019s man of the year. Ever. 32. \u201cBut we had 18 people and I was center stage and I said, wait a minute, this is no good. I want odd numbers because if you\u2019re center stage, if you have a 10 that means two people are in the middle. So I said make it 11 or make it nine. OK, or I\u2019m not showing up, and generally they did it.\u201d So, during the 2016 campaign, Trump demanded of the debate sponsor that they have an odd number of candidates onstage so he could be alone in the center? Quick note here: That never happened. 33. \u201cWasn\u2019t that fun? Through their \u2013 I liked it. Through their depraved actions today, crazy Nancy Pelosi\u2019s House Democrats have branded themselves with an eternal mark of shame and it really is.\u201d These are three unedited sentences that the President said back to back to back. For real. (In case you were wondering: He was referring to the 2016 primary when he said he \u201cliked it.\u201d And, no, that doesn\u2019t make these sentences any less random.) 34. \u201cOther countries come to see me, all of their leaders they say, sir, first thing, sir, congratulations on your economy. We\u2019re trying to do the same thing. Congratulations sir.\u201d If this actually happens, which I very much doubt, it\u2019s because foreign leaders are smart and have realized that flattery will get them everywhere with Trump. 35. \u201cI mean, I go to these places, you know, Secret Service, they take me \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen a lobby in three years. It\u2019s true. I go through basements. I pass compactor plants. I know about compactors from this job. I don\u2019t see lobbies. I say fellas, you think you could ever maybe take me through a lobby? No, sir. But I tell you what, I go upstairs, downstairs, all around. They\u2019re taking me up three flights, go down one. I said are we almost there? Yes, sir. Another four flights.\u201d \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af 36. \u201cAnd I say you think Hillary could do this? I don\u2019t think so. They\u2019d bring her back home. She wants to go to sleep.\u201d More than three years after the 2016 election, Trump continues to stoke the idea that Hillary Clinton is infirm or too old to do the job of president. She is 72 years old. Trump is 73. 37. \u201cAnd then we learned about Lisa Page and her wonderful lover, Peter Strzok. I love you, Lisa. I love you more than anybody in the world. I love you more than anybody in the world. Of course, there\u2019s problems with the wife but we won\u2019t talk about that.\u201d The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general report found that neither Page nor Strzok, both of whom were FBI employees during the 2016 election, did anything to negatively impact the counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Also, why is Trump so focused in the fact that they were engaged in an extramarital affair? 38. \u201cI understand that but it\u2019s my life, very unfair to my family. I have to say this. Very, very unfair to my family. What they\u2019ve put my family through is a disgrace.\u201d Trump loves few roles more than he loves that of victim. 39. \u201cHe walks up to the mics, I mean, we\u2019re not \u2013 and no offense, I don\u2019t want to be \u2013 because with me too I never think about looks anymore. OK. I don\u2019t talk about looks of a male or female but in his case let\u2019s just say, last time I\u2019ll ever refer to this. He\u2019s not exactly the best-looking guy we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d No big deal \u2013 just the President of the United States saying the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is ugly. Totally normal stuff here! 40. \u201cYou\u2019re declaring open war on American democracy.\u201d Trump, here speaking about congressional Democrats, has never been one for understatement. 41. \u201cThat\u2019s why, you know, with Richard Nixon I just see it as a very dark era, very dark, very oh, you don\u2019t even like to think \u2013 I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m having a good time. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af 42.  \u201cShe calls me up and said it\u2019s the nicest thing that\u2019s ever happened. \u2018Thank you so much. John would be so thrilled. He\u2019s looking down, he\u2019d be so thrilled. Thank you so much, sir.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s OK. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 Maybe he\u2019s looking up, I don\u2019t know.\u201d In which Trump suggests the late Democratic Rep. John Dingell of Michigan may be in hell, because his wife, Rep. Debbie Dingell, voted for impeachment. Truly appalling stuff. 43. \u201cI said, she\u2019s a no. No, but I \u2013 I look at her and she\u2019s so sincere, and what happens? I vote to impeach Trump. And \u2013 and you know what? I didn\u2019t say who the hell knew this was even going to come up.\u201d A fascinating window into how Trump views all of life as one big transaction. Because he ordered flags lowered to half masts to honor John Dingell, he assumed that Debbie Dingell would never vote for his impeachment, Because she owed him \u2013 or something. 44. \u201c[Democrats will] receive a big backlash at the box office.\u201d Freudian slip. 45. \u201cI have to be always very truthful because if I\u2019m a little bit off they call me a liar.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump has made 15,413 false or misleading claims over 1,055 days\u201d \u2013 The Washington Post 46. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can say where you don\u2019t get a Pinocchio.\u201d [raises hand timidly] What about, uh, you know, the truth? 47. \u201cThey\u2019re making more money than they\u2019ve ever made. That crazy New York Times, one of the worst newspapers in the world.\u201d \u201cThe failing New York Times.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump 48. \u201cNo, they\u2019re among the most dishonest people \u2013 but I never forget before I took that great escalator ride down with our first lady. Our first lady\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d How How HOW did his mind go from an attack on the press to his announcement speech? HOW. 49.  \u201cI said to all my people, I have great people in the back, I say you folks are so lucky I took you on this.\u201d Like all great leaders, Trump\u2019s message to the people who work for him is: You\u2019re lucky I did this for you. A true statesman. 50. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re the elite. They\u2019re not the elite. You\u2019re the elite. You\u2019re the elite. You do better than they do. They talk about \u2013 don\u2019t you hate it \u2013 well (ph) the elite. Oh, really? I went to better schools. Many of you went to better schools. We won\u2019t talk about homes even though your homes are nice here.\u201d \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af 51. \u201cI\u2019m telling you I have a group of African American guys and gals by the way that follow me around and they think I pay them and I don\u2019t. I love them. They love me.\u201d \u201cOh, look at my African American over here. Look at him. Are you the greatest?\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump 52. \u201cEvery stadium is packed. I give my people one instruction: Get the largest stadium you can get. Now that\u2019s why I was a little surprised but in Battle Creek you don\u2019t have that many. Right? Not too many stadiums but I wanted to be here.\u201d This is \u2013 at least \u2013 the third time Trump brought up his crowd sizes in this speech alone. Draw your own conclusions. 53. \u201cYou know a salesman, you know if you\u2019re a great salesman, you never talk if you\u2019re a good salesman. You don\u2019t walk in and say well I\u2019m a great salesman.\u201d \u201cDeals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals.\u201d  \u2013 Donald Trump 54. \u201cI say, why do I always look so orange? You know why? Because of the new light, they\u2019re terrible. You look terrible.\u201d Real quote. By the President of the United States. 55. \u201cI did a lot of this sinks, showers, all of this stuff. I did a lot of it. No water comes out. You have areas where there\u2019s so much water you don\u2019t know what to do with it. You turn on the shower, you\u2019re not allowed to have any water anymore.\u201d \u201cI did a lot of this sinks, showers.\u201d \u2013 The President of the United States 56. \u201cDishwashers, the dishwasher, right? You press it. Remember the dishwasher, you press it, there\u2019d be like an explosion. Five minutes later you open it up the steam pours out, the dishes \u2013 now you press it 12 times, women tell me again.\u201d \u201cWomen tell me.\u201d 57. \u201cWell, we like the old light bulb better. I said, I like it better, and so what I did is you can [buy] either one. If you want to buy the newer kind you can and if you want to look very handsome or beautiful by buying the older kind like I do.\u201d Laser-focused on the big and important stuff. 58. \u201cIt probably gives a better light but whatever it is and you\u2019ll be able to spend a lot less money for a light bulb. I mean, it sounds like little but it\u2019s big stuff. OK. It\u2019s big stuff.\u201d Like I said, the \u201cbig stuff.\u201d 59. \u201cSinks. Right? Showers and what goes with a sink and a shower? Ten times. Right? Ten times. Bong, bong, not me of course, not me, but you, you.\u201d What. The. Actual. Hell. Is. Going. On. 60. \u201cYou want to wash your hands, you turn on the sink, no water comes out. So you leave the water go 10 times as long. It\u2019s the same thing. You have a shower. It\u2019s no good for me.\u201d Yes, he is still talking about water pressure. 61. \u201cI used to \u2013 they always used to say I wore a hairpiece. It\u2019s OK. I know people wear headpieces but they always used to say, they don\u2019t say that anymore because I have been through the worst storms.\u201d I swear to you I am not making up these quotes. 62. \u201cHe used to kiss my ass, Chuck Schumer. He\u2019d do anything. He would have done anything for me, anything I\u2019d ask him. Get Schumer on the phone. You do this. You do that.\u201d Transaction, transaction, transaction. 63. \u201cI will say I could have a much easier life. Some people say, why is he doing it?\u201d Yes, some people do ask, \u201cWhy is he doing it?\u201d 64. \u201cWe\u2019re respected again. We\u2019re respected again. We are so respected. You don\u2019t even know how respected.\u201d YOU DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW. 65. \u201cI can be loved in Germany. I could be loved in Germany. Oh, they\u2019d love me.\u201d Offered without comment. This feels like a good place to end.",

            "article_content": "Former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said she thinks it is \u201cvital\u201d that President Donald Trump be impeached, but stopped short of calling for his removal from office and did not rule out voting for him again in 2020. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO told CNN on \u201cBoss Files with Poppy Harlow\u201d that she sees the President\u2019s conduct as impeachable and \u201cdestructive to the republic.\u201d \u201cI think it is vital that he be impeached,\u201d Fiorina said. But whether Trump should be removed from office, Fiorina said, \u201cthis close to an election, I don\u2019t know.\u201d House Democrats last week unveiled the two articles of impeachment they prepared against Trump after a two-and-a-half month investigation into his pressure on Ukraine to investigate his 2020 political rival Joe Biden as well as conspiracy theories about foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election. The full House will vote on the articles this week. In 2016, there was speculation Fiorina was under consideration for a Cabinet position in the Trump administration. She met with Trump in Trump Tower shortly after he was elected, and a senior transition official told CNN at the time that the two were meeting to discuss the Director of National Intelligence position. Fiorina told Harlow for \u201cBoss Files\u201d that no specific position was discussed during that meeting. After dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination in 2016, Fiorina said she did vote for Trump in 2016, citing her disapproval of then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but since then she has been \u201cbitterly disappointed.\u201d But when asked whether she would vote for Trump in next year\u2019s presidential election, Fiorina did not rule out voting for him again. \u201cIt depends who the Democrats put up,\u201d she said. Fiorina condemned Trump\u2019s attacks on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated veteran who is the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert and testified before House impeachment investigators. \u201cSome of this conduct, like publicly berating a decorated war veteran who shows up in response to a lawfully issued subpoena of Congress, I think that conduct is not just unbecoming, I think it\u2019s destructive to our republic,\u201d Fiorina said. Fiorina faced her own share of attacks from Trump during the 2016 Republican primary. In a September 2015 Rolling Stone interview, Trump mocked Fiorina\u2019s looks and said, \u201cLook at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d Trump later said he was talking about her persona, not her appearance. Fiorina responded the following week at a CNN debate, and said, \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u201d Fiorina told Harlow on \u201cBoss Files\u201d that Trump has \u201cundoubtedly done some of the right things,\u201d and praised him for his role in strengthening the economy. But, she said, \u201cI do think that the systematic tearing down of people, institutions, political opponents, will have long-lasting damage if it goes on for much longer.\u201d Fiorina told CNN she does not know whether she would run for president again. At the moment, she said she doesn\u2019t think that running as a Republican is something she has interest in. She said the Republican Party \u201cright now seems to be all about pledging fealty to Donald Trump no matter what. And I\u2019m just not in that place.\u201d When asked about why there are so few Republican women in Congress, Fiorina said she believes the GOP has sent a message to women in the US that they don\u2019t value or respect them. \u201cI think there is a reason why women, people of color, young people, don\u2019t feel affinity for the Republican Party. It\u2019s because the brand, the way business has been conducted, sends a message: we don\u2019t value you, and we don\u2019t respect you,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cNow, I say that as a proud pro-life woman,\u201d Fiorina continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pro-life or pro-choice. It\u2019s about how women and people of color and young people are addressed, are sought out or not. By the same token, the reason Democrats lost in 2016 is there was a swath of people who felt disrespected and devalued.\u201d \u201cPolitics is personal, so it starts with a real fundamental \u2018Do I feel like you personally respect me?\u2019 and until Republicans decide that that\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s not going to get better,\u201d Fiorina said. Fiorina also weighed in on the 2020 election and contrasted former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg against Trump, praising Bloomberg as someone who \u201cactually knows something about running an organization,\u201d unlike Trump, she said. She said Bloomberg\u2019s vulnerability is that people think the billionaire is trying to \u201cbuy the office, and people resent that, I think.\u201d Bloomberg has outspent all of his Democratic rivals on TV ads, spending more than $100 million. Fiorina was the first woman to head a Fortune 50 company and a company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average when she became CEO and president of Hewlett-Packard in 1999. She was later forced out by the company\u2019s board after engineering a controversial merger that did not produce the shareholder returns or profits Fiorina had promised and resigned in 2005. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect that Carly Fiorina was the first woman to lead a Fortune 50 company when she became CEO and president of Hewlett-Packard.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN\u2019s Impeachment Watch newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. We saw two weeks of fact witnesses, mostly civil servants \u2013 many of whom have worked for Presidents of both parties, and who are currently or were recently serving proudly under President Donald Trump \u2013 confirm the basic storyline laid out in August by the whistleblower. It is this: Trump tried to thwart the will of Congress and use taxpayer dollars as leverage to get a foreign leader to hurt a political rival. The hours of testimony were best summed up by British-born Russia expert Fiona Hill, who said Thursday that the President replaced national security foreign policy with a \u201cdomestic political errand\u201d \u2013 a move that has left the US exposed to further Russian interference in its democratic process. There have been 12 public witnesses. Here\u2019s the key element each one offered: Bill Taylor, the top official at the US Embassy in Ukraine, brought the accusations to life as he described how he came to realize over the summer that Ukrainians were being pressured to announce investigations that involved baseless allegations of Ukrainian influence in 2016 and, separately, Burisma, the company that employed Hunter Biden. He put his concerns in writing. Read his opening statement here. George Kent, the top official for Eurasia policy at the State Department, talked about how Trump\u2019s decision to deputize his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani as his policy proxy amounted to an end run around the State Department and led to the smear campaign against now-former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Read his opening statement here. Marie Yovanovitch talked about how Giuliani spread conspiracy theories at a time when the new Ukrainian government headed by Volodymyr Zelensky needed support from the US \u2013 and how intimidated she felt. Read her opening statement here. Alexander Vindman talked about hearing Trump pressure Zelensky and immediately raising concerns. He talked about how those concerns went nowhere even though they built on previous concerns he had raised after a confrontational meeting with Gordon Sondland at the White House. Read his opening remarks here. Jennifer Williams, who was also on the July 25 call, confirmed she thought it was unusual and more political than a call between the President and another world leader would normally be. Read her opening remarks here. Kurt Volker, the former special envoy for Ukraine, said he didn\u2019t realize that Trump\u2019s request that Burisma be investigated was the same as investigating the Bidens until he read the transcript of the July 25 call when it was released in September. If he had known, he would have raised his own objections, he said. Read his opening remarks here. Tim Morrison, who succeeded Hill as the White House\u2019s Russia expert, didn\u2019t see a problem with the call, but he knew it would be a problem if it became public. He was right. He knew investigating Burisma was code for investigating the Bidens because he Googled it. Read his opening remarks here. Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU and a Trump donor, said yes, there was quid pro quo and that everyone at the top of the Trump administration was \u201cin the know.\u201d He also said if he\u2019d known that investigating the Bidens was the same as investigating Burisma, he would have raised his own concerns. Read his opening remarks here. Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official, talked about how freezing the Ukraine aid confused and alarmed Defense officials in mid-July and also how Ukrainians may have known the aid was frozen by the time Trump talked to Zelensky on the phone. Read her earlier testimony here. David Hale, a top State Department official, said Yovanovitch was a good ambassador and that what happened to her was wrong. Read his earlier testimony here. Fiona Hill, the former Russia expert at the White House, distilled the whole thing into what it was \u2013 a domestic political errand rather than a genuine foreign policy. And she deconstructed Trump\u2019s fiction that Ukraine was out to get him in 2016. Read her opening remarks here. David Holmes, the Ukraine embassy official, tied Trump directly to the desire for investigations. Read his opening remarks here. With those facts, Democrats hope Americans will understand that Trump was holding the promise of tax dollars \u2013 and more broadly, US support \u2013 over Zelensky\u2019s head to make him investigate the Bidens. They\u2019ll say that\u2019s bribery or some other high crime and misdemeanor. Democrats were only able to present half the story. The White House made the decision not to cooperate, so we haven\u2019t seen key documents and we haven\u2019t heard key testimony. We likely won\u2019t hear Trump\u2019s side until or unless Trump is impeached and this moves to a full trial in the Senate. Here are some people we should probably hear from but who aren\u2019t talking: One: CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen reports that US intelligence officials told senators and their aides in a classified briefing this fall that Russia has engaged in a years-long campaign to shift the blame away from Moscow and onto Ukraine for interfering in the 2016 American presidential campaign, according to two US officials familiar with the briefing. House GOP members have continued to insist they believe that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, despite hours of testimony to the contrary. More on that here from Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb. Two: One of Trump\u2019s frequent claims about the Russia investigation is that his campaign was spied on by the Obama administration. Finally, a long-awaited report into the origins of that investigation is nigh, and it\u2019s not expected to back up Trump\u2019s position. From CNN\u2019s Evan Perez: The Department of Justice Inspector General\u2019s report on the start of FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election will say the probe was properly launched but lower-level employees made a series of mistakes. The investigation on the effort to obtain warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act on Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, is expected to conclude that the FBI\u2019s so-called \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d investigation \u2013 which became the Russia investigation \u2013 was properly predicated, and that there were a series of mistakes and improper handling of the Page FISA application by lower-level employees. The New York Times was first to report on the expected conclusion of the report. The President of the United States called in to Fox News on Friday morning and spent almost an hour responding to the impeachment hearings and complaining about the process. Here\u2019s CNN\u2019s rundown of the 18 false claims he made in the interview. One quote in particular struck me, since he seemed to imply that anyone in government before he took office is a \u201cnever Trumper.\u201d This is a patently ridiculous allegation, but it was a window into his paranoia about the loyalty of the people serving in the government he leads. Calling the witnesses 'never Trumpers' won't get Trump off the hook It\u2019s not about Republicans or Democrats for the President. It\u2019s about Trumpers and never Trumpers. \u201cAgain I don\u2019t even know these people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know I come to Washington, so you\u2019ve had Bush and you have never-Trumpers and you have Bush, you have Clinton, you have Obama. So you have 24 years of people in positions, right? Then I come in with no experience, which is the good thing but I know life and I come in and I end up with thousands of people that are never-Trumpers.\u201d I talked about this on the Impeachment Watch podcast with Lisa Monaco, a CNN analyst who was homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to President Obama and also Marshall Cohen, who maintains CNN\u2019s Impeachment Tracker. \u201cTwo weeks of impeachment hearings have revealed as much about the Republican Party as they did about the President\u2019s actions toward Ukraine,\u201d writes the presidential historian Julian Zelizer. Read this. \u201cAs I have argued before, President Trump did not change the Republican Party. He is a product of a new GOP. But what the President exposes is how much the GOP has changed: how the pursuit of partisan power now overwhelms almost any concern for norms, governance and, to some extent, national security.\u201d \u201c\u2026 Rather than having a debate about whether the President\u2019s actions were impeachable, Republicans instead treated the nation to a week of wild-eyed accusations that simply pushed aside the alarming reality that credible witnesses \u2014 public servants all \u2014 laid before them.\u201d Everyone else is thinking about impeaching the President of the United States and John Bolton is playing games on Twitter. Gain some perspective, sir. Nothing with John Bolton is ever simple. But this is a new level of manufactured drama. Bolton knows how Washington works better than almost anyone. He\u2019s been in and out of government since the Reagan era. He emerged on Twitter after a two-month hiatus, saying that he had gotten his social media back after being blocked for months by the White House. Great. Everyone wants to know what he has to say about Trump and Ukraine. After all, he claims to have offered to resign on the very day everything blew up \u2013 when the inspector general for the intelligence community told Congress about the whistleblower and when Bill Taylor was warning against holding up Ukrainian aid in exchange for investigations. Trump's Ukraine scandal: Who's who? Why oh why must Bolton bring the drama? Presumably, he wants a court to compel him to testify so he\u2019s not violating his own dedication to executive privilege. (Also, he\u2019s working on a book.) Late Friday, CNN reporters caught Bolton as he arrived at Union Station from New York. When asked whether the White House was blocking him from testifying in the impeachment inquiry, Bolton said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019ll have to ask the White House.\u201d He was also asked whether he was in conversations with the House. \u201cI have no comment on any of that,\u201d he replied. Just spill the freakin\u2019 beans already. It\u2019s only the future of the country we\u2019re talking about here. \u201cI am disappointed, and quite frankly I\u2019m angered, by the fact \u2013 he knows me; he knows my son; he knows there\u2019s nothing to this,\u201d Biden said of his former Senate colleague Sen. Lindsay Graham, who is Trump\u2019s top defender. \u201cTrump is now essentially holding power over him that even the Ukrainians wouldn\u2019t yield to.\u201d There\u2019s a lot for Democrats to do if they want to impeach Trump this year (they do). Here\u2019s what comes next, from CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb: They\u2019re going to be writing a report based on the fact witnesses, beginning to write the articles of impeachment even, planning a series of hearings in the Judiciary Committee to explain the process and allowing the White House and the Intelligence Committee, among others, to present their case. The President has invited foreign powers to interfere in the US presidential election. Democrats want to impeach him for it. It is a crossroads for the American system of government as the President tries to change what\u2019s acceptable for US politicians.

            "article_content": "As prepared for delivery: Thank you Mr. Chairman for the opportunity to speak again to the Members of this Committee. First, let me offer my thanks to the men and women of the U.S. Department of State, who have committed their professional lives to support the foreign policy work of the United States. In particular, I want to thank my staff at the U.S. Mission to the European Union. Your integrity, dedication, and hardwork \u2013 often performed without public acclaim or recognition \u2013 serve as a shining example of true public service, and I am personally grateful to work beside you each and every day. It is my honor to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. The U.S. Mission to the EU is the direct link between the United States and the European Union and its members, America\u2019s longest-standing allies and one of the largest economic blocks in the world. Every day, I work to support a strong, united, and peaceful Europe. Strengthening our ties with Europe serves both American and European goals, as we together promote political stability and economic prosperity around the world. I expect that few Americans have heard my name before these events. So before I begin my substantive testimony, please let me share some of my personal background. My parents fled Europe during the Holocaust. Escaping the atrocities of that time, my parents left Germany for Uruguay, and then in 1953 emigrated to Seattle, Washington, where I was born and raised. Like so many immigrants, my family was eager for freedom and hungry for opportunity. They raised my sister and me to be humble, hardworking, and patriotic, and I am forever grateful for the sacrifices they made on our behalf. Public service has always been important to me. As a lifelong Republican, I have contributed to initiatives of both Republican and Democratic administrations. In 2003, I served as a member of the transition team for Oregon Democratic Governor Ted Kulongoski. Governor Kulongoski also appointed me to serve on various statewide boards. In 2007, President George W. Bush appointed me as a member of the Commission on White House Fellows. I worked with President Bush on charitable events for his foundation\u2019s Military Service Initiative. And I also worked briefly with former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s office in connection with the Vice President\u2019s nationwide anti-cancer initiative at a Northwest hospital. And, of course, the highest honor in my public life came when President Trump asked me to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. The U.S. Senate confirmed me as Ambassador on a bipartisan voice vote, and I assumed the role in Brussels on July 9, 2018. Although today is my first public testimony on the Ukraine matters, this is not my first time cooperating with this Committee. As you know, I have already provided ten hours of deposition testimony. I did so despite directives from the White House and the State Department that I refuse to appear, as many others have done. I agreed to testify because I respect the gravity of the moment and believe I have an obligation to account fully for my role in these events. But, I also must acknowledge that this process has been challenging and, in many respects, less than fair. I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails, and other State Department documents. And I was told I could not work with my EU Staff to pull together the relevant files. Having access to the State Department materials would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met, when, and what was said. As Ambassador, I have had hundreds of meetings and calls with individuals. But I am not a note taker, nor am I a memo writer. Never have been. My job requires speaking with heads of state and senior government officials every day. Talking with foreign leaders might be memorable to some people. But this is my job. I do it all the time. My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials. Yet, these materials were not provided to me. They have also refused to share these materials with this Committee. These documents are not classified and, in fairness, should have been made available. In the absence of these materials, my memory has not been perfect. And I have no doubt that a more fair, open, and orderly process of allowing me to read the State Department records would have made this process more transparent. I don\u2019t intend to repeat my prior opening statement or attempt to summarize ten hours of previous deposition testimony. However, a few critical points have been obscured by noise over the last few days, and I\u2019m worried that the \u201cbigger picture\u201d is being ignored. So, let me make a few key points. First, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States. We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the President\u2019s orders. Second, although we disagreed with the need to involve Mr. Giuliani, we did not believe that his role was improper at the time. As I previously testifed, if I had known of all of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s dealings or of his associations with individuals now under criminal indictment, I would not have acquiesced to his participation. Still, given what we knew at the time, what we were asked to do did not appear to be wrong. Third, let me say: precisely because we did not think that we were engaging in improper behavior, we made every effort to ensure that the relevant decisionmakers at the National Security Council and State Department knew the important details of our efforts. The suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false. I have now identified certain State Department emails and messages that provide contemporaneous support for my view. These emails show that the leadership of State, NSC, and the White House were all informed about the Ukraine efforts from May 23, 2019, until the security aid was released on September 11, 2019. I will quote from some of those messages with you shortly. Fourth, as I testified previously, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the President. Fifth, in July and August 2019, we learned that the White House had also suspended security aid to Ukraine. I was adamantly opposed to any suspension of aid, as the Ukrainians needed those funds to fight against Russian aggression. I tried diligently to ask why the aid was suspended, but I never received a clear answer. In the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma, as Mr. Giuliani had demanded. I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson. And I also shared my concerns with the Ukrainians. Finally, at all times, I was acting in good faith. As a presidential appointee, I followed the directions of the President. We worked with Mr. Giuliani because the President directed us to do so. We had no desire to set any conditions on the Ukranians. Indeed, my personal view \u2013 which I shared repeatedly with others \u2013 was that the White House meeting and security assistance should have proceeded without pre-conditions of any kind. We were working to overcome the problems, given the facts as they existed. Our only interest was to advance long- standing U.S. policy and to support Ukraine\u2019s fragile democracy. Now, let me provide additional detail specifically about Ukraine and my involvement. From my very first days as Ambassador to the EU, starting in July 2018, Ukraine has featured prominently in my broader portfolio. Ukraine\u2019s political and economic development are critical to the long-lasting stability of Europe. Moreover, the conflict in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea remains one of the most significant security crises for Europe and the United States. Our efforts to counterbalance an aggressive Russia depend in substantial part on a strong Ukraine. On April 21, 2019, Volodymr Zelensky was elected President of Ukraine in an historic election. With the express support of Secretary Pompeo, I attended President Zelensky\u2019s inauguration on May 20, as part of the U.S. delegation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The U.S. delegation also included Senator Johnson, Ukraine Special Envoy Kurt Volker, and Lt. Col. Alex Vindman of the National Security Council. My attendance at President Zelensky\u2019s inauguration was not my first involvement with Ukraine. As I testified previously, just four days after assuming my post as Ambassador in July 2018, I received an official delegation from the government of then-Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko. This meeting took place at the U.S. Mission in Brussels and was pre-arranged by my career EU Mission staff. Later, in February 2019, I worked well with U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in making my first official visit to Ukraine, for a U.S. Navy visit to the strategic Black Sea port of Odessa. I raise these prior Ukraine activities \u2013 the meeting in Brussels and my visit to Odessa \u2013 to emphasize that Ukraine has been a part of my portfolio from my first days as U.S. Ambassador. Any claim that I somehow \u201cmuscled\u201d my way into the Ukraine relationship is simply false. During the Zelensky Inauguration on May 20, 2019, the U.S. delegation developed a very positive view of the new Ukrainian government. We were impressed by President Zelensky\u2019s desire to promote a stronger relationship with the United States. We admired his commitment to reform. We were excited about the possibility of Ukraine making the changes necessary to support greater Western economic investment. And we were excited that Ukraine might, after years of lip service, finally get serious about addressing its well-known corruption problems. With that enthusiasm, we returned to the White House on May 23 to brief President Trump. We advised the President of the strategic importance of Ukraine and the value of strengthening the relationship with President Zelensky. To support this reformer, we asked the White House for two things: first, a working phone call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky; and, second, a working Oval Office visit. In our view, both were vital to cementing the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, demonstrating support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, and advancing broader U.S. foreign policy interests. Unfortunately, President Trump was skeptical. He expressed concerns that the Ukrainian government was not serious about reform. He even mentioned that Ukraine tried to take him down in the last election. In response to our persistent efforts to change his views, President Trump directed us to \u201ctalk with Rudy.\u201d We understood that \u201ctalk with Rudy\u201d meant talk with Mr. Rudy Giuliani, the President\u2019s personal lawyer. Let me say again: We weren\u2019t happy with the President\u2019s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani. I believed then, as I do now, that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for Ukraine matters. Nonetheless, based on the President\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the efforts to schedule the White House phone call and White House visit between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, which was unquestionably in our foreign policy interest \u2013 or we could do as President Trump had directed and \u201ctalk with Rudy.\u201d We chose the latter course, not because we liked it, but because it was the only constructive path open to us. Over the course of the next several months, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I were in communication with Mr. Giuliani. Secretary Perry volunteered to make the initial calls with Mr. Giuliani, given his prior relationship. Ambassador Volker made several of the early calls and generally informed us of what was discussed. I first communicated with Mr. Giuliani in early August. Mr. Giuliani emphasized that the President wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into corruption issues. Mr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two topics of importance to the President. We kept the leadership of the State Department and the NSC informed of our activities. That included communications with Secretary of State Pompeo, his Counselor Ulrich Brechbuehl, and Executive Secretary Lisa Kenna within the State Department; and communications with Ambassador John Bolton, Dr. Fiona Hill, Mr. Timothy Morrison, and their staff at the NSC. They knew what we were doing and why. On July 10, 2019, senior Ukrainian national security officials met with Ambassor Bolton, Ambassador Volker, Dr. Hill, Secretary Perry, myself, and many others in Washington, D.C. During that meeting, we all discussed the importance of the two action items I identified earlier: (1) a working phone call and (2) a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky. From my perspective, the July 10 meeting was a positive step toward accomplishing our shared goals. While I am now aware of accounts of the meeting from Dr. Hill and Lt. Col. Vindman, their recollections of those events simply don\u2019t square with my own or with those of Ambassador Volker or Secretary Perry. I recall mentioning the pre-requisite of investigations before any White House call or meeting. But I do not recall any yelling or screaming as others have said. Instead, after the meeting, Ambassador Bolton walked outside with the group, and we all took pictures together on the White House lawn. Most important, those recollections of protest do not square with the documentary record of our interactions with the NSC in the days and weeks that followed. We kept the NSC apprised of our efforts, including, specifically, our efforts to secure a public statement from the Ukrainians that would satisfy President Trump\u2019s concerns. For example, on July 13, just three days after the July 10 meeting, I emailed Tim Morrison. He had just assumed Dr. Hill\u2019s post as NSC Eurasia Director, and I met him that day for the first time. I wrote to Mr. Morrison (with these exact words): \u201cThe call between Zelensky and Potus should happen before 7/21. (Parliamentary Elections) Sole purpose is for Zelensky to give Potus assurances of \u2018new sheriff\u2019 in town. Corruption ending, unbundling moving forward and any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently. Goal is for Potus to invite him to Oval. Volker, Perry, Bolton and I strongly recommend.\u201d Morrison acknowledged, said \u201cThank you,\u201d and specifically noted he was \u201ctracking\u201d these issues. Again, there was no secret regarding moving forward and the discussion of investigations. Moreover, I have reviewed other State Department documents \u2013 some of which are not currently in the public domain \u2013 detailing Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts. For example, on July 10, 2019 \u2013 the very same day that Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry, and I were meeting with Ukraine officials in Washington \u2013 Ambassador Taylor received a communication that Mr. Giuliani was still talking with Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko. In WhatsApp messages with Ambassador Volker and I, Ambassador Taylor wrote to us as follows: \u201cJust had a meeting with Andriy and Vadym,\u201d referring to Ukraine Foreign Minister Vadym Pristaiko. Taylor said the Ukrainians were, quote: \u201cVery concerned about what Lutsenko told them \u2013 that, according to RG\u201d \u2013 meaning Rudy Giuliani \u2013 \u201cthe ZE- POTUS meeting will not happen.\u201d Volker responded, \u201cGood grief. Please tell Vadym to let the official USG representatives speak for the U.S. [L]utsenko has his own self-interest here.\u201d Taylor confirmed that he had communicated that message to the Ukrainians. He added, \u201cI briefed Ulrich this afternoon on this,\u201d referring to State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl. Three things are critical about this WhatsApp exchange. First, while the Ukrainians were in Washington at the White House, Mr. Guiliani had been communicating with Ukrainians without our knowledge. Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and I were all surprised by this. Second, Mr. Giuliani was communicating with the reportedly corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor Lutsenko and discussing whether a Zelensky-Trump meeting was going to happen, again without our knowledge. And third, with this alarming news, Ambassador Taylor briefed Ulrich Brechbuehl, who is the Counselor to Secretary of State Pompeo. Even as late as September 24, Secretary Pompeo was directing Kurt Volker to speak with Rudy Giuliani. In a WhatsApp message, Kurt Volker told me in part: \u201cSpoke w Rudy per guidance from S.\u201d S means the Secretary of State. We tried our best to fix the problem, while keeping the State Department and the NSC closely apprised of the challenges we faced. On July 25, 2019, Presidents Trump and Zelensky had their official call. I was not on the call. In fact, I first read the transcript on September 25, the same day it was publicly released. All I had heard at the time was that the call had gone well. Looking back, I find it very odd that neither I, nor Ambassador Taylor, nor Ambassador Volker ever received a detailed read-out of that call with the Biden references. Now, there are people who say they had concerns about that call. No one shared any concerns about the call with me at the time, when it would have been very helpful to know. On July 26, 2019, Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and I were all in Kiev to meet with President Zelensky. The timing, immediately after the call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, was entirely coincidental. The Kiev meetings had been scheduled well before the date of the White House call was eventually fixed. During our Kiev meeting, I do not recall President Zelensky discussing the substance of his July 25 call with President Trump. Nor did he discuss any request to investigate Vice President Biden (which we all later learned was discussed on the July 25 call). This is consistent with the reported comments from Ambassadors Volker and Taylor. After the Zelensky meeting, I also met with Mr. Zelenksy\u2019s senior aide, Andriy Yermak. While I do not recall the specifics of our conversation, I believe the issue of investigations was probably a part of the agenda. Also on July 26, shortly after our Kiev meetings, I spoke by phone with President Trump. The White House, which has finally shared certain call dates and times with my attorneys, confirms this. The call lasted five minutes. I remember I was at a restaurant in Kiev, and I have no reason to doubt that this conversation included the subject of investigations. Again, given Mr. Giuliani\u2019s demand that President Zelensky make a public statement about investigations, I knew that the topic of investigations was important to President Trump. We did not discuss any classified information. Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call. For the most part, I have no reason to doubt their accounts. It is true that the President speaks loudly at times. It is also true that we discussed A$AP Rocky. It is true that the President likes to use colorful language. While I cannot remember the precise details \u2013 again, the White House has not allowed me to see any readouts of that call \u2013 the July 26 call did not strike me as significant at the time. Actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the President\u2019s concerns. However, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended. I know that members of this Committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a \u201cquid pro quo?\u201d As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes. Mr. Giuliani conveyed to Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and others that President Trump wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing to investigations of Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians. Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to us. We all understood that these pre- requisites for the White House call and White House meeting reflected President Trump\u2019s desires and requirements. Within my State Department emails, there is a July 19 email that I sent to Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Brian McCormack (Perry\u2019s Chief of Staff), Ms. Kenna, Acting Chief of Staff and OMB Director Mick Mulvaney (White House), and Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s Senior Advisor Robert Blair. A lot of senior officials. Here is my exact quote from that email: \u201cI Talked to Zelensky just now\u2026 He is prepared to receive Potus\u2019 call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will \u2018turn over every stone\u2019. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about a \u2018friendly and productive call\u2019 (no details) prior to Ukraine election on Sunday.\u201d Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney responded: \u201cI asked NSC to set it up for tomorrow.\u201d Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19, days before the Presidential call. As I communicated to the team, I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to \u201crun a fully transparent investigation\u201d and \u201cturn over every stone\u201d were necessary in his call with President Trump. Also on July 19, 2019, in a WhatsApp message between Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and me, Ambassador Volker stated: \u201cHad breakfast with Rudy this morning \u2013 teeing up call w Yermak Monday. Must have helped. Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation \u2013 and address any specific personnel issues \u2013 if there are any.\u201d On August 10, 2019, Mr. Yermak (Zelensky\u2019s Presidential Advisor) texted me as follows: \u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.\u201d The following day, August 11, I sent an email to Counselor Brechbuhl and Lisa Kenna, addressing Secretary Pompeo with the subject \u201cUkraine.\u201d I wrote: \u201cMike \u2013 Kurt and I negotiated a statement from Ze[lensky] to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation. Ze plans to have a big presser on the openness subject (including specifics) next week.\u201d Lisa Kenna replied: \u201cGordon, I\u2019ll pass to S,\u201d meaning Secretary Pompeo. \u201cThank you.\u201d Again, everyone was in the loop. On August 26, shortly before his visit to Kiev, Ambassador Bolton\u2019s office requested Mr. Giuliani\u2019s contact information. I sent Ambassador Bolton the information directly. I was first informed that the White House was withholding security aid to Ukraine during conversations with Ambassador Taylor on July 18, 2019. However, as I testified before, I was never able to obtain a clear answer regarding the specific reason for the hold, whether it was bureaucratic in nature \u2013 which often happens \u2013 or reflected some other concern in the interagency process. I never participated in any of the subsequent DOD or DOS review meetings that others have described, so I cannot speak to what was discussed in those settings. Nonetheless, before the September 1 Warsaw meeting, the Ukrainians had become aware that the security funds had yet to be disbursed. In the absence of any credible explanation for the hold, I came to the conclusion that the aid, like the White House visit, was jeopardized. In preparation for the September 1 Warsaw meeting, I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to- face conversation between Trump with Zelensky could help break the logjam. Specifically, on Thursday, August 22, I emailed Secretary Pompeo directly, copying Secretariat Kenna. I wrote: \u201cShould we block time in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for Potus to meet Zelensky? I would ask Zelensky to look him in the eye and tell him that once Ukraine\u2019s new justice folks are in place ([in] mid-Sept[ember), that Ze should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to Potus and to the US. Hopefully, that will break the logjam.\u201d Secretary Pompeo replied, \u201cYes.\u201d I followed up the next day asking to \u201cget 10-15 min on the Warsaw sched[ule] for this.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d like to know when it is locked so that I can call Zelensky and brief him.\u201d Executive Secretary Kenna replied, \u201cI\u2019ll try for sure.\u201d Moreover, given my concerns about the security aid, I have no reason to dispute that portion of Senator Johnson\u2019s recent letter, in which he recalls conversations he and I had on August 30. By the end of the August, my belief was that if Ukraine did something to demonstrate a serious intention to fight corruption, specifically addressing Burisma and 2016 server, then the hold on military aid would be lifted. There was a September 1 meeting with President Zelensky in Warsaw. Unfortunately President Trump\u2019s attendance at the Warsaw meeting was cancelled due to Hurrican Dorian. Vice President Pence attended instead. I mentioned to Vice President Pence before the meetings with the Ukrainians that I had concerns that the delay in aid had become tied to the issue of investigations. I recall mentioning that before the Zelensky meeting. During the actual meeting, President Zelensky raised the issue of security assistance directly with Vice President Pence. The Vice President said he would speak to President Trump about it. Based on my communications with Secretary Pompeo, I felt comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. Yermak. In a very brief pull-aside conversation, that happened within a few seconds, I told Mr. Yermak that I believed that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many weeks. As my other State Department colleagues have testifed, this security aid was critical to Ukraine\u2019s defense and should not have been delayed. I expressed this view to many during this period. But my goal, at the time, was to do what was necessary to get the aid released, to break the logjam. I believed that the public statement we had been discussing for weeks was essential to advancing that goal. I really regret that the Ukrainians were placed in that predicament, but I do not regret doing what I could to try to break the logjam and to solve the problem. I mentioned at the outset that, throughout these events, we kept State Department leadership and others apprised of what we were doing. State Department was fully supportive of our engagement in Ukraine affairs, and was aware that a commitment to investigations was among the issues we were pursuing. To provide just a couple of examples, on June 5, 2019, the day after the U.S. EU Mission hosted our Independence Day event, Acting Assistant Secretary Phillip Reeker sent an email to me, Secretary Perry, and others forwarding some positive media coverage of President Zelensky\u2019s presence at our event. Mr. Reeker wrote: \u201cThis headline underscores the importance and timeliness of Zelenskyy\u2019s visit to Brussels, and the critical\u2014perhaps historic\u2014role of the dinner and engagement Gordon coordinated. Thank you for your participation and dedication to this effort.\u201d Months later, on Tuesday, September 3, 2019, I sent Secretary Pompeo an email to express my appreciation for his joining a series of meetings in Brussels following the Warsaw trip. I wrote: \u201cMike, thanks for schlepping to Europe. I think it was really important and the chemistry seems promising. Really appreciate it.\u201d Secretary Pompeo replied on Wednesday, September 4: \u201cAll good. You\u2019re doing great work; keep banging away.\u201d State Department leadership expressed total support for our efforts to engage the new Ukrainian administration. I\u2019ve never doubted the strategic value of strengthening our alliance with Ukraine. And at all times, our efforts were in good faith and fully transparent to those tasked with overseeing them. Our efforts were reported and approved. Not once do I recall encountering objection. It remains an honor to serve the people of the United States as their U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. I look forward to answering the Committee\u2019s questions.",

            "article_content": "Roger Stone\u2019s criminal trial exposed on Thursday a pile of lies in texts and emails Stone sent to or received from others \u2013 with testimony peppered by Stone\u2019s foul-mouthed written insults and one witness\u2019 sense of humor. In all, the day in court largely focused on how prosecutors believe Stone lied to Congress and how he then pressured his associate, comedian and radio host Randy Credico, to do the same. It also offered a window into how the self-described political \u201cdirty trickster\u201d mistreated others in private, all while pushing for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Stone is on trial in Washington for charges that include lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing a congressional proceeding in a case that stems from former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Stone has denied all wrongdoing. During Thursday\u2019s proceedings, prosecutors showed line charts illustrating the contacts between Stone and top Trump campaign officials. But that teaser of evidence was overtaken by hours of lively testimony by Credico, whose testimony is expected to continue Friday. Roger Stone trial reopens questions about Trump's 2016 actions Prosecutors appeared to be using Credico\u2019s testimony to flesh out the details of Stone\u2019s supposed \u201cbackchannel\u201d to WikiLeaks in 2016 and the relationship between the two men. At times, Credico was misleading Stone, then Stone was threatening Credico, according to testimony and several messages shown to the jury. The lies about Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks who had announced a cache of stolen documents that could hurt Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, started after Stone publicly said he was communicating with Assange in August that year. Credico testified that, following Stone\u2019s statement, he tried to book Assange on his radio show. \u201cHe was a great person to have on the show,\u201d Credico said about Assange. \u201cThis would be a huge catch at my station.\u201d He got the interview. Later, Stone helped Credico book Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson on his show too. After thanking Stone at the time, Credico offered to help him. \u201cWhat can I do as a quid pro quo, as it\u2019s going around these days,\u201d Credico called the exchange, an apparent reference to the ongoing impeachment inquiry now facing Trump. That\u2019s when Stone asked him to get in contact with Assange so the WikiLeaks founder could appear on Stone\u2019s radio program. But Credico testified Thursday he couldn\u2019t actually make that happen. Credico continued to mislead Stone, by implying to him he was reaching Assange about WikiLeaks\u2019 Democratic email releases. Credico, for instance, had written an email to Stone on September 18, 2016, saying \u201cthat batch probably coming out in the next drop \u2026 I can\u2019t ask them favors every other day. I asked one of his lawyers \u2026 they have major legal headaches riggt (sic) now \u2026 relax.\u201d But Credico told the jury Thursday that he had no inside information. During another exchange, prosecutors highlighted how Credico told Stone he had passed a message to Assange. \u201cHad you actually passed a message to Julian Assange?\u201d prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Credico responded. Credico also testified that when he went to London in 2016, he dropped a letter off at the Ecuadorian Embassy asking Assange to do a live radio show from inside the embassy. But Credico didn\u2019t ever get in touch with Assange, according to his testimony. \u201cSomebody put their hand out, like \u2018Thing\u2019 from \u2018Addams Family,\u2019 \u2026 and grabbed the letter. But I didn\u2019t get inside the door,\u201d Credico said. Stone allegedly falsely told the House Intelligence Committee that Credico had been his backchannel to Assange. But prosecutors allege Stone had a different person, author and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, attempting to get in touch with the WikiLeaks founder to help the Trump campaign. In addition to being a witness who speaks to Stone\u2019s lying charges, Stone also allegedly threatened Credico, pressuring him to lie to Congress. At one point, prosecutors showed what Stone\u2019s lawyers told the House in a letter. Yet Stone had shown Credico a different version of the letter. A prosecutor highlighted during testimony Thursday how drastically Stone shifted his story and sent abusive texts and emails to Credico as he allegedly withheld information and documents from House investigators about his attempts to reach WikiLeaks in 2016. Stone had actually told his associate Corsi to get to Assange in 2016, but instead told the House that Credico was his backchannel to WikiLeaks. After Stone testified on the Hill, he sent scores of emails to Credico, threatening him and peppering his texts and emails with foul and explicit language. Credico had gotten a House subpoena in late 2017, and Stone implied he should lie to the House and told him to assert his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, according to testimony Thursday. \u201cBecause of Trump, I could never get away with asserting my Fifth Amendment right,\u201d Stone told Credico, adding he believed Credico could, according to the written evidence presented at trial. During testimony, a former FBI agent who worked on the case said Credico emailed Stone eight times between March 2018 and May 2018 insisting that it was wrong for Stone to have told the House he was a backchannel to WikiLeaks. Over a series of text messages, Credico confronted Stone on asking him to cover Stone\u2019s alleged perjury. Credico pointed out to Stone, via text, that he wasn\u2019t a backchannel, but Stone had told the House committee he had a backchannel. Stone responded, \u201cWhat the f*** is your problem. Neither of us has done anything wrong or illegal.\u201d Credico then wrote, \u201cYou open yourself up to the six counts of perjury,\u201d according to the text messages. \u201cI\u2019m getting you the best press of your life,\u201d Stone said. Stone also suggested several times that Credico should lie to the House, invoking a character from \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d who lied to Congress in the film. \u201cRoger stone this, Roger stone that,\u201d Stone wrote to Credico, referencing a line from the movie. This message was sent around the time Credico had received a House subpoena and had told Stone about it. Stone then twice mentions to Credico \u2013 with major misspellings \u2013 Frank Pentangeli, the character from the movie who lies to Congress. During Thursday\u2019s trial, prosecutors shared for the first time audio of Stone testifying in a closed-door House Intelligence Committee interview in which he allegedly lied. During the testimony, he flatly denied he had communications with his associates \u201cin connection with Russian collusion.\u201d But a member of the committee reminded him that they also sought a broader range of information, anything that could relate to their investigation. \u201cI believe we have fully complied with your request,\u201d Stone replied. The House Intelligence Committee pressed Stone about who his \u201csource\u201d was who had contact with Assange, which he had discussed with Infowars founder Alex Jones, according to the audio. When pressed by the committee, Stone cited \u201cjournalistic privilege\u201d because his conversation with a journalist was \u201coff the record,\u201d he said during his testimony. \u201cIt would be better for everybody, including me, if I could tell you his name,\u201d he said. During the Mueller investigation, the House Intelligence Committee voted to provide a transcript of this interview to Mueller when he requested it. It\u2019s unknown who prosecutors may call as the next witness against Stone. But several prominent former Trump campaign officials, including Steve Bannon and Rick Gates, are on deck to testify, positioning the trial to focus more in the coming days on Stone\u2019s connections to Trump in 2016. Federal prosecutors on Thursday highlighted the volume of conversations Stone had with then-candidate Trump and other top officials from his campaign throughout 2016. Prosecutors attempted to paint a detailed image of who Stone spoke to and when as the first witness, a former FBI agent who worked on the Stone case, wrapped up her testimony. Stone\u2019s contacts with then-top Trump campaign official Paul Manafort spiked in April 2016, according to one chart used in court with yellow, green and blue lines depicting Stone\u2019s communications with the campaign each month. Stone\u2019s evident conversations with Trump were much less than his conversations with Manafort and Manafort\u2019s deputy Gates, but he still communicated with Trump a handful of times leading up to the election. The chart played a relatively small role in the prosecution\u2019s rollout of evidence Thursday. Former FBI agent Michelle Taylor\u2019s testimony has focused more on Stone\u2019s alleged witness tampering \u2013 how he threatened Credico several times over text and email \u2013 and what he told the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017 about his supposed \u201cbackchannel\u201d to WikiLeaks. Credico\u2019s comments from the witness box drew laughter at times from the audience and light scolding from the judge. At one point, Credico launched into retelling the backstory of how he and Stone had a falling out around 2011, which occurred after Stone circulated a rumor that Credico had died of an overdose, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a big practical joke, but my friends and family did not find it a joke,\u201d said Credico. During another exchange, prosecutors pulled up a list of impressions Credico can do, prompting Credico to offer to do some \u2013 such as presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 but the judge refused. \u201cWe know you are a comedian, but this is serious,\u201d Judge Amy Berman Jackson said. Credico was asked if he had ever done an impression of Frank Pentangeli, the character from \u201cThe Godfather: Part II,\u201d for Stone. \u201cI don\u2019t recall doing Frank Pentangeli\u201d for Stone, Credico said. Inside the courtroom, jurors and some people in the gallery were laughing at some of Credico\u2019s responses. But Stone\u2019s party, including his wife and daughter, didn\u2019t appreciate the humor. Zelinsky, the prosecutor, was patient with Credico\u2019s bombastic answers but kept glancing at the clock when Credico would launch into a tangent. The prosecution will call Credico back on Friday to finish his testimony. The judge dismissed the jury, telling them not to research or discuss any information about the case, \u201cnot even downloading \u2018The Godfather\u2019 on Netflix,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "The underpaid and overworked lawyers on Capitol Hill will have their turn in the spotlight on Wednesday, as Daniel Goldman and Steve Castor emerge from their temporary home in the basement of the Capitol to publicly question for the first time key witnesses in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. For over a month, Goldman and Castor led the questioning of witnesses in the private impeachment proceedings, gathering information into whether Trump abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to launch two politically beneficial probes, while using a coveted White House meeting and nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage. The House Intelligence committee have invited Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, a top State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy, to be their first witnesses to testify in public. Each hearing will begin with chairman Adam Schiff, Rep. Devin Nunes, the top ranking Republican, and their counsels \u2014 Goldman and Castor \u2014 to question witnesses for up to 90 minutes (two sets of 45 minutes for each side of the aisle) before other members of Congress get their chance. Democrats chose Taylor and Kent as their first two witnesses because they saw \u201cthe full timeline\u201d and \u201cthe full scope\u201d of Trump\u2019s \u201cmisconduct,\u201d according to a House Democratic aide. In October, Taylor contradicted Trump\u2019s view that there was no quid pro quo, testifying that it was his \u201cclear understanding\u201d that \u201csecurity assistance money would not come until the President (of Ukraine) committed to pursue the investigation,\u201d citing conversations with White House and State Department officials who have since corroborated his account. Taylor also said that Trump wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cgo to a microphone\u201d to announce the investigations. Goldman, the panel\u2019s senior adviser for the Democrats, and Castor, the House Oversight committee\u2019s general counsel for the Republicans, have been key figures in the inquiry, guiding witnesses through their timelines, urging them to describe in detail what they learned when and following up with short, pointed questions. In hundreds of pages of testimony released by the Intelligence committee, it\u2019s clear Goldman and Castor were keen to learn about the two investigations Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani sought: one into Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine that employed former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter on its board, and another into an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of Hilary Clinton. The US intelligence community has found that Russia interfered in that election to boost Trump. During Taylor\u2019s testimony, Castor asked the ambassador whether it\u2019d be appropriate to investigate Burisma and reopen corruption cases there and whether Ukraine attempted to intervene in the 2016 election. Goldman asked Taylor about the role of Giuliani in pushing for the investigations and whether Taylor understood that the White House meeting and aid would be conditioned to them. While Republicans and Democrats have usually been cordial behind closed doors, they\u2019ve sparred over questions surrounding the identity of a government whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry, according to the transcripts. After a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky, the whistleblower submitted a complaint charging that Trump \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election.\u201d Democrats have shut down Republican efforts to ask questions they think could reveal the whistleblower. While Goldman and Castor now share a common experience in the middle of the impeachment inquiry, they come from different backgrounds. Castor is a veteran of the House Oversight Committee, serving under five Republicans since 2005. In that time, Castor has been a key player on a number of investigations, including into the Justice Department\u2019s botched gun trafficking operation known as Fast and Furious, the IRS targeting of conservative organizations, the Trump White House overriding security clearance denials and other high-profile probes. Castor\u2019s skill set was deemed so valuable that he was added to the Intelligence Committee so that he could participate in the impeachment hearings. He was \u201calmost the sole survivor\u201d of Rep. Jason Chaffetz\u2019s \u201cpurge\u201d of staffers formerly under Rep. Darrell Issa due to his expertise and experience, according to Issa. \u201cEveryone said that he was just too good a lawyer not to have,\u201d Issa told CNN. Castor continued to rise under his next two bosses, Reps. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio. Issa noted that Castor could have cashed out years ago and gone to a firm to represent those who come before Congress. \u201cThat\u2019s not what drives him,\u201d Issa said. \u201cHe\u2019s an institutionalist.\u201d Goldman is not, but he has ample other experience. Schiff hired Goldman earlier this year, following a couple years as an NBC legal analyst and a ten-year career as Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York. Elie Honig, a CNN contributor who overlapped with Goldman at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, said on Twitter that he and Goldman worked on case to try mobsters on racketing and murder charges. \u201cDan and I tried a Genovese Family Boss and two hitmen on a case involving RICO, two murders, one attempted murder, and two murder conspiracies. (All guilty, now doing life),\u201d tweeted Honig. \u201cHe\u2019ll do fine.\u201d Brooke Cucinella and Goldman were in charge of the prosecution of Billy Walters in a $43 million insider trading scheme. Cucinella said Goldman \u201cknows how to get to the point,\u201d unlike some members of Congress. \u201cWhen politicians are doing these things, there tends to be a fair amount of grandstanding and self-serving statements,\u201d Cucinella told CNN. \u201cI think Danny, being a SDNY prosecutor, knows that there are facts that are important and then there are things that are not \u2014 and he will focus on what is important and move on.\u201d Cucinella also laughed at the recollection of one of his off-brand TV segments in 2018, in which Goldman shared with Megyn Kelly the story of his own marriage proposal. \u201cWe all tease him about his multiple appearances on TV and his celebrity status,\u201d Cucinella said. \u201cBut I think this is sort of a return to the core of what he\u2019s done for most of his career.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The impeachment inquiry is going public, a pivotal step for House Democrats as they try to make their case to the country that President Donald Trump should be the third president in US history to be impeached. Seven weeks after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry, her party\u2019s members are bringing in three witnesses to testify publicly. The Democrats are trying to illuminate their case that Trump abused his office by pressuring the Ukrainian President to announce an investigation that would benefit Trump politically, while withholding a one-on-one meeting and $400 million in security aid. Republicans, meanwhile, are turning from protesting the impeachment process to arguing that the Democrats\u2019 case simply doesn\u2019t add up, since Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky both say there was no pressure campaign and that Ukraine ultimately received the aid money. The first impeachment hearing kicks off Wednesday with Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, the State Department\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs. It\u2019s a high-stakes affair for everyone involved, from the President to the witnesses to pair of congressional aides who will be thrust into the spotlight. Here\u2019s what to watch for when the gavel drops in the hearing room: The last time the Democrats held what was billed as a make-or-break hearing for impeachment, the result was a flop. That was former special counsel Robert Mueller, whose testimony was intentionally limited in what he was willing and able to say about the President\u2019s connection to Russian election interference and obstruction of justice. Now the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort has shifted 180 degrees away from Mueller, after the Ukraine issue burst into the open following an anonymous whistleblower complaint alleging the President had solicited help from Ukraine with his 2020 campaign. Still, despite the different subject matter \u2013 and the public polling on impeachment, which starkly shifted in the Democrats\u2019 favor as the Ukraine issue unfolded \u2013 Democrats face the same hurdles with the Ukraine hearings as they did with Mueller. This is what the whistleblower's attorney told House Republicans who asked client to testify in impeachment inquiry The witnesses have already been questioned for hours behind closed doors and their transcripts have been released, meaning there are unlikely to be any bombshells or significant new developments in the public testimony. Instead, Democrats are going to look to Taylor, Kent and other witnesses to spell out to a nationwide audience what most people probably have yet to read in detail: that Trump, along with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, withheld a one-on-one meeting and millions in US security aid in order to persuade Zelensky to go to a microphone, as Taylor testified, to announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. The inquiry started with a whistleblower complaint, but Democrats say they\u2019ve collected so much evidence they don\u2019t even need to hear from that individual, arguing that the 15 witnesses who have testified all point to a Ukraine shadow diplomacy spearheaded by Giuliani, which first led to the ouster of US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and then prompted the push for an investigation and the freeze on US aid. A Democratic aide said Democrats are telling a \u201cvery simple story\u201d that the President abused his office and his presidential powers. Democrats are betting that in this case, unlike with Mueller, the \u201cmovie version\u201d of the testimony playing out in a hearing room will successfully bring the story to life for people who didn\u2019t \u201cread the book.\u201d Democrats passed a House resolution last month dictating the rules of the public hearings, making a key adjustment to a traditional hearing: The chairman and ranking GOP member of the House Intelligence Committee will each get 45-minute blocks to ask questions. The rules change was an effort to counteract a frustration that\u2019s emerged from many recent high-profile hearings, including Mueller and the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings in the Senate: that the five-minute back-and-forth questioning between members of the two parties leads to disjointed, hard-to-follow narratives.  Democrats hope the 45-minute blocks will give them the time to walk witnesses through their full stories like they were able to do in the closed-door depositions, where the majority and minority alternated hourlong and 45-minute rounds. The format also means that Democrats will get to lay out their case with the witness for a full 45 minutes without GOP interruption, before Republicans then get to do the same to try to push back against the Democratic arguments. It\u2019s a format that was also used during the impeachment hearings for President Bill Clinton two decades ago. The rules include another key distinction to allow Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and ranking Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, also of California, the ability to tap committee staff attorneys to ask questions, which both are expected to do. That means that two relatively unknown congressional aides \u2013 Daniel Goldman, the Intelligence Committee\u2019s director of investigations, and Steve Castor, the House Oversight Committee GOP counsel \u2013 will be two of the most prominent faces in the public impeachment hearings. Goldman and Castor have led questioning during the closed-door depositions, so they will be well prepared for their moment, even if the notion of outshining lawmakers at hearings will be a foreign one. The Republicans even made Castor a shared aide for the Oversight and Intelligence committees to allow him to participate. For weeks, House Republicans have decried the closed-door Democratic impeachment process, accusing Schiff of running an illegitimate, secretive inquiry to overturn the results of the 2016 election. Now that the inquiry is out in the open, Republicans are shifting their strategy to focus more on the substance of the Democratic narrative in an attempt to undercut the case for impeachment. Republicans on Monday circulated an 18-page memo detailing their argument against impeachment with four core points: While Republicans aren\u2019t likely to drop fully their complaints about the process \u2013 especially if the witnesses they requested are denied by the Democrats \u2013 the public hearings aren\u2019t expected to include major shenanigans like the effort led by GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to \u201cstorm\u201d the House Intelligence secure space last month to protest the impeachment inquiry. Now that the Republicans effectively got what they asked for \u2013 open hearings \u2013 they have to try to win their argument on the substance. Of course, they\u2019ve already been attempting to do just that behind closed doors in the depositions, despite Trump\u2019s false claims on his Twitter feed that Republicans have been shut out of the process or that the transcripts are somehow doctored. The public takeaway that comes out of the impeachment hearings will depend in large part on the witnesses sitting across from lawmakers: longtime career officials who remain at the State Department. The officials all expressed concern and alarm at the campaign led by Giuliani to remove Yovanovitch and then to push for political investigations. Republicans will look to question the witnesses\u2019 credibility and reliability in order to undercut Democratic arguments. That doesn\u2019t mean Republicans will necessarily try to attack witnesses \u2013 this isn\u2019t Michael Cohen testifying \u2013 but they will look to poke holes in the arguments witnesses put forward. That\u2019s particularly true of Taylor, who says he was told that Trump would not meet with Zelensky or release the Ukraine security aid unless the Ukrainian President publicly announced investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election. Taylor\u2019s account is based on what he was told by other officials, such as US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and National Security Council aide Tim Morrison. Republicans plan to build the case in their line of questioning that Taylor didn\u2019t have a \u201cclear understanding\u201d of what Trump wanted, and point to the fact he relied on what he had been told by others to argue that Taylor\u2019s account should not be given more weight than those of witnesses with more direct involvement, like former US Special Envoy Kurt Volker, who said he did not see a quid pro quo with Ukraine. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a New York Republican who has been a key participant in the depositions, said Tuesday that Taylor was not credible because his account was based on \u201csecond-, third- (and) fourth-hand information.\u201d Democrats, however, are likely to point to the fact that Taylor\u2019s account has been corroborated by other witnesses, including Morrison, who did not take issue with the July 25 call itself. And Taylor explained in his deposition that he took meticulous notes of his conversations \u2013 meaning his account of what happened over the past few months was not as hazy as others, like Sondland. The question of witness credibility will be key for every public impeachment hearing, but perhaps none more than the first day with Taylor. If he comes across as credible and compelling, it will go a long way to helping Democrats make their impeachment case. This is the first social media impeachment proceeding, and the first where the President\u2019s Twitter feed gives him the ability to respond unfiltered and in real time to the televised hearings. Trump has tweeted repeatedly on impeachment in recent weeks, with frequent attacks on Schiff and Pelosi, questions about why the whistleblower isn\u2019t coming forward and complaints that Democrats are trying to impeach him over a \u201cperfect\u201d phone call. His Twitter feed will be a wild card for both sides. What\u2019s more, the President has a joint news conference scheduled with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following their meeting at the White House on Wednesday, giving him a potentially prominent platform to respond to the impeachment hearings. Trump\u2019s news conference could create quite the split screen for day one of the public hearings. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump oversees a toxic West Wing and attempts to use his office to settle scores \u2013 including with the state of California and former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 according to a new book by an anonymous author identified only as a senior administration official. Painting the White House as a snake-pit of D-list opportunists, the unnamed writer claims Trump oversees a shambolic operation where staffers are out mainly for themselves. The President, the unnamed author known as \u201cAnonymous\u201d writes, is equally amoral, using the power of the presidency for political gain and ignoring attempts by his aides to moderate his approach. \u201cNo external force can ameliorate his attraction to wrongdoing,\u201d the author writes in the forthcoming book \u201cA Warning,\u201d excerpts of which were obtained by CNN on Monday. \u201cThe net effect of the president\u2019s war on democratic institutions is that he has turned the government of the United States into one of his companies,\u201d Anonymous says, \u201ca badly managed enterprise defined by a sociopathic personality in the c-suite, rife with infighting, embroiled in lawsuits, falling deeper into debt, allergic to internal and external criticism, open to shady side deals, operating with limited oversight, and servicing its self-absorbed owner at the expense of its customers.\u201d New accounts depict White House struggling to contain damage from Trump chaos The claims made in book echo what ousted officials have said publicly and what Democrats are currently probing in their impeachment efforts. The description of an administration in chaos is recounted in sworn testimony from several named witnesses in the inquiry. But the anonymous author provides more grist to the notion Trump is governing untethered to presidential \u2013 or possibly legal \u2013 norms, and that his White House is populated by sharp elbows. The writer says Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden\u2019s son \u2013 currently the focus of congressional investigators pursuing impeachment \u2013 derived from his fixation on his own political standing. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in Ukraine. \u201cWith the campaign consuming his daily mental bandwidth, Trump couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to use his office to gain a competitive edge,\u201d the author writes, without providing any fresh evidence that Trump engaged in a quid pro quo to exchange US military assistance for Ukraine\u2019s cooperation in the investigations. Trump\u2019s pursuit of political score-settling occurs closer to home, the unnamed author says, citing his attempts to punish states that swung for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThe president surprises staff with horrifying ways to make life difficult for these parts of America,\u201d Anonymous writes, naming California as particularly prone to Trump\u2019s personal requital. \u201cTrump hates California. He can\u2019t believe that an entertainer such as himself is unable to win over the home of Hollywood.\u201d The Golden State animus extended to a demand to staff to cut off emergency funding during last year\u2019s wildfires, according to the book. Aides tried to contain the damage, even as Trump was raising the idea with \u201crandom people.\u201d They thought the storm had passed \u2013 only to have Trump tweet weeks later that he was halting the flow of dollars. The book \u2013 which goes on sale November 19 and is published by Twelve, a division of the Hachette Book Group \u2013 is authored by the same unnamed senior administration official who wrote a New York Times op-ed last year. At the time, Trump called the action \u201ctreasonous.\u201d Washington Post: Nikki Haley says top Trump aides tried to recruit her to undermine President Sources familiar with the book have previously confirmed to CNN that the publisher and the author\u2019s literary agents were provided verification that the author of the book and op-ed is the same person. The White House has flatly rejected the claims in the book, and in a statement to CNN on Monday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said \u201cthe book as written presents a portrait that is the exact opposite of what the President actually is.\u201d \u201cIf this person has in fact been inside White House meetings, or has any access to the President, he is acting like a spy. This person is a gutless coward, who doesn\u2019t have the spine to put his or her name to their shameful lies,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cThis corrupt scheme to undermine our President with deceit is an attempted overthrow of our democracy and an assault on our great Nation. There is no heroism in using anonymity to tell lies that only serve to hurt a country, while \u2018donating\u2019 the profits to the media in an obvious effort to purchase favorable coverage - also called a bribe.\u201d As Trump enters the final year of his first term, he finds himself surrounded with fewer aides willing to deny or reject his demands, the author writes. Instead, he\u2019s amassed a collection of officials with ulterior motives \u2013 \u201cthe cast of characters grew seedier\u201d \u2013 with little interest in containing the President. \u201cThere are fewer people left to reject the folly of these ideas, and those that do are written off by the president as disloyal,\u201d the author writes. Acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is depicted as a hands-off enabler who angled for months to get the post and whose main goal is \u201cmaking bad ideas for palatable, to soften their rough edges.\u201d The book isn\u2019t the only new release to suggest there were once officials in Trump\u2019s administration working to counteract some of his more damaging impulses. Former United Nations envoy Nikki Haley writes in her new memoir that two onetime officials \u2013 former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-chief of staff John Kelly \u2013 attempted to recruit her to \u201csave the country\u201d by undermining the President\u2019s decisions, a request she refused. Both those officials are gone, and the unnamed writer suggests the current makeup of the Trump administration is both more amateurish and more backstabbing. \u201cThe cannibalistic culture is deterring good people from coming on board,\u201d the author writes.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has had a week! Transcripts of closed-door testimony from a series of witnesses in front of the House Intelligence Committee seem to affirm the idea that a quid pro quo was in place between the US and Ukraine. He was ordered by a judge in New York to pay $2 million as restitution for using his Trump Foundation charity as a slush fund for his political interests. Elections in Kentucky and Virginia suggested Democratic momentum in 2018 hasn\u2019t worn off. He lost an appeal to keep his taxes from being released. And on and on it goes. And so it was a very frustrated President who greeted reporters Friday morning before jetting off to Atlanta. I went through the transcript of Trump\u2019s remarks \u2013 they stretched for almost a half hour \u2013 and took note of some of his more outlandish lines. They\u2019re below. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 1. \u201cI just told them I\u2019ve got to come over and see the fake news. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I feel like this suggests Trump reads my recaps of his press conferences and speeches. Speaking of which: And away we go! 2. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about anything.\u201d Same. 3. \u201cI mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are.\u201d This is, of course, an outlandish statement. Trump \u201chas never even heard\u201d of the former US ambassador to Ukraine? Give me a break. 4. \u201cThey\u2019re some very fine people. You have some never-Trumpers. It seems that nobody has any firsthand knowledge. There is no firsthand knowledge.\u201d Ok, two things here. First, there is ZERO evidence that any of the people who testified in the House impeachment hearings are \u201cNever Trumpers.\u201d Second, National Security Council Ukraine expert Alexander Vindman, whose testimony was released Friday, was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And he immediately reported the call as inappropriate to his superior. 5. \u201cAnd all that matters is one thing: the transcript. And the transcript is perfect.\u201d (Narrator voice) It isn\u2019t. 6. \u201cWell, they shouldn\u2019t be having public hearings. This is a hoax. This is just like the Russian witch hunt. This is just a continuation.\u201d Trump never elaborates on why he believes the House shouldn\u2019t have public hearings on impeachment. (Those hearings are slated to start next week.) But, if he truly believes they are a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d wouldn\u2019t he want that to be exposed by public hearings? 7. \u201cI saw he said very nice things about me last night. But we\u2019ll have to see. I\u2019ll have to see.\u201d Trump, asked about Jeff Sessions\u2019 just-announced Senate bid, proves \u2013 yet again \u2013 that all he does is watch cable TV news. 8. \u201cI had a very good call with the President of Ukraine. I assume that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about. The call was perfect.\u201d I know I have been over this ground before but \u2026 what, exactly, constitutes a \u201cperfect\u201d phone call? Is it about the contents of the call? The execution? The connection clarity? 9. And all you have to do is take a look at Biden and you will see tremendous corruption because what he did is quid pro quo times 10.\u201d There is zero evidence of any wrongdoing by Joe Biden vis a vis the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor. Biden, in his service as vice president, was the face of a broad coalition effort to have the prosecutor dismissed due to concerns about his unwillingness to investigate corruption. Those are the facts. 10. \u201cBe quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.\u201d Just the President of the United States telling a reporter to stop asking a question. Very normal stuff! Nothing to see here, folks! 11. \u201cAlabama is a place where my approval numbers are very good. I think I won by 42 points.\u201d (Narrator voice) It was 28 points. 12. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. I mean, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d This is Trump on whether there will be a China trade deal. Also, he says \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d when he has no idea what to say. 13. \u201cWell, now, you\u2019ve really shaped my behavior, because from the day I came in here, I\u2019ve had problems with phony stuff, like a phony dossier that turned out to be false, like false investigations that I\u2019ve beaten. So a lot of my behavior was shaped by the fake news and by the other side. That was a lot of my behavior.\u201d This is demonstrably false. Even a cursory look at Trump\u2019s life before politics shows the same pattern of behavior he\u2019s shown in office: Bullying, vindictive and always, always spinning things in his favor. 14. \u201cI caught the swamp. I caught \u2018em all.\u201d (Stifles laughter) 15. \u201cI caught all of this corruption that was going on, and nobody else could have done it.\u201d (Snorts) 16. \u201cMy charity was great. I gave a lot of money away.\u201d Former New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said that her investigation of the Trump Foundation produced \u201ca shocking pattern of illegality involving the Trump Foundation \u2014 including unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.\u201d So, yeah \u2013 \u201cgreat.\u201d 17. \u201cNew York is a corrupt state. It\u2019s a corrupt state, it\u2019s a shame.\u201d Wait, wait. Isn\u2019t Trump President of all 50 states? Including New York? 18. \u201cI gave $19 million away. And what happened is, instead of saying, \u2018Thank you, great,\u2019 they hit me with a lawsuit and it was started by a man who had to get out because he beat up women.\u201d The man in question here is former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman resigned his post in May 2018 amid allegations by several women that he assaulted them. Worth noting here that Trump faced a slew of allegations of sexual harassment from more than a dozen women in the run-up to the 2016 election. 19. \u201cI had a call. I\u2019m sure it was fine. I mean, you know, I have to \u2013 I make a lot of calls.\u201d Honestly, same. 20. \u201cI\u2019m very transparent. Nobody is more transparent than I am.\u201d Donald Trump was the first major party candidate in modern memory to refuse to release any of his past tax returns. He is also the first president post-Watergate to refuse to do so. So, yeah. 21. \u201cAnd if I wasn\u2019t and if I didn\u2019t release it, it would have been a problem, because the fake whistleblower said something about the call, many things that were wrong.\u201d Nothing that has come out publicly disputes the original eight-page complaint by the whistleblower. In fact, everything we have learned since has bolstered the initial complaint. 22. \u201cLet \u2013 let me just tell you, I \u2013 I hardly know the gentleman.\u201d Ha, ha, ha\u2026oh wait, he isn\u2019t joking. Trump is talking here about Gordon Sondland. Yes, the same Sondland who donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and was rewarded with an posting as the US ambassador to the European Union. Never heard of him! 23. \u201cEverybody that\u2019s testified, even the ones that are Trump haters, they\u2019ve all been fine. They don\u2019t have anything.\u201d So many ways to go with this but I\u2019ll head down this path: There is NO evidence that any of the people have testified are \u201cTrump haters\u201d or have feelings either way about the President. He is just making stuff up. 24. \u201cAnd if I asked Bill Barr to have a press conference I think he\u2019d do it, But I never asked him to have a press conference. Why should I?\u201d Truly amazing stuff here. Trump didn\u2019t ask the attorney general to hold a press conference to clear him of any wrongdoing in the Ukraine matter \u2013 as the Washington Post has reported he did. But, if he had asked, Barr would have done it. Sure! 25. \u201cThey lost an election and they lost it big.\u201d (narrator voice) Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million. 26. \u201cAnd, interestingly, if you look at the polls that just came out, my polls are up.\u201d This is, again, simply false. 27. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you, the whistleblower, I call him the fake whistleblower. He gave a fake report of my phone call.\u201d I am going to record myself saying: \u201cNothing the whistleblower alleged has been proven incorrect or inaccurate in any way.\u201d And then just hit \u201cPLAY\u201d over and over and over again. 28. \u201cMy phone call was perfect. He made it sound bad. That\u2019s why I had to release.\u201d The transcript just doesn\u2019t say what Trump thinks it says. 29. \u201cSo the whistleblower is a disgrace to our country. A disgrace. And the whistleblower, because of that, should be revealed.\u201d This is truly stunning stuff. The whistleblower followed procedures put in place for just this thing. And (hits PLAY)  \u201cNothing the whistleblower alleged has been proven incorrect or inaccurate in any way.\u201d And yet Trump is saying the person is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and urging his or her identity be revealed. Chilling stuff. 30. \u201cAnd his lawyer, who said the worst things possible two years ago, he should be sued. And maybe for treason. Maybe for treason.\u201d The whistleblower\u2019s lawyer should be charged with treason?!?! For what, exactly? Oh, Trump doesn\u2019t explain. 31. \u201c(Schiff) made up a speech and he put my voice in it. He made up a speech, had nothing to do with what I said.\u201d Trump has latched onto this argument, which is so dumb and so easily proven false. Please read this about that. I beg you. 32. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone out and they\u2019ve gone out of their way to find the people that hate Donald Trump, President Trump, the most.\u201d No. Evidence. Any. Witnesses. Hate. Trump. 33. \u201cWe are winning so big. My polls are the highest they\u2019ve ever been, I\u2019m leading in all of the states, every swing state.\u201d (Head explodes) 34. \u201cNancy Pelosi should go back to her district, which is horrible. It\u2019s filthy. It\u2019s drug-infested. The stuff\u2019s being flown out to the ocean \u2013 it\u2019s being wiped out to the ocean through their drainage systems.\u201d Reminder: Donald Trump is President of the people in Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district too! 35. \u201cWe\u2019re doing very well with African Americans.\u201d In a CNN national poll in September, 9% of African Americans approved of the job Trump was doing as compared to 86% who disapproved. 36. \u201cI know Michael. He became just a nothing. He was really a nothing. He\u2019s not going to do well, but I think he\u2019s going to hurt Biden, actually. But he doesn\u2019t have the magic to do well.\u201d Michael Bloomberg: he just doesn\u2019t have the magic. 37. \u201cLittle Michael will fail. He\u2019ll spend a lot of money. He\u2019s got some really big issues. He\u2019s got some personal problems and he\u2019s got a lot of other problems.\u201d Modern day presidential. 38. \u201cThere is nobody I\u2019d rather run against than Little Michael.\u201d Trump, for what it\u2019s worth, has said this same thing about Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and virtually the entirety of the Democratic field. 39. \u201cJust so you know, we have the highest poll numbers. We have the most energy.\u201d Uh huh. 40. \u201cI have to do what the lawyers say, to a certain extent; not always, but, you know, to a certain extent.\u201d Oh yeah. I get it \u2013 to a certain extent. This feels like a good place to end.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump and his allies are bracing for open hearings that will preoccupy Washington and bring to life the vivid picture of presidential behavior that until now has been confined to written statements and private testimony. As Democrats move toward the public phase of their inquiry with an eye to boosting support for Trump\u2019s impeachment, White House officials are gripping for another consequence: a President consumed by the developments. Trump has already found the specter of impeachment hard to ignore, interspersing references to the \u201cscam\u201d he believes Democrats are pursuing into nearly every White House meeting and set of unrelated public remarks. He has browbeat Republicans into remaining unified, though election losses in Virginia and an apparent narrow victory for Democrats in Kentucky\u2019s governor race have provided little evidence of Trump\u2019s political capital. But with only brief glimpses of the stone-faced witnesses walking into the secure basement hearing room, neither Trump nor the general public has been able to fully assess their recounting of his approach to Ukraine. Now, the President will learn along with the rest of the country what members of his own administration are saying about how he pressed Ukraine to investigate a political rival. Key diplomat changes testimony and admits quid pro quo with Ukraine The power of televised hearings has been something of a subplot to the Trump presidency, from James Comey to Brett Kavanaugh to Robert Mueller. But never have they come with the imminent threat of impeachment, or any real consequence beyond damaged political reputations and negative news cycles. The hearings announced on Wednesday carry higher stakes. Since the open testimony was first floated by Democrats, the White House has worked with its Republican allies on Capitol Hill to try and formulate a way both to respond to the testimony and to use the public forum to cast the proceedings as illegitimate. The White House is expected to do what it has for past high profile public hearings: live monitoring of the public hearing, frequent real time updates to staff and frequent dissemination of talking points to surrogates. Two new advisers \u2013 former Treasury official Tony Sayegh and former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi \u2013 have been in the process of joining the President\u2019s team for days, and are expected to be in place before the public hearings begin next week. The White House Counsel\u2019s office has looked at various options in handling the public interviews, gaming out a strategy for defending the President against accusations he used a hold in military aid to Ukraine to spur investigations into political rivals. The White House lawyers have poured through transcripts from the closed-door depositions as they build their case, trying to determine what to expect from the public phase. A dramatic reversal splinters Trump's impeachment defense Some of the prospective witnesses have given Trump\u2019s allies more heartburn than others. In recent days, there was a heightened level of concern inside the White House about an appearance from the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. His deposition behind closed doors that alleged an explicit quid pro quo was seen as one of the most damaging to Trump\u2019s case. White House officials have viewed Taylor as more credible than other witnesses who detailed the President\u2019s approach to Ukraine and have been told by Republicans on Capitol Hill that he could be the hardest to discount. White House officials were under the impression Democrats would save his testimony for last. Instead, he\u2019s up first \u2013 one week from Wednesday. Taylor\u2019s word won\u2019t be easy to dismiss. He\u2019s a West Point graduate, Vietnam veteran and was personally recruited by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the job \u2013 a job that text messages published Tuesday by House investigators revealed he was extremely reluctant to take given the involvement of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine matters. Taylor remains in his post as the top US diplomat in Kiev, another reason why some officials believe his word will carry more weight than some witnesses who have left the administration, like former National Security Council official Fiona Hill or Ambassador Kurt Volker, the one-time US special envoy to Ukraine. After Taylor testified, Trump privately grumbled to Pompeo and blamed him for his hire. He later publicly said that Pompeo made a mistake by doing so, rare criticism for one of his favorite Cabinet members. That response, paired with Trump\u2019s general agitation at the closed-door impeachment proceedings, has led some officials inside the White House to wonder how he\u2019ll react to the televised version. The law puts Trump in charge of enforcing whistleblower protections In private conversations, the President has been discussing with aides and allies the intelligence whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s unclear if Trump knows the identity of the person, but even in public he has pressured the news media and his allies to release the name, prompting howls of objection from the attorneys representing the whistleblower. During the last high-profile investigation into the President \u2013 former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe \u2013 Trump was largely glued to his television screen during days with public congressional testimony. Then, Trump often watched the proceedings unfold from the comfort of the White House residence or the dining room just off the Oval Office, live-tweeting throughout. Until now, Trump hasn\u2019t had that distraction during the impeachment process. On Wednesday, as US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland\u2019s damaging testimony was publicly released, the President carried on with his regular schedule of meetings, according to a senior White House official. He did not tweet about the testimony released Wednesday until Thursday morning, when he took to his favorite social media platform to tout Volker\u2019s ignorance of a quid pro quo as vindication. And instead of the President\u2019s foul mood trickling down to the mood in the West Wing, officials also carried on largely unperturbed, though many were reading updates about the testimony. \u201cNobody\u2019s really shaken by any of this,\u201d a senior White House official said on Wednesday night, insisting the mood in the building was the same in the morning as it was when officials filtered out of the White House. Trump's audacious, reelection-focused impeachment defense There is also a growing sense of invincibility among many top White House officials who have watched as past efforts to investigate Trump have floundered. Neither congressional investigations nor the special counsel\u2019s investigation left much of a mark on Trump, leaving some White House officials similarly dismissive of the impeachment investigation. Some are banking on the public not fully understanding all the different threads in the impeachment inquiry, and not caring enough for it to move the needle. Their view is the twists in the inquiry are too complicated for average Americans to grab hold in any significant way. A Trump adviser on Tuesday downplayed the idea that Sondland\u2019s testimony or the release of the other transcripts add up to a serious blow for Trump. \u201cHardly gaining steam,\u201d this adviser said. \u201cDemocrats start in a position of weakness.\u201d The President\u2019s political advisers have already begun to capitalize on the galvanizing nature of the proceedings among Trump\u2019s base by mining Trump supporters for donations and stirring up resentment of Democratic efforts to get Trump out of office. At his rally Monday evening in Kentucky, supporters lined up behind him wearing t-shirts emblazoned with \u201cRead the Transcript,\u201d a message Trump has told his allies is effective in countering Democrats\u2019 claims of wrongdoing. And officials remain confident that while impeachment is inevitable, Democrats will be incapable of rallying enough Republican senators to remove Trump from office. During a lunch with Republicans senators on Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence offered a familiar-sounding piece of advice for the lawmakers in the room who have struggled with a viable defense strategy: read the transcript. The vice president urged the lawmakers in the room to point out that the Trump administration has provided Ukraine with lethal aid and he advised them to simply refer back to the transcript when facing questions about the President\u2019s conduct. The advice is not new and comes as some senators have complained to the White House that they need a better defense strategy. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democrats have launched a critical new phase of their impeachment investigation by releasing first transcripts of witness depositions as they seek to build a public case that President Donald Trump abused his power in a rogue foreign policy operation in Ukraine. Three committees investigating the scandal released transcripts and summaries of closed-door interviews with the former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The move signals the start of a shift from closed-doors investigation of Trump\u2019s covert Ukraine policy into an attempt to convince Americans that he should be removed from office in dramatic televised hearings. Signs that the release of testimony was imminent prompted Trump to issue a torrent of personal abuse against House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, that was extraordinarily personal even by his own standards. This is what changed Adam Schiff's mind on impeachment \u201cHouse Republicans must have nothing to do with Shifty\u2019s rendition of those interviews. He is a proven liar, leaker & freak who is really the one who should be impeached!\u201d Trump tweeted. In the testimony released on Monday, Yovanovitch said she was shocked and felt threatened after learning that Trump attacked her on a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \u201cbad news.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it meant. I was very concerned. I still am,\u201d Yovanovitch said in the interview conducted on October 11. The release of testimony came after it became clear that at least six executive branch insiders due to give depositions over the next few days would not show up. But this week could still have a sting in the tail. Former national security adviser John Bolton, a fiery figure who was recently fired by Trump, is due to testify on Thursday \u2013 though there are doubts over whether he will appear. A Bolton sighting would spark a frenzy since other witnesses have testified that he decried Trump\u2019s decision to outsource Ukraine policy \u2013 a caper one former senior official said he referred to as a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d No one could be sure what Bolton might say. Would he stay loyal to his former boss or to the iconoclastic approach to foreign policy that steered him through a colorful career in Washington? \u201cI like John Bolton. I always got along with him,\u201d Trump said Sunday, misrepresenting his relationship with the renowned Washington bruiser in a possible sign of concern about his potential testimony. Asked whether Bolton speak up, Trump replied: \u201d \u2026 that\u2019s going to be up to him.\u201d Democrats believe they have built a strong case that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate a domestic rival \u2013 Democratic 2020 candidate Joe Biden \u2013 during weeks of depositions featuring career officials. But if executive branch officials due to testify this week do not show up, they may reach a point when there is little to be gained by holding off a more visible phase of the inquiry. Party leaders believe they already have a strong enough case to go ahead without holdout witnesses, though more evidence could further bolster their confidence. All four White House officials scheduled for House inquiry depositions Monday won't testify All four White House officials who are scheduled to give depositions on Monday during the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry won\u2019t show up, as a source with knowledge of the situation tells CNN that National Security Council lawyers John Eisenberg and Michael Ellis will not testify. The two officials will join Robert Blair, assistant to the President and senior adviser to the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Brian McCormack, associate director for natural resources, energy & science at the Office of Management and Budget, in not testifying on Monday, CNN reported earlier. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was scheduled to appear Wednesday, will not participate in a closed door deposition, an Energy Department spokesperson said Friday. Bolton\u2019s lawyer has said he will not appear without a subpoena. But it\u2019s not clear if he will testify even if he is served. And since Democrats have said they will not allow the impeachment drive to be bogged down in legal challenges like the one that could be necessary to force Bolton\u2019s compliance, they may move ahead without him. Democrats have also warned that they will consider Trump administration attempts to block testimony by officials as a sign of obstruction that could be folded into articles of impeachment. When the full House returns after a week-long break next Monday, two weeks will remain before the Thanksgiving recess \u2013 a potential window for public hearings. In the normal course of events, the schedule for next week\u2019s committee business would be announced by the middle of this week. Democrats hope to bring back important witnesses \u2013 for example the top US diplomat in Kiev, Bill Taylor, who they believe will help them build a devastating picture of presidential malfeasance and unconstitutional behavior. House Foreign Affairs committee chairman Eliot Engel laid out the theory of the case \u2013 and a challenge to Republicans who want to shield Trump, in a television appearance on Sunday. \u201cNo other president in American history has done something like that,\u201d Engel said on ABC News \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cHe tried to essentially bribe a foreign power to interfere in US elections on his side to go after one of his political opponents,\u201d Engel argued. Lawyer says whistleblower willing to answer written questions from Republicans In a new development over the weekend, lawyers for the intelligence community whistleblower who first raised alarm about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine said their client was willing to answer written questions directly from Republicans without going through the Democratic majority. The unidentified official\u2019s legal team has warned about threats to his safety. And Democrats now say their case is so strong that the whistleblower may not be needed to testify in public. But Steve Scalise, the number two ranked House Republican, called for the whistleblower to testify to the committees investigating impeachment, complaining that \u201csomebody behind closed doors, in secret\u201d was \u201ctrying to take out a sitting president.\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, says written answers from the anonymous whistleblower are not sufficient, and said lawmakers need to hear from the whistleblower in person. \u201cWritten answers will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts and cross examine the so-called Whistleblower. You don\u2019t get to ignite an impeachment effort and never account for your actions and role in orchestrating it. We have serious questions about this individual\u2019s political bias and partisan motivations and it seems Mark Zaid and Adam Schiff are attempting to hide these facts from public scrutiny. Last week\u2019s testimony raised even more concerns about the anonymous whistleblower and our need to hear from them, in person,\u201d Jordan said in a statement. The Republican struggle to counter the facts of the case leaking out of the hearings was reflected in the scattershot defenses made by Trump loyalists on Sunday talk shows. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said she didn\u2019t know whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine \u2013 the key matter at issue in the case. But she stood by the White House response that there was no quid pro quo between Trump and the former Soviet state. \u201cPresident Trump never said to the Ukrainian President \u2018do this and you\u2019ll get your aid.\u2019 It is simply not here,\u201d she said, referring to a rough transcript of a July 25 call between Trump and the President of Ukraine. \u201cQuid pro quo, yes or no?\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asked Conway. \u201cI just said to you. I don\u2019t know whether aid was being held up and for how long,\u201d Conway replied. Kellyanne Conway says 'I don't know' if Trump held up Ukraine military aid Republican lawmakers tried out various lines of defense for the President, who has reportedly been frustrated that he is not being defended on the merits of the case. \u201cLook, if I believed everything the Democrats are saying I would still say this isn\u2019t an impeachable offense,\u201d said Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Cole is a nine-term veteran who once ran the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm and was a campaign consultant earlier in his career. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to do this on a phone call? I mean, I just don\u2019t think this rises to the level,\u201d he said. The case that Democrats are building relates to far more than the phone call between the two Presidents. Leaks from depositions suggest that senior officials believe there was a long-running scheme to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden and a conservative conspiracy theory that Kiev and not Russia interfered in the 2016 election. But arguing that Trump\u2019s conduct does not meet the high crimes and misdemeanors standard for impeachment could be a viable path for Republicans caught between conservative grass roots support for the President and personal disquiet about his behavior. Such an approach is not sitting well with Trump however, whose life code precludes any admission of wrongdoing and argued Sunday that the July call was \u201cperfecto\u201d and \u201ctotally appropriate.\u201d \u201cFalse stories are being reported that a few Republican Senators are saying that President Trump may have done a quid pro quo, but it doesn\u2019t matter, there is nothing wrong with that, it is not an impeachable event. Perhaps so, but read the transcript, there is no quid pro quo!\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday.

            "article_content": "The top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, will \u201cfulfill his duty\u201d and return to Capitol Hill to testify publicly if asked, according to a source familiar with his thinking, making him a potential key early witness for Democrats as they shift their impeachment inquiry into a public phase. There has not been a request yet made for Taylor to testify publicly, according to the source, and Taylor is now focused on his duties in Ukraine. Taylor\u2019s lawyers said Wednesday night that no decision had been made. \u201cAmbassador Taylor has not been asked to appear and therefore has not made any decision about future testimony.  He continues to perform his duties as a government official,\u201d his lawyers told CNN. But Democrats privately say that Taylor would be a logical choice for one of the first witnesses when the House begins public impeachment hearings. He meticulously documented how he believed the White House had linked Ukraine\u2019s announcing an investigation that could help the President politically with unfreezing of US security aide and a one-on-one meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The House on Thursday will vote on a resolution that will formalize the rules for the impeachment inquiry and set the stage for public hearings in the House Intelligence Committee. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, has declined to comment on which witnesses he will bring in or when the hearings will start, but lawmakers and aides say that a timetable where hearings begin next month before Thanksgiving is feasible, though not finalized. Democrats believe that Taylor, a career diplomat who has worked for administrations of both parties, will be an unassailable witness with detailed notes and an impeccable memory. They believe he\u2019s someone who will tell a story to the public authoritatively about why efforts to provide aid to Ukraine and bolster relations with that key ally were delayed amid the push by Trump to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 elections. His 15-page opening statement delivered some of the most dramatic and damning testimony that Democrats have heard thus far. \u201cHe\u2019s rock solid, detailed notetaker and unimpeachable,\u201d said Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cFifty years given to his country \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get much more \u2018Top Gun\u2019 than that.\u201d But the Republican strategy for the open hearings also is coming into focus. They plan to zero in on the lack of direct contact with Trump \u2013 and contend that the diplomats\u2019 concerns were merely stating their own personal opinions. It\u2019s a key argument they\u2019ll make with Taylor, who told lawmakers he never met with Trump one-on-one, according to a source familiar with his testimony. \u201cA lot of that information is based off of second-, third- and even fourth-hand information,\u201d said New York Rep. Lee Zeldin, who has been a Republican spokesman following many of the depositions. Zeldin said Taylor\u2019s remarks contained \u201conly two references in his opening statement to the Bidens,\u201d and that the reference to investigating the Bidens came to Taylor from his conversation with National Security Council staffer Tim Morrison who was told by US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. Taylor, however, also testified that Sondland told him directly that \u201ceverything\u201d was conditioned on a public announcement, and that Trump had said he wanted Zelensky \u201cin a public box\u201d on the investigation. Republicans say they\u2019re ready for public hearings. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about anybody in a public setting,\u201d said Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, a GOP member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who has participated in the closed depositions. \u201cIf you think the President has done something wrong, you\u2019re going to see that in the witness testimony. If you think the President hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, you\u2019re going to see that in the witness testimony.\u201d  Perry added: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about any of them testifying because the facts are the facts. Most of this is opinion. These people have diverging opinions \u2013 that\u2019s their right to have it. But quite honestly, the President is within his rights to do any of these things.\u201d Taylor is one of several witnesses whom Democrats may ask to return as they move from gathering information behind closed doors in their investigation to presenting that information to the public to make the case for impeaching a President for just the third time in US history. They\u2019re also interested in other witnesses who can corroborate the account that Trump pushed for Ukraine to open an investigation while holding up security aid \u2014 as well as to press Sondland about discrepancies they see in his account from his conversations with Taylor and White House meetings on Ukraine. Sondland\u2019s lawyer did not reply to a request for comment when asked if he would be willing to return to testify publicly. Schiff\u2019s office declined to comment on Taylor\u2019s potential testimony. Taylor\u2019s opening statement provided a preview of what kind of witness he would be for Democrats publicly. He was unequivocal that he believed US aid to Ukraine was being held up as Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani pushed for an investigation \u2014 and he took detailed notes. \u201cAccording to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland that he was not asking for a \u2018quid pro quo.\u2019 But President Trump did insist that President Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself,\u201d Taylor testified. While Democrats seized on Taylor\u2019s comments to say he\u2019d laid out a quid pro quo, Taylor didn\u2019t want to say so explicitly himself during his closed-door testimony, according to multiple sources familiar with this testimony. In a previously unreported exchange, Schiff asked Taylor if the deal was essentially that Zelensky needed to announce investigations and then he would get the White House visit and security assistance, and Taylor said yes, according to the sources. Schiff then asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that the very definition of a quid pro quo?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t speak Latin,\u201d Taylor responded, according to the sources. He said that was a legal conclusion \u2014 he was there to provide the facts \u2014 and he would let the lawmakers draw those legal conclusions. Sources told CNN that when Republicans questioned Taylor, one of the things they focused on was his relationship with Morrison, who is scheduled to testify behind closed doors Thursday. While Republicans initially tried to cast them as friends, Taylor said he had never met Morrison before they both ended up in these roles, according to one source. They also tried to get at the idea that it would be improper for Morrison to convey to Taylor what Sondland said about his conversation with Trump, but Taylor explained that was Morrison\u2019s job. Taylor did not record any of his phone calls, one source said, but he\u2019s been a note-taker his whole life and had extensive notes of his conversation with Sondland, Morrison and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent. The items that he quoted in his opening statement were quotes from his notes or from WhatsApp messages, the source said. While Schiff and other committee leaders have been tight-lipped on which witnesses could make public appearance, Democrats say there will be several weeks of public hearings \u2014 and likely return witnesses. Those hearings could begin next month, as the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees are working to complete all of their closed-door depositions \u2014 they have six scheduled for this week and several more on tap for next week. That schedule could still slip, however, lawmakers warn, as many of the depositions have yielded additional potential witnesses. Several Democrats have said they\u2019d been interested in hearing publicly from former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed earlier this year after Giuliani pushed for her ouster. They\u2019re also interested in Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia adviser, who reported her concerns about Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine push and testified that former national security adviser John Bolton compared the effort to a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council Ukraine expert who testified Tuesday that he reported his concerns about the July 25 phone call, would give Democrats a firsthand witness who was on the call between Trump and Zelensky. Multiple sources said that Vindman could be a good witness, but he also appeared nervous when he appeared behind closed doors Tuesday. The sources said Vindman seemed a bit unprepared for the moment at first, but then he got into a groove with his responses during the question-and-answer portion of the deposition. Morrison, who is scheduled to testify behind closed doors Thursday, could also be a key witness, as he\u2019s cited in Taylor\u2019s opening statement more than a dozen times. And Democrats have also said they want to hear again from Sondland, who had told Taylor there was \u201cno quid quo pro\u201d in a text message after speaking to Trump. His testimony appeared to contradict other witnesses, particularly surrounding a July 10 meeting on Ukraine, and Democrats want him to return to clarify it. Schiff would not say Tuesday whether he would try to bring Sondland back. CLARIFICATION AND UPDATE: This story and its headline have been updated to reflect that Taylor will \u201cfulfill his duty\u201d to testify only if asked, and to add a statement from Taylor\u2019s lawyers.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump was relentlessly dishonest last week about the scandal over his dealings with Ukraine, making false claims about just about every component of the story. Trump made 96 false claims last week, the second-highest total of the 16 weeks we\u2019ve counted at CNN. He made 53 false claims last Monday alone \u2013 a remarkable 31 in rambling comments at his Cabinet meeting and 22 more in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. Fifty-three false claims is by far the most Trump has made in any day in the 16 weeks we\u2019ve tracked, beating the previous high of 41. Trump has averaged about 68 false claims per week over the 16-week period \u2013 just shy of 10 false claims per day. His deception last week was focused on his conduct toward Ukraine and Democrats\u2019 related impeachment inquiry. Deep breath now: He falsely claimed he had released an exact transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He falsely claimed he did not ask Zelensky for anything on the call. He falsely claimed people aren\u2019t talking about the call anymore. He falsely claimed the whistleblower complaint about the call was \u201ctotally wrong.\u201d He falsely claimed the whistleblower alleged he had made seven or eight mentions of a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d He falsely claimed the whistleblower has vanished. He falsely claimed Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff was the whistleblower\u2019s source. He falsely claimed Schiff had spoken about the call at a committee hearing before, not after, the release of the rough transcript. He falsely claimed Schiff\u2019s committee comments were illegal. He falsely claimed Republicans aren\u2019t allowed to ask questions in Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry hearings. And he falsely claimed those closed-door hearings are unprecedented. The most egregious false claim: Trump\u2019s \u201cprediction\u201d about Osama bin Laden The President complained that the media doesn\u2019t want to talk about his declaration, in a 2000 book, that Osama bin Laden needed to be killed. In fact, he didn\u2019t say anything like that. The President claimed that things would be different today if his prescient words had been listened to. Again, those words do not exist. The President claimed that he still has people coming up to him marveling at his amazing \u201cprediction\u201d about bin Laden. Again, he did not make any prediction about bin Laden. And the president claimed that it was an especially remarkable prediction because \u201cnobody\u201d had ever heard of bin Laden at the time. Bin Laden was being pursued by the CIA and had been put on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list the year before. Here\u2019s a full fact check of Trump\u2019s elaborate fiction. The most revealing false claim: How people \u201cdon\u2019t talk\u201d about his call with Ukraine\u2019s president Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky is at the center of Democrats\u2019 push to impeach him. It remains the subject of discussion in the media and in the impeachment inquiry hearings. Trump said last week: \u201cThey don\u2019t talk about it anymore.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t like to talk about the phone call,\u201d he told Hannity, \u201cbecause it was perfect.\u201d Most politicians spin, exaggerate, mislead. Trump invites people to join him in a fantasyland that bears no resemblance to what they can see with their own eyes. The most absurd false claim: George Washington\u2019s \u201ctwo desks\u201d Trump is fond of adding vivid little details to his tales to theoretically make them sound more authentic. Attempting last week to defend himself against criticism of his aborted plan to hold a G7 summit at one of his own resorts, he claimed that George Washington not only ran a business while in office \u2013 Washington was a major landowner and took an active interest in his farm, so there\u2019s at least a smidgen of truth there \u2013 but that Washington, \u201cthey say, had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk.\u201d For good measure, Trump gestured as if there were two desks near him, side-by-side. Fact checking Trump involves asking weird questions to experts who do not traditionally get roped into articles on the dishonesty of elected officials. In this case, one of our recruits was Mary Thompson, a research historian at Mount Vernon, Washington\u2019s historic home. \u201cI am not aware of Washington having had two desks in the study in the presidential mansion, which was a fairly small room,\u201d Thompson said. Here\u2019s a full fact check of this claim. And below is this week\u2019s full list of 96, starting with the ones we haven\u2019t included in a weekly update before: Trump\u2019s poll numbers \u201cAnd I had great polls. I have my best polls now. I think it\u2019s because people think that it\u2019s terrible what they\u2019re doing. Pelosi, Shifty Schiff, Schumer \u2013 these people are trying to destroy the country.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting \u201cI do say this \u2013 and I can see it, because I\u2019ve been \u2013 I mean, look at our fundraising. The money\u2019s never come in like this. Look at \u2013 my poll numbers have been, like, the highest.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: Trump did not say what polls he was referring to, but there is no sign that he is at his \u201chighest\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d level ever or that there has been any kind of spike in his numbers as a result of Democrats\u2019 impeachment push. Trump was at 41.8% approval and 54.1% disapproval in the FiveThirtyEight polling aggregate on the day of these comments, October 21. That was down from 43.8% approval and 52.1% disapproval on September 25, his recent peak. Trump was above 44% approval at various points of 2017 and 2018. Trump\u2019s approval numbers with Republicans in particular are consistently over 80%, but even these numbers were not at their peak at the time he spoke here. People crying \u201cWe revoked the ridiculous Waters of the United States rule. \u2026 When I did that, I had people in my office \u2013 I had miners and I had farmers and I had builders building homes. And many of them were tough, strong men and women. And almost all of them were crying. They said, \u2018Sir, you\u2019ve given our life back to us.\u2019\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: We checked the video of this 2017 event, and nobody standing behind Trump was crying. (Trump had previously claimed that \u201chalf\u201d of the people behind him were crying.) A report from \u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d Trump spoke three times about data on household income growth under himself and Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. He said all three times that the figures were from \u201cMoody\u2019s.\u201d Facts First: These figures were not from Moody\u2019s, company spokesman Gene Kim confirmed; they were produced by a different firm, Sentier Research. (Trump might well just have been confused \u2013 he did refer correctly to a recent Moody\u2019s analysis that found he is on track to win the 2020 election if the economy remains roughly as it is today.) The Sentier Research data had been recently referenced by Stephen Moore, an economic fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a Fox News contributor. Median household income and energy \u201cA recent analysis found that middle class income has risen by $5,000. But add to that \u2013 that\u2019s median household income \u2013 add to that $2,000 from the tax cuts and then $2,000 for energy, because our energy is much cheaper. \u2026 And so that would be $9,000 per household. Median income.\u201d \u2013 October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum Facts First: There is no basis to add \u201c$2,000 for energy\u201d on top of the $5,000 figure for median household income. The $5,000 figure came from Sentier Research, a private company run by former Census Bureau officials. The company uses a different methodology than the Census Bureau, and the Trump-era household income increase it calculated is much larger than the increase the Census Bureau itself found between 2016 and 2018. Whichever figure is more accurate, there is no credible estimate that the median household gained \u201c$2,000 for energy\u201d over and above the $5,000 overall pre-tax gain found by Sentier. Household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs. The Sentier data and inflation \u201cYou know, a number just came out \u2026 under the Bush administration, for eight years, median household income went up $400. That\u2019s over eight years. OK? So, remember: $400, eight years \u2026 so remember this: eight years, eight years, 400 bucks \u2013 400 bucks. You don\u2019t even \u2013 that gets wiped out by inflation. Four hundred dollars.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: As the Washington Post noted, Trump was incorrect that the $400 median household income increase under Bush \u201cgets wiped out by inflation.\u201d The Sentier data is already adjusted for inflation, company partner Gordon Green confirmed. The construction of the Empire State Building \u201cAmerica built the Empire State Building in just one year. Believe it or not, in nine months.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: The Empire State Building was built in 13 months, not nine months. (We\u2019d have let it go if Trump had stuck to \u201cjust one year,\u201d but nine months is objectively wrong.) The pace of road approvals \u201c\u2026 I mean, roads are under consideration for \u2013 we have roads, 21 years, 22 years. They end up costing many, many times more\u2026 But permits that took 17, 18, 19 years, we think we can get \u2013 we\u2019re down to two years. And we think we can get it around one. And you may get rejected, folks, but it\u2019s going to be fast.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: There is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for \u201croads,\u201d though he was not very specific about which roads he was talking about. According to the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page, the department\u2019s median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016. A White House report in December 2018 found an average environmental impact statement completion time of 4.5 years and median completion time of 3.6 years across the government, for various kinds of projects. Brad Karkkainen, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email that he has \u201cnever heard of a highway project taking 18 or 20 years, though it\u2019s certainly possible that when the median time was six or seven years, a few projects took twice as long, perhaps more.\u201d He said some projects can \u201csail through\u201d much faster than the median time, \u201cbut to suggest as Trump does that the typical time has gone from 17+ years to two years is just nonsense.\u201d The governor of Louisiana \u201c\u2026In Louisiana the other night, the governor was at 66 \u2013 he couldn\u2019t get 50%.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: Trump was vague here, but Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards was not \u201cat 66\u201d either in the polls or in his previous election. Edwards got 56% of the vote when he was elected in 2015; public polls listed by FiveThirtyEight did not have him higher than 55% in this year\u2019s open primary. The Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines \u201cIn my first week in office, I approved permits for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. And that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: This was not quite what happened. Trump did sign an executive order in his first week in office to advance both pipelines, but he did not grant final approval of Keystone XL until just over two months into his presidency. The Army announced during Trump\u2019s third week in office that it would grant the final permits for the Dakota Access Pipeline. A quote from Charlie Kirk \u201d \u2018\u2026 Our studends (sic) feel EMPOWERED. There\u2019s a movement happening on these campuses like I\u2019ve never seen before. When you have 3000 students wanting to get into an event that couldn\u2019t get in, that\u2019s pretty remarkable!\u2019 @charliekirk11 Turning Point USA KEEP AMERICA GREAT!\u201d \u2013 October 23 tweet Facts First: Trump\u2019s tweet omitted an important part of Kirk\u2019s quote on Fox News: Kirk\u2019s reference to protests at an event featuring himself and Donald Trump Jr. The President also added a hyperbolic statement Kirk did not utter in this quote. Introducing Kirk, the founder of conservative organization Turning Point USA, the hosts of Fox & Friends made mention of the protests around the event at Colorado State University. Kirk said: \u201cThere\u2019s a movement happening on these campuses. There were some of the protests from the non-students in the local area, but when you have 3,000 people that wanted to get but couldn\u2019t get out, that\u2019s pretty remarkable!\u201d Trump replaced Kirk\u2019s reference to the protests with his own words, \u201clike I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d A quote from Steve Doocy \u201cA majority do not want him Impeached and removed from office. 94% of the people in these battleground states who voted for President Trump want him to continue as President. That\u2019s squarely in his corner.\u2019\u201d @SteveDoocy \u2013 October 22 tweet Facts First: Trump\u2019s tweet omitted a significant part of Doocy\u2019s quote: Doocy noted that this poll showed that a majority of those polled supported House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Doocy, a co-host of Fox & Friends, actually said, \u201cA majority is for the inquiry but do not want him impeached and removed from office, and it also said that I think 94% of the people in these battleground states who voted for President Trump want him to continue as President. That\u2019s squarely in his corner.\u201d Republicans and the impeachment inquiry \u201cBut no lawyers \u2013 we have no lawyers \u2013 Republican \u2013 because it\u2019s the minority. We have no lawyers, we can\u2019t question, we can\u2019t do a thing. We can\u2019t \u2013 they can\u2019t even go into the room\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: Trump was correct that the Democratic House majority was not permitting White House lawyers into its closed hearings. However, the 48 Republican members of the three committees holding the hearings \u2013 Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight \u2013 were indeed allowed into the room, and they were given equal time to question witnesses. Trump might have been referring to a stunt in which Republicans who were not members of any of the three committees, along with some Republicans who were members, stormed the secure committee room to make a political point; the non-members were not allowed to be there. But the members were allowed to be full participants in the proceedings. Closed-door impeachment meetings \u201cWell, I think they are \u2013 I will be honest: I loved when I saw that scene of the unity yesterday with the congressmen going downstairs, because they have a cabal going on. It\u2019s \u2013 you know, you look at what\u2019s happening downstairs in the little room \u2013 that little secret room. Nobody ever had a thing like that. That\u2019s never happened before.\u201d \u2013 October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s Eric Bolling Facts First: It\u2019s not true that \u201cnobody ever had a thing like\u201d the closed-door hearings House Democrats are holding as part of their impeachment inquiry. The impeachment processes for both Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon also involved closed-door meetings in which members of Congress gathered evidence. \u201cThe President\u2019s comments are entirely, wholly, and completely, wrong,\u201d said Jeffrey Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. \u201cIt is simply normal for those discussions to take place behind closed doors because as everyone across the board will tell you, in investigations you get better answers when there are no cameras.\u201d The impeachment witnesses \u201cThey\u2019re interviewing \u2013 they\u2019re interviewing ambassadors who I\u2019d never heard of. I don\u2019t know who these people are. I never heard of them. And I have great respect for some of them. \u2026 Don\u2019t forget, many of these people were put there during Obama, during Clinton, during the Never Trump or Bush era. You know, you had a Never Trump or Bush.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: As FactCheck.org noted: \u201cActually, among the nine government officials who have testified in closed sessions so far, just two were appointed to their current or recently resigned positions under the Obama administration. The other seven were appointed by Trump or Trump appointees, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\u201d We can\u2019t definitively fact check whether Trump has heard of his own appointees, but it\u2019s worth noting that they are indeed his own appointees, that he professed respect for \u201csome of them\u201d immediately after saying he\u2019d never heard of them, and that he has a history of minimizing his relationships with former associates when that is convenient for him. Barack Obama and Kim Jong Un \u201cBut in the meantime, North Korea, I like Kim, he likes me. We get along. I respect him, he respects me. \u2018You could end up in a war.\u2019 President Obama told me that. He said, \u2018The biggest problem, I don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u2019 He told me he doesn\u2019t know how to solve it. I said, \u2018Did you ever call him?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 Actually, he tried 11 times. But the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his call. OK? Lack of respect. But he takes my call.\u2019\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: There is no apparent basis for the claim that Obama tried to call Kim Jong Un 11 times. In fact, there is no evidence that Obama called him even once. His former national security officials say he did not. Read our full fact check here. Conor Lamb and Trump \u201cSo, Conor Lamb \u2013 right here from Pittsburgh. And I appreciate \u2013 Conor, whoever you are \u2013 I have no idea what you even look like. But there\u2019s some guy named Conor Lamb who speaks very nicely about \u2013 you know why? Because you\u2019re in like a Trump district. No, it\u2019s right. It\u2019s true. Right? \u2018No, the President is excellent. He\u2019s doing a good job.\u2019 I thought he was a Republican until I found out.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: Lamb, a Democratic congressman in Pennsylvania who has positioned himself as a moderate, has made an effort to avoid attacking Trump, expressed a willingness to work with Trump, and expressed qualified support for Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum (he called for a focus on China rather than allies like Canada) \u2013 but Lamb has not called Trump \u201cexcellent\u201d or said \u201che\u2019s doing a good job.\u201d Trump has previously exaggerated how positive Lamb has been toward him, falsely claiming Lamb had endorsed the Trump tax law Lamb had campaigned against. Conor Lamb and guns \u201cThey want to take away your guns. Conor Lamb wants to take away your guns.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: There is no evidence that Lamb \u201cwants to take away your guns.\u201d Lamb says he supports universal background checks, but he opposes a ban on assault weapons and says new gun laws are not the answer to the problem of mass shootings. Obama\u2019s response to Russian election interference \u201cAnd President Obama in September (2016) was told about Russian influence, and he didn\u2019t want to do anything about it. He didn\u2019t want to do a thing about it. Because he assumed Hillary was going to win. So he didn\u2019t do a thing about it. Nobody brings that up.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: Obama has been criticized, even by some Democrats, for not acting more forcefully when he was notified of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Still, it\u2019s an exaggeration to say \u201che didn\u2019t do a thing.\u201d Obama and his senior officials did several things in response to the information. San Francisco and the environment \u201cI can\u2019t believe that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s District in San Francisco is in such horrible shape that the City itself is in violation of many sanitary & environmental orders, causing it to owe the Federal Government billions of dollars - and all she works on is Impeachment. We should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away. Very bad and dangerous conditions, also severely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply. Pelosi must work on this mess and turn her District around!\u201d \u2013 October 26 tweet Facts First: San Francisco does not owe the federal government billions of dollars over its supposed environmental violations. And the claim that pollution from San Francisco\u2019s homeless population is \u201cseverely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply\u201d is sharply disputed by environmental experts. In September, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, sent a letter to the governor of California to allege \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the state\u2019s implementation of federal environmental laws. The letter, which followed a dispute between the Trump administration and the state over automotive emissions standards, is seen by many Democrats, former EPA officials and environmental experts as retaliatory. Regardless of the administration\u2019s true motives, the letter did not allege that San Francisco or the state owes the federal government billions. It said San Francisco \u201cmust invest billions of dollars\u201d to modernize its sewer system; that is not the same thing. Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at the University of California, Los Angeles and faculty co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, noted the absence of evidence for the administration\u2019s claims about environmental problems caused by homeless people in San Francisco. \u201cTrump\u2019s tweet is misleading or flatly false on several fronts. Although he claimed in late September that the city\u2019s failure to manage its homelessness problem was causing serious water pollution problems from needles and human waste, his EPA has produced no evidence to back up its claim,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, after he made that accusation, EPA sent what is called a notice of violation to San Francisco accusing the City of violating the federal Clean Water Act in the operation of its wastewater and sewer system. EPA made no mention of any problems caused by the homeless population \u2013 you can bet if the agency had any evidence, it would have included mention of the evidence in the letter.\u201d The presidential salary \u201cBut I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I\u2019m surprised, to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Trump does donate his salary, but the rest of his claim was inaccurate. He is not the only president to have donated the official salary; both John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover did so. Washington did not. Although Washington initially declined his salary, he relented after Congress insisted. George Washington\u2019s \u201ctwo desks\u201d \u201cBut other presidents, if you look \u2013 other presidents were wealthy. Not huge wealth. George Washington was actually considered a very, very rich man at the time. But they ran their businesses. George Washington, they say, had two desks: He had a presidential desk and a business desk.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Washington, a major landowner, did continue to own property while serving as president, and he took an interest in his farm at Mount Vernon while in office \u2013 even writing to a United Kingdom official to discuss getting help finding renters for Mount Vernon land. But historians say Trump\u2019s claim about Washington having a separate desk for business work is baseless. You can read a longer fact check here. Escaped ISIS prisoners \u201cGeneral Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained.  There were a few that got out \u2013 a small number, relatively speaking \u2013 and they\u2019ve been largely recaptured.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech on the situation in Syria Facts First: Trump\u2019s anti-ISIS envoy, James Jeffrey, testified to Congress about an hour earlier that he does not know the whereabouts of the escaped prisoners. \u201cWe do not know where they are,\u201d Jeffrey, who serves as both special envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS and as special representative for Syria engagement, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Trump\u2019s statements on Iraq and oil \u201cI always used to say, \u2018If they\u2019re going to go in\u2026\u2019 Nobody cared that much, but it got written about. \u2018If they\u2019re going to go in\u2026\u2019 I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the statement, because I made it more than any human being alive. \u2018If they\u2019re going into Iraq, keep the oil.\u2019 They never did. They never did.\u201d \u2013 October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Facts First: We could not find any examples of Trump speaking before the war about keeping Iraq\u2019s oil. (The White House did not respond to a request for evidence.) As with his stance on the invasion itself, Trump appeared to be describing comments he made during the war as if he made them during the run-up to the war. There was at least slightly more factual basis for this claim than his claim to have opposed the invasion: Trump did have a history of suggesting that the US get or take Middle Eastern countries\u2019 oil. In a CNN appearance in 1987, for example, he called for the US to get a percentage of Kuwait\u2019s oil in exchange for military protection. The same year, Florida\u2019s St. Petersburg Times reported that Trump had suggested in a New Hampshire speech that \u201cthe United States should attack Iran \u2018and take over some of their oil.\u2019 \u201c But these comments were more than 15 years before the invasion of Iraq, and they were not about Iraq. You can read a longer fact check here. Trump, his book and Osama bin Laden \u201cYou know, if you read my book \u2013 there was a book just before the World Trade Center came down. And I don\u2019t get any credit for this, but that\u2019s OK. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book \u2013 a, really, very successful book. And in that book, about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, \u2018There is somebody named Osama bin Laden. You better kill him or take him out.\u2019 Something to that effect. \u2018He\u2019s big trouble.\u2019\u201d And: \u201cI think it was about \u2013 if you check, it was about a year before the World Trade Center came down. And I\u2019m saying to people, \u2018Take out Osama bin Laden,\u2019 that nobody ever heard of. Nobody ever heard of\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Facts First: Trump\u2019s January 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d mentioned bin Laden once, but it did not call for bin Laden to be killed or warn that he would perpetrate a major attack if he were not killed. In a separate section, the book said the US was in danger of a major terrorist attack that would make the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center look minor in comparison \u2013 but it did not predict that bin Laden or al Qaeda would be the perpetrator of this attack. You can read a longer fact check here. The size of China\u2019s economy \u201cSo, if I weren\u2019t elected, by right now, China would be the largest economy in the world. It was expected. It was said by many people that China would, right now \u2013 they were expecting around the second year of this term.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting \u201cWhen I took office, everybody said that China would be the largest economy in the world within the first two years. And we picked up trillions and trillions of dollars of worth, and China has lost trillions of dollars of worth.\u201d \u2013 October 23 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure Facts First: Experts on China did not declare that the Chinese economy would be larger than the American economy within two years of Trump taking office, at least not around the time Trump did take office. \u201cWhen the President took office, there were no predictions China would surpass the US in GDP within two years. Their GDP was 60% the size of the US at the time and slowing. They would have had to grow $7.5 trillion to catch us in two years even if we didn\u2019t grow at all, which would have required 30% annual increases on their part. No one would predict that,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an expert on the Chinese economy. Scissors said Trump might possibly have been thinking of three things: bad predictions at the start of the decade that China would pass the US around this time; predictions when Trump came into office that China would pass the US before the end of his hypothetical second term; figures that incorporate purchasing power parity rather than measuring the absolute size of the economies. China\u2019s economic growth \u201cWe are much bigger than the China economy. And we\u2019re getting bigger, and they\u2019re not.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: China\u2019s economy is getting bigger, though its growth has slowed. China reported 6% economic growth in the third quarter of 2019 \u2013 the weakest growth since 1992, but growth nonetheless. China\u2019s official figures are not always reliable, but there is no doubt that China is growing; the International Monetary Fund expects 6.1% growth in 2019 and 5.8% growth in 2020. Trump\u2019s strike against Syria \u201cI wiped out the caliphate. And you also saw when I hit 58 rockets, missiles right into the middle. Tomahawk, right into the middle of \u2013 of Syria and knocked out a whole base\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: A Syrian air base did indeed suffer serious damage as a result of the airstrike Trump approved in 2017, but it was not \u201cknocked out.\u201d The Shayrat base had returned to use by the next day, according to the governor of the province of Homs and a UK-based monitoring organization, Reuters reported. Trump himself acknowledged at the time that the runways had not been destroyed, tweeting: \u201cThe reason you don\u2019t generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!\u201d Hillary Clinton and trade with South Korea \u201c\u2026 as an example, we finished it with South Korea. What a difference that has made. That was a Hillary Clinton deal. She said, \u2018This will produce 250,000 jobs.\u2019 And she was right, except the jobs were produced for South Korea, not for us, OK?\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: There is no record of Clinton, who served as secretary of state, saying that the US trade deal with South Korea would \u201cproduce 250,000 jobs.\u201d Obama said the deal would \u201csupport at least 70,000 American jobs.\u201d Clinton was a key figure in the negotiations over the agreement, known as KORUS, but when Trump calls it a \u201cHillary Clinton deal,\u201d it\u2019s worth noting that the agreement was originally signed in 2007 by the George W. Bush administration. The Obama administration renegotiated some of its provisions. Touting the benefits of his Doral resort in Florida, Trump said, \u201cRight next to the airport, Miami International \u2013one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it\u2019s the biggest. But one of the biggest airports in the world.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Miami International is certainly not the biggest airport in the world. The airport was not in the top 20 for passenger traffic in 2018 or 2017. It ranked 15th in cargo traffic in 2018 and 14th in 2017, with less than half of the tonnage of cargo of top-ranked Hong Kong. Though world airports authorities do not release rankings of airports\u2019 physical size, Miami International is not even close to the largest airport in the United States. Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare, for example, occupies about 7,200 acres, Miami International 3,230 acres. \u201c\u2026you people, with this phony Emoluments Clause\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: There\u2019s nothing phony about the Constitution\u2019s prohibitions against the President receiving payments from foreign and domestic governments. The clause on foreign emoluments, found in Article I, Section 9, says that \u201cno person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.\u201d The clause on domestic emoluments, found in Article II, Section 1, says: \u201cThe President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.\u201d Trump might have been attempting to argue that it is phony to apply the clause to his own activities, but, at very least, his wording left an inaccurate impression. \u201cGeneral Michael Flynn\u2019s attorney is demanding that charges be immediately dropped after they found that FBI Agents manipulated records against him. They say that James Clapper told a reporter to \u2018take a kill shot at Flynn. This has been a complete setup of Michael Flynn. They exonerated him completely of being an agent of Russia (Recently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard & Jill Stein with the same thing-SICK), and yet Mr. Comey still runs to the White House on February 14 and conjures up the Obstruction of Justice narrative against the President when Flynn had been cleared of everything long before that. The DOJ is withholding a lot of evidence & information, as are Clapper & Brennan & all of the people who participated in the complete setup of Michael Flynn.\u2019 (Terrible!) Sidney Powell. This is a disgrace!\u201d \u2013 October 26 tweet Facts First: We give Trump significant leeway to make minor errors when he is quoting people from television, but he went too far here. Trump attributed to Powell, a lawyer for Flynn, sentences that were actually uttered by Fox & Friends hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila. He also added the parenthetical \u201cRecently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard & Jill Stein with the same thing-SICK,\u201d which nobody on the show said. You can watch the exchange here. \u201cInterior Secretary \u2013 largest landlord in the United States by a factor of about 200 \u2013 David Bernhardt. Where\u2019s David? David? Thank you, David. Stand up.  What a great job. He\u2019s basically the landlord to about half of the United States.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: We know Trump was speaking informally here, but \u201chalf\u201d is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2017: \u201cThe federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States.\u201d The land is managed by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture. \u201cAnd then after the election, The New York Times apologized for their coverage, because they were covering me in such a way. So when I won they actually apologized to their subscribers, because they were losing thousands and thousands of subscribers. The New York Times wrote an apology. Nothing else. You know, they\u2019re saying well, it wasn\u2019t really an apology. It was. Because they covered me so badly.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: The Times\u2019 letter was not an apology. The letter, from publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet, did say the election had raised several questions, including this: \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d But the letter did not issue any apology, to Trump or anyone else. Here are the claims Trump made last week that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups: The call with Zelensky Trump said of the phone call: \u201cThere was no anything asked for. There was no pressure whatsoever.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Trump is free to argue that his requests to Zelensky did not constitute \u201cpressure,\u201d but he is simply wrong that he didn\u2019t make any requests at all. Trump asked Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden, into a debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic computer servers, and to speak with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. In fact, prior to launching into the request about the server, Trump said, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d You can read a full fact check of this claim here. The rough transcript \u201c\u2026 I released a transcription then by stenographers of the exact conversation I had.\u201d  \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting \u201cSo now we have a conversation that\u2019s perfect. And it\u2019s transcribed. And it\u2019s done by totally professional people, stenographers or whatever you would call them. So we have an exact conversation.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: The document released by the White House explicitly says, on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of the call. In testimony on Tuesday, the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, said that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document, a source told CNN. The whistleblower\u2019s accuracy \u201cYou know, these whistleblowers, they have them like they\u2019re angels. OK? So do we have to protect somebody that gave a totally false account of my conversation? I don\u2019t know. You tell me. \u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting \u201cAnd now you don\u2019t hear from the whistleblower anymore, because the whistleblower was talking about this conversation \u2013 in phony terms.\u201d And: \u201cWell, now the funny thing is that they say \u2013 they say that the whistleblower \u2013 they don\u2019t need the whistleblower anymore. Why don\u2019t they need the whistleblower? You know why they don\u2019t need the whistleblower, because the whistleblower\u2019s account of my conversation was totally wrong.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cWhere is the Whistleblower, and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President?\u201d \u2013 October 24 tweet \u201cBut everything was about the Whistleblower (they no longer want the second Whistleblower either), which they don\u2019t want because the account of my call bore NO RELATIONSHIP to the call itself. The entire Impeachment Scam was based on my perfect Ukrainian call, and the Whistleblowers account of that call, which turned out to be false (a fraud?).\u201d \u2013 October 25 tweet Facts First: The whistleblower\u2019s account of the call has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower\u2019s three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here. Rep. Adam Schiff and the whistleblower \u201cSo was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be shifty Schiff. In my opinion it\u2019s possibly Schiff.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting \u201cThey don\u2019t like to talk about the \u2013 Adam Schiff said he doesn\u2019t want the whistleblower anymore. You know why? Because he might have given the whistleblower the things to say.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cWho is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!\u201d \u2013 October 24 tweet Facts First: This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower said information about the call came from \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call.\u201d Schiff did say that it might not be necessary for the whistleblower to testify. He said it might be possible to uncover critical evidence without jeopardizing the whistleblower\u2019s anonymity. The timing of Schiff\u2019s comments \u201cSo he made up a lie, and I released \u2013 they never thought that I\u2019d do this \u2013 I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had. And now the game was up.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting \u201cFor instance, when you do a censure vote on Adam Schiff, what did he do? He made up my conversation, totally \u2013 like fiction. It was \u2013 it was fraudulent. He made it sound \u2013 he took that conversation he made it sound \u2013 now, he didn\u2019t know about that conversation. So he went up \u2013 and he made up a phony conversation, read it to Congress, read it the American people. And I released that, and that was the real conversation\u2026\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cIf you think \u2013 Schiff made up, his words \u2013 not my words. He went before Congress and the American people and he repeated a conversation that I never had, and then I released the conversation, because we had stenographers and transcribers, and the conversation was a perfect conversation.\u201d \u2013 October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s Eric Bolling Facts First: Schiff made his comments about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before. Before he started claiming that Schiff did not expect a transcript to be released, Trump had complained that Schiff did not read the transcript available to him. Even Trump\u2019s friendly interviewer here, Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity, seemed to be gently correcting him, noting that the conversation \u201cwas already out\u201d when Schiff spoke. The legality of Schiff\u2019s comments \u201cBut he made it sound so horrible. That\u2019s illegal. I mean, it \u2013 no way you can get away with that. That\u2019s a \u2013 but that\u2019s a total fraud.\u201d \u2013 October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s Eric Bolling Facts First: While it\u2019s fair for Trump to be miffed about Schiff\u2019s comments at a congressional committee meeting \u2013 Schiff\u2019s mix of near-quotes from Trump, his own analysis, and supposed \u201cparody\u201d was at the very least confusing \u2013 Schiff\u2019s words were not illegal. The Constitution includes a specific provision that allows members of Congress to speak freely during official meetings. The whistleblower\u2019s knowledge \u201cThe whistleblower had second- and third-hand information. You remember that, it was a big problem.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Some of the whistleblower\u2019s information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, noted that the whistleblower had \u201cdirect knowledge of certain alleged conduct.\u201d The whistleblower and quid pro quo \u201cAnd to think they took that call \u2013 now, the big thing I did with that call, Sean, the biggest thing is immediately released it because the whistleblower came out and said horrible things about this call. I think they said there were eight \u2013 seven or eight \u2013 quid pro quos. It was really a terrible call \u2013 you know, all these terrible things about this call.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: The whistleblower did not even use the words \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d much less specify a number of times Trump allegedly said them. People talking about Trump\u2019s Ukraine call \u201cThe \u2013 one of his (Zelensky\u2019s) top people \u2013 I guess, one of his heads of state came out and said this was a perfect call. There was no pressure. They didn\u2019t even know what we were talking about. To think that they\u2019re using that \u2013 now they don\u2019t talk about that anymore, because that letter was so good. So they don\u2019t talk about it anymore, Sean. And the reason they don\u2019t talk about it: there\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d And: \u201cHow can you take a President \u2013 now, again, they don\u2019t like to talk about the phone call because it was perfect.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: To the contrary, Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s President was the subject of widespread discussion among members of Congress and in the media at the time; it was a central focus of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower being \u201cgone\u201d \u201cYou never hear, what happened to the whistleblower? They\u2019re gone, because they\u2019ve been discredited.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers say they have firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow \u201cgone,\u201d let alone that they are \u201cgone\u201d because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate. \u201cThe whistleblowers have not vanished,\u201d Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter. The troops being withdrawn from Syria \u201cBut when I watch these pundits that always are trying to take a shot, I say \u2013 they say, \u2018What are we getting out of it?\u2019 You know what we\u2019re getting out of it? We\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home. That\u2019s a big thing.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Trump is not bringing the troops back home, at least not at the moment. Trump has announced that \u201cUnited States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq,\u201d then that some troops would remain in Syria to protect oil fields. He has also announced that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia. Trump conceded later in the Cabinet meeting that the soldiers will be \u201csent, initially, to different parts,\u201d but he claimed that they would \u201cultimately\u201d return to the US. The timeline in Syria \u201cWe won\u2019t be fighting, and we\u2019ll bring our soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days, and they\u2019ve been there now for 10 years, in Syria. Ten years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting \u201cWe want to bring soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days. They\u2019re there for 10 years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cWe were supposed to be there for 30 days; that was almost 10 years ago. So we\u2019re there for 30 days, and now we\u2019re leaving. It was supposed to be a very quick hit and let\u2019s get out.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech on the situation in Syria \u201cWe were supposed to be there for 30 days - That was 10 years ago.\u201d \u2013 October 25 tweet Facts First: There was never any specific timeline for the US military\u2019s involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. The US began bombing Syria in 2014 and deployed ground troops in 2015 \u2013 five years ago and four years ago, not 10 years ago. Military spending \u201cWe are building up America\u2019s military might like never before, investing $2.5 trillion since my election.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech on the situation in Syria Facts First: Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama\u2019s tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016. Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the \u201c$2.5 trillion\u201d figure \u2013 but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress. The deal with Turkey \u201cPeople have been trying to make this deal for years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting \u201cThis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else, no other nation. Very simple. And we\u2019re willing to take blame, and we\u2019re also willing to take credit. This is something they\u2019ve been trying to do for many, many decades.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech on the situation in Syria Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is baseless to the point of being nonsensical. The deal is a narrow agreement specifically tied to the Turkish offensive that followed Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held region of northern Syria, not an agreement that resolves longstanding regional disputes. Further, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush never sought to give Turkey anything like the concessionary terms of Trump\u2019s deal. You can read a longer fact check here. The Iraq War \u201cIf you remember, I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian, so I had no power over it. But I always was speaking against going into Iraq.\u201d  \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting. \u201cIf you read about the history of Donald Trump \u2013 I was a civilian. I had absolutely nothing to do with going into Iraq, and I was totally against it.\u201d And: \u201cIn Iraq \u2013 so they spent \u2013 President Bush went in. I strongly disagreed with it, even though it wasn\u2019t my expertise at the time, but I had a \u2013 I have a very good instinct about things.\u201d \u2013 October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Facts First: Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, \u201cAre you for invading Iraq?\u201d He responded: \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said, \u201cIt looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\u201d Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, \u201cEither you attack or don\u2019t attack.\u201d Trump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in 2014. You can read a longer fact check here. China and nuclear weapons \u201cRight now we have the most powerful nuclear force in the world. \u2026 And we are discussing with Russia, and we\u2019re discussing with China. During the recent trade deal with China, I said, \u2018We should all get together and work out something \u2013 a cap, have a cap. We don\u2019t need 10,000 weapons, have a cap.\u2019 And I will say China and Russia are talking about it. \u2026 I\u2019m very excited about it. \u2026 And I think Russia would like to make a deal, and I think China would like to make a deal. And I think that\u2019s a big \u2013 that would be a terrific thing. I\u2019d love to be a part of that.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: There is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cChina would like to make a deal\u201d that would limit its nuclear arsenal. While we can\u2019t know what Chinese officials might have said to Trump in private, China has publicly expressed vehement opposition to negotiating any limits with the US and Russia. After Trump previously suggested that China wanted to participate in a trilateral deal with the US and Russia, a spokesperson for the Chinese government said in May: \u201cWe oppose any country\u2019s attempt to make an issue out of China on arms control and will not participate in any negotiation for a trilateral nuclear disarmament agreement.\u201d In October, Bloomberg reported that Fu Cong, director general of the foreign ministry\u2019s Arms Control Department, had said, \u201cChina has no interest in participating in a nuclear-arms-reduction negotiation with the U.S. or Russia, given the huge gap between China\u2019s nuclear arsenal and those of the U.S. and Russia.\u201d Retired Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, told us this week: \u201cChina has developed an expansive overarching military strategy and they don\u2019t believe submitting to a potentially disadvantageous (for them) arms control regime is in China\u2019s best interest. While China did accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, it has never agreed to limits on its short- and intermediate-range missiles. As an ascendant power, China has no real incentive to limit its nuclear arsenal unless it determines that it doesn\u2019t need nuclear weapons to achieve its foreign policy goals.\u201d Ivanka Trump and jobs \u201cThrough our Pledge to American Workers, more than 360 companies have committed to providing over 14 million training jobs and career opportunities for the American worker. My daughter, Ivanka, worked so hard on that. That\u2019s her love. It\u2019s her passion. It\u2019s incredible. She came to me at the beginning of the administration, and she said, \u2018I want to help people get jobs, Dad. But they have to be trained.\u2019 She was a great student. She\u2019s a great person. And she said, \u2018But they have to be trained.\u2019 I said, \u2018What\u2019s your goal?\u2019 She said, \u2019500,000 jobs.\u2019 She just hit 14 million. Can you be \u2013 I said, \u2018That\u2019s Ivanka.\u2019 You know, that\u2019s Ivanka. Fourteen million jobs.\u201d \u2013 October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum Facts First: Given that fewer than 6.5 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency through September, Ivanka Trump, the President\u2019s daughter and White House adviser, was obviously not responsible for \u201c14 million jobs.\u201d As Trump alluded to in a slightly more accurate remark earlier in this paragraph, companies have promised to create more than 14 million \u201cnew opportunities\u201d for workers as of Wednesday \u2013 but many of these \u201copportunities\u201d are internal training opportunities, not new jobs. The web page for the pledge program describes them as \u201ceducation and training opportunities.\u201d Also, as CNN has previously reported, many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative. The Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana \u201cThink what that \u2013 I just left Louisiana recently. And we opened a $10 billion LNG plant. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen a longer building. It\u2019s like a skyscraper laid on its side. It is the most incredible thing you\u2019ve ever seen. More pipes in that building that \u2013 nobody realized how complex it is. But it took years and years, and it was a dead project. And I had it approved almost immediately.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: The permits for the Sempra Energy facility Trump visited in May were granted by the Obama administration. The company says on its website: \u201cThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized the project in June 2014.\u201d The company confirmed to FactCheck.org: \u201cYou are correct, Cameron LNG was approved in 2014.\u201d The facility made its first shipment in late May. Energy independence \u201cSince I came in we\u2019re now energy independent.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cWe\u2019re now energy independent. Who would\u2019ve thought that? That wasn\u2019t going to happen for a long time.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: While definitions of \u201cenergy independence\u201d vary, the US is not \u201cenergy independent\u201d by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government\u2019s Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted, the US also consumed more energy than it produced. There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn\u2019t happened for a full recent year. You can read a longer fact check here. The unemployment rate \u201cUnemployment is at the lowest rate in more than 51 years.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: This was one of Trump\u2019s signature little exaggerations. The September rate, 3.5%, was the lowest since December 1969, just under 50 years ago. Unemployment for women Trump said women have their lowest unemployment numbers in \u201c71 years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: This was another exaggeration. It has been 66 years since the women\u2019s rate has been as low as it was in September, 3.4%, not 71 years. Prescription drug prices \u201cAnd we had the first year ever where prices actually went down.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972, not the first one \u201cever.\u201d (As The Washington Post pointed out in its own fact check, some experts say the Consumer Price Index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn\u2019t include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers. The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that \u201cnet drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018.\u201d) China\u2019s economic performance \u201cChina is doing very poorly. Worst year they\u2019ve had in 57 years. I wonder why. I wonder why. I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d  \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting \u201cAll over the world \u2013 countries aren\u2019t doing well. China\u2019s not doing well. China\u2019s having the worst year they\u2019ve had in 57 years.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: China\u2019s second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992, 27 years ago. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason. China\u2019s agricultural purchases \u201cWell, one little example is the farmers. So they were told and I was told, if we could get $20 billion a year in purchase \u2013 the biggest they\u2019ve ever done is $16 (billion), is what I\u2019ve heard and what they\u2019ve said. If we could get $20 billion a year from China \u2013 that China purchases $20 billion a year of agricultural product \u2013 that would be a great thing.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture. Who is paying for the tariffs on China \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing great. We\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China, and they\u2019re eating the tariffs because they devalued their currency.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting \u201cDon\u2019t forget China\u2019s paying us tens of billions of dollars in tariffs, and it\u2019s had a huge impact on China. And it hasn\u2019t cost us anything because they devalued their currency or they\u2019ve poured money in. It hasn\u2019t cost us \u2013 they\u2019ve eaten that. They\u2019ve eaten it totally.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity Facts First: A bevy of economic studies have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments. The USMCA and Canada \u201cWe need \u2013 for our farmers, our manufacturers, for, frankly, unions and non-unions, we need USMCA to be voted on. If it\u2019s voted on, it\u2019ll pass. It\u2019s up to Nancy Pelosi to put it up. \u2026 Mexico and Canada have approved it; it\u2019s done. They\u2019re waiting for our approval. And we can\u2019t seem to get the votes.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting \u201c\u2026and all the things we\u2019ve done, and we have to get USMCA done, and they don\u2019t want to put it up for a vote. And the Do-Nothing Democrats, they will pass it, but it has to be put up Nancy Pelosi. \u2026 It\u2019s approved by Mexico. It\u2019s approved by Canada. It\u2019s approved by everybody that has to be approved. We have to give it a vote. It\u2019s been sitting for a long time.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: Mexico\u2019s Senate has voted to approve the USMCA trade agreement, but Canada\u2019s Parliament has not. (The agreement is highly unlikely to be rejected by Parliament, but still, the voting has not happened yet.) The crowd in Dallas, part 1 \u201cI was in Dallas the other night, we set a record in a stadium \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s got to be an arena that\u2019s got to be 20 years old \u2026 we have a record.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cI go to these massive basketball arenas, like in Dallas, where the Mavericks play, and fill it up and set a record.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Trump did not break the attendance record at the American Airlines Center. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN data. The crowd in Dallas, part 2 Trump said of his rally the previous week in Dallas: \u201cI had 25,000 people, close, in that arena.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Again, the Dalas Fire-Rescue Department put the number at 18,500. Trump said of the Dallas rally: \u201cAnd we had 20,000 people outside, at least.\u201d \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: Trump\u2019s estimate was way off, though it was lower than the \u201cclose to 30,000\u201d he had claimed during the speech. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,\u201d Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in response to that previous Trump estimate. Rally crowds in general \u201cI haven\u2019t had an empty seat at a rally.\u201d \u2013 October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a rally earlier this month in Minneapolis, a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene. \u201cI love the Republicans. Ninety-four and 95% approval rating they gave me recently.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First: Trump\u2019s approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find. Trump was at 90% with Republicans in a CNN poll conducted from October 17-20, 83% with Republicans in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 17-21, 81% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted October 18-22. \u201cLook at North Carolina. Great state. Great people. Two races that were going to be lost, I went in, made a speech, let everybody know I really respect these two guys and they\u2019re going to be great, they both won. They both won by good margins.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cYou saw what happened in North Carolina: We picked up two seats that people didn\u2019t think we were going to pick up. That was two weeks ago.\u201d  \u2013 October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First: The special elections in North Carolina were six weeks ago, not two weeks ago. While the race in the 9th District was considered competitive, the race in the 3rd District was expected by pollsters and analysts to be won easily by the Republican candidate. Both seats had previously been held by Republicans, so the party did not pick them up. (Trump might have just been speaking informally.) \u201cLook, I think that the Democrats are not good politicians. I think they have lousy policy. They have policy of open borders and sanctuary cities and crime.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cTheir policies are horrible: open borders, sanctuary cities, take everyone\u2019s guns away.\u201d \u2013 October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference \u201cLOUISIANA! Extreme Democrat John Bel Edwards has sided with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to support Sanctuary Cities, High Taxes, and Open Borders.\u201d \u2013 October 26 tweet Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests. \u201cThe Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong.\u201d \u2013 October 26 tweet. Facts First: There is simply no evidence that the Post fabricated its sources for this article. Trump is entitled to argue that the sources aren\u2019t correct, but there is no basis for the claim that the sources don\u2019t exist. The article began: \u201cAfter weeks of dismissing the impeachment inquiry as a hollow partisan attack, President Trump and his closest advisers now recognize that the snowballing probe poses a serious threat to the president \u2013 and that they have little power to block it, according to multiple aides and advisers.\u201d \u201cIt ended with a very poor performance (by Robert Mueller, testifying to Congress). And this is after more than two years of an investigation where they spent $45 million or something like that.\u201d \u2013 October 21 interview with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cI fought off the Mueller hoax. I fought off all of them, and it continues. It\u2019s just crazy. This has never happened to a president before, and they spend $45 million. \u2026 I could find something on you for $45 million, and you\u2019re perfect.\u201d \u2013 October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group\u2019s Eric Bolling \u201cThis is a hoax \u2013 just like there was no collusion. After two years, they found out and wasted $45 million. This is a disgrace that this could happen in our country.\u201d \u2013 October 25 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure \u201cSpent $45 million, and they found nothing.\u201d \u2013 October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum Facts First: The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $45 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department, and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller. The vast majority of this $17 million is expected to come from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was ordered to forfeit assets and pay millions to the Internal Revenue Service.

            "article_content": "Faced with a barrage of damaging headlines for President Donald Trump stemming from impeachment inquiry testimony, congressional Republicans are beginning to coalesce around a strategy aimed at discrediting key witnesses and taking a more confrontational stance against the Democratic-led impeachment process. Republicans on Thursday ramped up their skepticism of the testimony delivered by US diplomat Bill Taylor \u2014 which undercut White House claims Ukraine aid wasn\u2019t tied to an investigation that could help him politically \u2014 and the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican Sen. John Thune walked back earlier concerns he expressed about Taylor\u2019s opening statement. Republicans in the Senate have also shown little interest in investigating the frozen Ukraine aid, with two committee chairmen signaling that\u2019s not a priority right now. Congressional Republican lawmakers and aides say they are taking the reins to defend the President in the impeachment inquiry amid mounting fears that the White House is not consistent nor organized enough to lead the President\u2019s defense. But their efforts come as the President publicly and privately is pushing congressional Republicans to toughen up their defense of him as the Democratic impeachment process marches forward. And the strategy congressional Republicans have formulated was on display this week when Republicans launched a political stunt to disrupt Wednesday\u2019s deposition, launching a five-hour delay that gave their protest of the closed-door process broad media coverage even as some Republicans broke House rules themselves by bringing electronics into the secure facilities. The effort was a success in the eyes of the President. For any national security professional, GOP stunt is a serious breach \u201cThank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History,\u201d Trump tweeted. It has also, to a large degree, been a success with their members, a pulse leadership continues to check in on as they gauge how the conference is reacting to the seemingly daily drip of revelations, the aides said. \u201cTell me who besides Rooney has shown cracks publicly,\u201d one GOP lawmaker told CNN, referencing retiring Florida Republican Rep. Francis Rooney, who has voiced concerns about the Ukraine revelations. \u201cThe answer is nobody. Even our moderates are upset about the process \u2013 and even our moderates are hearing from back in the district that the process argument resonates with our people.\u201d Senate Republicans are getting into the complain-about-the-process act, too, with Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introducing a resolution Thursday to condemn the Democratic impeachment inquiry. Graham said at a news conference Thursday on the resolution that White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged the White House needs help with impeachment messaging. \u201cI met with Mick Mulvaney. He said, \u2018Keep talking to us. We\u2019re getting there,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cYes, the message has been received and they\u2019re making corrective action but he actually mentioned that.\u201d While Republicans have decried the Democrats\u2019 closed-door depositions in the first phase of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 criticizing the testimony that\u2019s leaked out as misleading and lacking context \u2014 Democrats are planning a round of public hearings when they complete their depositions that will put pressure on GOP process-focused strategy. Those hearings could happen as early as next month, though the timing remains fluid as the committees identify more witnesses they want to speak to behind closed doors, so they also might not occur until after Thanksgiving, according to sources. It\u2019s something senior GOP aides are aware of \u2013 and behind the scenes have begun to craft a strategy to confront the next phase of the Democratic effort, aides tell CNN. \u201cWe know the process argument has a shelf life,\u201d one GOP aide said. Recognizing they will have to battle Democrats over the testimony of witnesses like Taylor, Republicans have set their sights on undercutting witnesses who could be damaging to the President. Francis Rooney is the rare House Republican open to impeaching Trump Taylor\u2019s opening statement stated that he was told by US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that Trump was conditioning the release of US security aid to Ukraine and a one-on-one meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Zelensky stating publicly that Ukraine would investigation the 2016 election and Burisma, the company that hired Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Reporters have pressed Republicans on the testimony, and many in the House and Senate have responded by arguing that Taylor\u2019s testimony is \u201chearsay\u201d or secondhand information \u2014 a similar complaint that the President and his allies launched against the original whistleblower complaint. \u201cHow would you really know? \u2026 It was his testimony, but all second and some third-hand, I understand,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican. \u201cWhen you watch a trial and you want to get a fair assessment of guilt and innocence, you don\u2019t just listen to the opening statements,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. \u201cYou listen to the witnesses and the examination and the cross examination. You don\u2019t just take pieces of the trial and take them out of context.\u201d Even GOP senators who initially raised concerns about Taylor\u2019s testimony were focused on the source of his information on Thursday. Thune, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, said Tuesday that \u201cthe picture coming out of it, based on the reporting that we\u2019ve seen, I would say is not a good one.\u201d But on Thursday, Thune argued \u201cwe are hearing one side of the story.\u201d \u201cFrom what I could tell, a lot of the interactions and statements had been based on second-hand information and those are obviously points that can be disputed, but I think until the administration has an opportunity to put on their response and answer some of those questions. \u2026 I think we all sit and wait until the full body of this comes out,\u201d Thune said. While the House\u2019s investigation into the freezing of Ukraine aid is moving full-speed ahead, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a similar effort underway in the Senate. Asked if he would hold hearings on why the aid was withheld, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch told CNN, \u201cThat\u2019s been assigned to the Intelligence Committee.\u201d He declined to comment further. But Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said his committee is not focused on the aid being frozen, only the whistleblower complaint. \u201cI\u2019m trying to unpack the whistleblower process,\u201d Burr said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m only telling you what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d Republican congressional aides say the work on impeachment has become a round-the-clock endeavor, with aides working to ensure that the party has a cohesive message regardless of the President\u2019s evolving Twitter defense. Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, holds a weekly impeachment meeting, and there are regular, if ad hoc, contacts to gauge the temperature and any concerns from members during House floor votes and at conference meetings. That was a particularly important factor in the wake of Mulvaney\u2019s widely panned press conference last week, where he openly acknowledged a political quid pro quo before walking it back later in a statement. Several members made clear to leadership that they were, in the words on one GOP lawmaker: \u201crips\u2014\u201d about what had transpired. But leadership worked throughout the day to calm the waters. Internally, Republican lawyers for the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs are meeting regularly with counsel for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, aides say, and communication directors for the relevant committees are talking daily with leadership about how to tailor the message. They are providing their members with three main talking points, including an attack on the closed-door process and leaks, criticizing House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff personally and arguing that the allegations against Trump don\u2019t rise to the level of an impeachable offense. A Republican leadership aide told CNN that the inconsistency in the White House\u2019s message has been difficult to navigate around, thanks to the unpredictability of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed and comments to reporters with a new defense of his \u201cperfect\u201d call with Zelensky. \u201cLast week was not a good week,\u201d the aide said, noting that the Clinton White House worked hard to provide air cover for all Democrats to be able to stick with the President. \u201cI wish they would adopt a very consistent, well-thought out message that talks about one message and follow that theme all the way through. They just jump around day to day,\u201d said one GOP aide. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of whatever he tweets out in the morning, that is what they run with.\u201d Senate Republicans worked through their own baseline of four talking points in a closed-door lunch on Tuesday, with senators proceeding to pick their preferred message to deploy on their own, senators in the room told CNN. But the White House message, or lack of one, has also unsettled Republicans in that chamber, senators acknowledged. Asked Wednesday if the White House could do a better job of messaging on impeachment, Graham, a staunch ally of the Pesident, said flatly: \u201cYes.\u201d Another senator, asked about what the White House strategy has been up to this point, started to chuckle. \u201cA one-man Twitter war room apparently,\u201d the senator said. \u201cNot sure that\u2019s the answer.\u201d",

Francis Rooney said Saturday he would not run for reelection, after suggesting he could be open to impeaching President Donald Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve done what I came to do,\u201d Rooney told Fox News. He said he ran for Congress to \u201cget the money for the Everglades projects that had been languishing for many years, and to try to get this offshore drilling ban passed to protect Florida.\u201d Rooney, who won his first election in 2016, said he initially thought his goals would take three terms, \u201cbut I think I\u2019ve done it in less than two.\u201d Francis Rooney is the rare House Republican open to impeaching Trump Asked by Fox News if he needed or wanted to pursue a third term in office, Rooney said, \u201cI don\u2019t really think I do, and I don\u2019t really think I want one.\u201d The congressman said he wanted to be a \u201cmodel for term limits,\u201d and added: \u201cPeople need to realize \u2026 this is public service not public life.\u201d Rooney \u2013 a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Trump \u2013 said Friday he had not yet come to a conclusion on whether the President committed a crime that compels his removal from office.

            "article_content": "When Gordon Sondland arrived in Brussels as the US ambassador to the European Union in July 2018, it didn\u2019t take long before people were reminded of his American boss. The hotel executive struck many of his European counterparts as something of a mini-Donald Trump. He started renovating the US embassy. He freely gave interviews and was a fixture on Twitter. He threw lavish parties and boasted of his growing relationship with Trump. In the corridors of the European Parliament, Sondland worked to build personal relationships with heads of state and diplomats. Though he knew it was a breach of protocol, Sondland\u2019s habit of calling officials by their first name was an attempt to build a personal rapport, but also struck some as off-putting in the rule-bound capital of the European Union. So did his penchant for speaking bluntly. One veteran diplomat tells CNN that Sondland would ridicule the EU for being obsessed with regulations. \u201cAt the same time, he was open and candid \u2013 just not a believer in the traditional values that have kept Europe and the US so close in the last 70 years.\u201d In discussing trade, Sondland would complain that the EU was \u201cripping off\u201d the US, said Jeremy Shapiro, a research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations, who interacted with Sondland. Shapiro says that Sondland would also threaten his European counterparts with a \u201cChinese-style stand-off\u201d if they didn\u2019t cooperate on trade. \u201cWhen he speaks he\u2019s forceful, blunt and un-diplomatic and it aggravates people,\u201d said Shapiro. Sondland is now a key player in an impeachment inquiry examining whether the President tried to use US military aid as leverage in his effort to get a foreign country to investigate a political foe. On Thursday, Sondland, who remains in his post as ambassador, will testify behind closed doors to the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees that are leading the Democratic impeachment inquiry into Trump and Ukraine. Their investigation was spurred by a whistleblower complaint alleging Trump sought help from Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings. Sondland is a crucial witness for Democrats\u2019 impeachment case. Lawmakers have already interviewed multiple current and former State Department officials, and Sondland has popped up in their testimony in several instances, including text messages turned over to Congress in which Sondland and a top US diplomat in Ukraine debate whether $400 million in military and security aid was being withheld in connection with Ukraine opening an investigation. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor texted to Sondland on September 9. Taylor is expected to testify before the committees on Tuesday. A self-made hotelier from Portland, Oregon, Sondland was for years the Republican Party\u2019s go-to bundler in the Pacific Northwest. After donating to the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney in 2012, Sondland had initially supported Jeb Bush and then Marco Rubio in their 2016 presidential campaigns. The irony of his current predicament is that he was not welcome in Trump World and had to force his way in, according to multiple former White House officials. According to two Trump campaign advisers, Sondland angered Trump when he denied his campaign the use of his hotels as fundraiser venues after Trump\u2019s negative remarks about the family of a slain Muslim-American soldier in the summer of 2016. One of Sondland\u2019s business partners is Muslim. But after Trump won, Sondland found himself on the outside looking in. \u201cGordon was desperate to win the approval of Trump,\u201d said one of his long-time Republican friends who worked in the White House. To earn Trump\u2019s favor, Sondland ended up donating $1 million to the inauguration. Sondland\u2019s change of heart did not surprise people who know him. David Nierenberg, a wealthy investor and friend of Sondland, told CNN that Sondland always aspired to connect himself to people of power. \u201cPeople like me collect books and wine and Gordon collects relationships with people in power,\u201d said Nierenberg, adding that a glimpse of Sondland\u2019s personal office offers a telling window into his ambition. Lining the room are photos of Sondland alongside well-known politicians, including Romney, and both Presidents Bush. What\u2019s striking, says Nierenberg, is that pictures of Sondland with politicians outnumber those of his own family. \u201cYou can see his ambition in the photographs.\u201d After his inauguration donation, Sondland\u2019s name was suddenly on a list that former White House adviser responsible for personnel, Johnny DeStefano, regularly put in front of the President, says a person with knowledge. Still, it took Trump months to come around to the idea of nominating Sondland. One Senate aide remembers that given all the other Trump nominees deemed unfit by many Democrats, Sonland seemed harmless. \u201cHe blended in the background,\u201d the aide said. \u201cWhat is maybe most remarkable in retrospect is how unremarkable his nomination seemed at the time,\u201d said another Congressional source familiar with Sondland\u2019s confirmation. \u201cHe was very obviously a donor pick and not someone with much prior foreign policy experience, but other than that, our records and our staff\u2019s recollections of it are that there wasn\u2019t much else that stood out during his confirmation process. I definitely don\u2019t think at that time that anyone guessed he would have ended up in the middle of a fiasco like this.\u201d Once confirmed, Sondland was viewed as a problem by the national security teams at the White House and at the State Department, two administration officials told CNN. Sondland did not feel bound by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo or national security adviser John Bolton. He could call the President whenever he wanted, and did, they said. Bolton\u2019s spokesperson declined to comment. A State Department spokesperson also declined to comment. \u201cOnce he was an ambassador he was going to put himself in the middle of things, that\u2019s who he is,\u201d says a Republican political consultant. Sondland would reach out to Bolton at times to try to set up meetings, but Bolton would often refuse to meet him, one of the administration officials explained. That same official told CNN that Sondland would often confuse other countries that dealt with him, because he blurred the lines of who was in charge of administration policy. Sometimes the White House or State Department would ignore his initiatives because they were not always consistent with policy, the official said. Ukraine is not usually in the portfolio of the EU embassy, but Sondland may claim it was always in his briefing book, according to a source familiar with what he is likely to testify. In her testimony to Congress this week, Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser, said that she regarded Sondland as a security risk, a source familiar with her testimony tells CNN. Hill told Congress that Sondland frequently used his personal cell phone to conduct official diplomatic business, and that she worried his lack of experience could be exploited by foreign governments. Sondland is still expecting to show up on Thursday and speak to impeachment investigators, according to a person familiar with the EU ambassador\u2019s preparations. Sondland\u2019s legal team has publicly pointed to the State Department regarding any document requests, saying State would be the entity to turn any discussions of official business over to the Hill. Sondland hasn\u2019t heard from the White House or State Department with requests to block all or parts of his testimony Thursday, the person said. Last week, the State Department stopped Sondland from speaking to Hill investigators, prompting them to subpoena him. Hill\u2019s legal team had refused to honor a request from the White House to consider some of her communications privileged. Sondland, the source said, is pushing back on the idea that the White House\u2019s national security advisers expressed alarm about a possible quid pro quo with Ukraine, saying that Hill and Bolton never made it known to Sondland that they were concerned. Even emails between Sondland and Hill, Trump\u2019s former Russia specialist, were \u201ccordial\u201d and \u201ccollegial,\u201d with the ambassador keeping her updated on his activities in Ukraine, the person said. Sondland contends that he never understood that the President sought an investigation of Joe Biden, according to the source, even when Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was pushing for a Ukrainian investigation of the natural gas company Burisma and into foreign interference in the 2016 election. Sondland contends he did not understand that Trump sought political help from Ukraine at least until after the July 25 call transcript was released, where Trump had brought up Biden, according to the source. On impeachment, Democrats crack down on White House stonewalling strategy The source also contends Sondland\u2019s interactions with Giuliani were far less than others perceived, though necessary to achieve progress with Ukraine. \u201cIf you wanted to get this meeting with (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky, then you could either abandon that or you could work through Rudy (Giuliani),\u201d the person said, again describing what Sondland may say on Thursday. \u201cThey came to understand that what Rudy wanted was a public statement by Zelensky to look at Burisma and the server in 2016.\u201d Some of Sondland\u2019s friends worry about his potential exposure. \u201cI hope that he did not cross any lines that he might now regret,\u201d said Jordan Schnitzer a real estate developer in Portland, Oregon, and a longtime friend of Sondland. Sondland\u2019s friend David Nierenberg told CNN that he had emailed Sondland as the Ukraine scandal was breaking, reminding him that Richard Nixon did not lose the presidency because of the break-in at Democratic National Committee, but rather because of two years of lies and cover-ups. \u201cI concluded my message, therefore, by saying whatever you do, tell the truth, if there\u2019s anything that you regret doing or not doing on reflection that admitted, freely, apologize for it and make things right because you have the rest of your life ahead of you.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Sondland replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve always given me good advice.\u201d The story has been updated to clarify what Sondland understood the President sought from Ukraine before he saw the transcript of the call with Zelensky. CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger, Tim Lister, James Frater and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Ukraine call wasn\u2019t a bug of this administration. It was a feature. President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate debunked allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden were part of a pattern of behavior. As CNN reported Thursday night: \u201cDuring a phone call with [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] on June 18, Trump raised Biden\u2019s political prospects as well as those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who by then had started rising in the polls, according to two people familiar with the discussion. In that call, Trump also told Xi he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! That call was then put into a special, secure electronic system \u2013 the same one where the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky was placed. So, within five weeks this summer, we have Trump on the phone with a foreign leader discussing, at a minimum, his potential 2020 opponents. And at least in the Ukraine call, making clear that he wanted a \u201cfavor\u201d for all of the things the US was doing \u2013 and could do \u2013 for the country. All of which means that, almost certainly, these are not the only two calls of this sort that Trump has placed. If Trump is willing to talk about Biden and Warren with the Chinese \u2013 not exactly an ally \u2013 or to float an unspoken quid pro quo with Ukraine, who would he not be willing to talk to or use American power as a lever against? The answer is, of course, no one. Don\u2019t believe me? Just listen to Trump. \u201cWell I would think that if they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Trump said of the Ukrainians on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens.\u201d He added: \u201cLikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine. So, I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d He said the quiet part out loud! Why? Because Trump sees nothing wrong with using his perch as the President of the United States to strong-arm world leaders into doing his political bidding. He\u2019s President! He can do what he wants! And who is pro-corruption anyway? \u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!,\u201d tweeted Trump Thursday night. He later added this on top of that tweet: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about a Campaign, this is about Corruption on a massive scale!\u201d (Irony alert\u2026) On Friday morning, Trump was at it again. \u201cAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!\u201d What Trump doesn\u2019t get \u2013 or chooses not to get \u2013 is that there\u2019s a big difference between rooting out corruption and using (and abusing) the power of America to pressure foreign countries to dig dirt on your two main political opponents in the 2020 election. Especially when, in the case of Biden and Ukraine, there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. That fundamental misunderstanding of how a president should \u2013 and should not \u2013 use the power of his office is the only explanation for why Trump would release the rough transcript of his call with Zelensky, which, if not a smoking gun, is pretty close. This sort of behavior isn\u2019t aberrant to, or for, Trump. In fact, it\u2019s entirely consistent with who he has been his whole life \u2013 always looking for leverage to be used to personal advantage. Being elected president didn\u2019t change that worldview. It just gave Trump more power to play with. Add it all up and you get this: There will very likely be more calls and conversations like the ones we\u2019ve learned about of late between Trump and foreign leaders. This is who Trump is. This is what he does.",

            "article_content": "As Elizabeth Warren\u2019s candidacy for president caught fire this summer, so did images of her seemingly endless energy: running on to the stage at campaign events; punching the air when she speaks; working the photo line for hours after rallies. In the evenings, Warren keeps moving, often doing laps around the hotel grounds or pacing in the lobby. But she does it with a different kind of intensity \u2013 this is when she is starting to unwind, talking on the phone with her husband, Bruce Mann. A professor at Harvard Law School specializing in legal history and property law, Mann is unquestionably the quieter half of the couple. Friends, colleagues and campaign aides say Mann has never been one to seek the public spotlight. But as Warren climbs in the polls, there may be no escaping it. On a recent Friday morning, Mann and Bailey, the couple\u2019s rambunctious 16-month-old golden retriever, answered the side door of their Cambridge home, letting CNN reporters inside for the couple\u2019s first joint interview of the campaign. Mann\u2019s left hand was in a hard cast \u2013 he had recently broken a bone while trying to break up a fight between Bailey and a neighbor\u2019s dog. (\u201cBailey got jumped, let\u2019s be clear,\u201d Warren would later insist \u2013 she\u2019s never known Mann to get caught up in a scuffle. \u201cBruce went to Bailey\u2019s rescue.\u201d) Asked about the couple\u2019s contrasting personalities, Mann, 69, responded with a smile: \u201cIt just works.\u201d Seated next to her husband of almost 40 years in a white wicker chair in their back sunroom, Warren chimed in in agreement. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be married to somebody like me. I want to be married to somebody like him.\u201d If Warren is elected, Mann would play an unprecedented role as the first male presidential spouse. That role once seemed likely to go to Bill Clinton, a man thoroughly accustomed to the political stage. Mann would be a very different kind of first husband \u2013 a longtime observer of politics, but far from a politician himself. A little more than four months out from the Iowa caucuses, Mann said he has not been closely involved in the ins and outs of the Warren campaign, and remains a mystery to most voters. But those close to the couple say that Mann\u2019s influence on his wife\u2019s candidacy is not to be underestimated \u2013 he has a unique ability to help his famously energetic wife decompress after long days of travel and campaigning, they said. \u201cHe brings a sense of calm to her more than anyone else could,\u201d said Nora Keefe, Warren\u2019s bodywoman. \u201cWhen you see the images of Elizabeth up in front of a crowd, waving her hands, just being part of the crowd, I can\u2019t quite imagine Bruce up there waving his hands,\u201d said Drew Faust, the former president of Harvard University who has been friends with the couple for years. \u201cThere\u2019s this enormous warmth between them. And he is obviously \u2013 they are both obviously devoted to one another and take pride in their differences.\u201d Warren noted that much of her life over the last year has been \u201cdifferent motel rooms every night, hotel rooms every night, different food, different people around, but I always know the last person I\u2019ll have a good conversation with, the last person I\u2019ll talk to before I go to sleep, is you.\u201d Of those late-night phone calls, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s like letting all the pieces go.\u201d That morning was looking like it could shape up to be what Warren describes as a \u201creally good day\u201d: when she is home long enough to fit in two walks around Fresh Pond with Bailey and Mann, once early in the morning and again at night. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing better than a golden retriever puppy to create the illusion of normalcy,\u201d Mann joked. In two wide-ranging interviews \u2013 first with Mann and, later, the couple speaking together \u2013 they discussed what has been anything but a normal year. They couldn\u2019t pinpoint one moment when it became clear that Warren would run for president, something she had decided against doing four years ago. In the months leading up to the 2019 New Year, Warren had begun to quietly consult people whose advice she trusted, asking each of them for three reasons she shouldn\u2019t run, and three reasons she should. \u201cShe saved me for last, and finally, she asked me for three reasons, pro and con. And I said, no, I\u2019m not going to do it,\u201d Mann recalled. \u201cI said, you\u2019re gonna run anyways. So just doesn\u2019t matter. Because if you don\u2019t run and Democrats lose, you\u2019ll feel guilty because then that means there\u2019d be no one to fight for the people and the issues that you care about.\u201d He was right. Warren would announce her exploratory campaign on New Year\u2019s Eve. A registered Democrat and a self-described \u201cpolitical junkie\u201d and \u201ccompulsive reader of newspapers,\u201d Mann said he has been exercising discipline to avoid being consumed by news about his wife\u2019s campaign. He is sparing in what he flags to Warren, who has said she doesn\u2019t follow the news about the election closely. Warren has also taken a similar approach to polling, repeatedly declining to engage questions from reporters about who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down. At one point in the joint interview, when Mann was asked why he believes his wife has been leading in recent polls, Warren leaned into her husband with a reminder: \u201cAnd you remember, we don\u2019t do polls.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, we do not do polls,\u201d Mann said. But he offered up a theory on what has been attracting voters to his wife this year. \u201cShe\u2019s always had just an extraordinary ability to explain complex issues, clearly, memorably,\u201d he said. \u201cWatching people who hear her respond to her as she reaches them, as she helps them see how the issues touch their lives \u2013 it\u2019s, I\u2019m watching her teach on a larger stage.\u201d The couple\u2019s first meeting in the summer of 1979 was, as Mann describes, \u201cimprobable.\u201d He and Warren were both 29 and new to teaching, and had traveled to Key Biscayne, Florida, to attend an economics and law conference. He spotted Warren, who had recently separated from her first husband, Jim Warren, across the lawn at an opening reception. \u201cEven from that distance, I was just drawn to her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was so just lively, so animated, so engaged. And I just fell for her from 25 yards out before even meeting her.\u201d Admittedly, it wasn\u2019t quite love at first sight for Warren. \u201cThat was a Sunday, late afternoon,\u201d she mused of their first meeting. \u201cI wasn\u2019t completely in love with him until sometime mid-morning on Monday.\u201d What sealed the deal for Warren: \u201cIt was on Monday when I actually saw him in shorts. And good-looking legs. That\u2019s when I was all in.\u201d \u201cShe completely objectified me,\u201d Mann responded with a grin. If there was an immediate physical attraction, the pair also bonded over their similar upbringings. Warren was born in Oklahoma City, the baby of four. As she has told voters on the campaign trail this year, Warren vividly remembers watching her mother walk out of the house one day to look for a job after her father suffered a heart attack. Mann\u2019s parents didn\u2019t have much money, either. \u201cThey stretched and stretched and mortgaged to the hilt to buy the cheapest house in the town with one of the best public school systems,\u201d he said. Within months of their first meeting in Florida, Warren visited Mann at the University of Connecticut, where he was teaching at the time. She sat in on one of his classes, and after all of the students had left, Mann recalled asking her: \u201cWhat\u2019d you think?\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd she just said, \u2018What can I say? Will you marry me?\u2019 And I said, \u2018OK.\u2019 That is a direct quote, I remember every word.\u201d The couple juggled living in different cities long after they were married. Warren would continue teaching in Texas, before eventually getting hired at the University of Pennsylvania, where Mann also taught for almost 20 years. But when Warren landed a full-time teaching position at Harvard University in the 1990s, it would be years before Mann would also get a professorship at the school. They leaned on Warren\u2019s aunt, \u201cAunt Bee,\u201d to help raise Warren\u2019s two children from her first marriage, Amelia and Alex. In campaign speeches, Warren credits her aunt, after whom she is named, for changing the course of her life. She credits Aunt Bee, who lived with the family for 16 years, for having allowed her to continue teaching. \u201cOh, she\u2019d be so proud. She loved Elizabeth dearly,\u201d Mann said of Aunt Bee, who died in 1999. If she were still alive and observing Warren\u2019s 2020 campaign, Mann said, \u201cHer first response would probably be: \u2018How can I help?\u2019\u201d Something else that seemed improbable to Mann in 1979 was that politics would be in the couple\u2019s future. Warren was a Republican when they first met. She wouldn\u2019t change her party registration to Democrat until 1996. \u201cHowever conservative she might\u2019ve been at the time, it was not particularly apparent and we really didn\u2019t discuss politics,\u201d Mann said. But by 2011, Warren had made a name for herself in Washington, overseeing the Trouble Assets Relief Program after the financial crisis and conceiving of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama. That September, she mounted her first political campaign against Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown. It was during this closely watched Senate race that Warren first came under fire for her past claims to Native American heritage. She would defeat Brown, handing the Democrats a major pick-up in the Senate, but the criticism of how Warren handled her family history lingered. Her campaign\u2019s decision last year to release the results of a DNA test, which showed distant Native American ancestry, was widely panned. For Mann, who was close to Warren\u2019s extended family in Oklahoma, these criticisms were particularly painful. \u201cI knew everyone in her family, loved her family, knew all the stories that they had grown up with,\u201d Mann said. \u201cBecause it was an attack on her family, it was one that was sort of probably the least pleasant of the attacks she\u2019s endured.\u201d As for the possibility that Warren would be up against Trump if she were to win the Democratic nomination, Mann was matter of fact. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if anyone \u2013 how anyone trains for it,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean for all of this, you just jump into the deep end and you swim.\u201d The couple also insisted that they do not talk about what life could be like at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit early for that,\u201d Mann said. In the classroom, Mann said he never mentions his wife\u2019s name or the campaign, a boundary that his students have been respectful of. \u201cThey observe that separation. It\u2019s probably killing them, but they\u2019re very good,\u201d he said. Mann has not done any interviews this year, with the exception of a brief encounter with reporters outside of their Cambridge home on New Year\u2019s Eve, hours after Warren announced her exploratory campaign. Prompted for a comment, Mann had said that day: \u201cWe\u2019ve been married a long time and it\u2019s always been an adventure. So this is just another one.\u201d Asked how that adventure was going, Mann told CNN: \u201cExtraordinarily well.\u201d \u201cCertainly back then, I had no idea what it would look like \u2013 only that we would do it,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery part of it remains an adventure. So I stand by that statement.\u201d",

            "article_content": "After a whiplash week, America is facing the reality of a new long national nightmare over a potentially corrupt presidency. Forty-five years after Watergate, 20 years after Bill Clinton\u2019s shame, the mechanism of impeachment is again grinding into life in Washington. The attempt by Democrats to oust a defiant President Donald Trump seems likely, given already bitter divides, to pour even more poison into the nation\u2019s political soul than those previous two impeachment dramas. Unlike the complicated and confusing picture of shady dealings with Russians and potential obstruction painted by special counsel Robert Mueller, the questions pending in the new showdown are clear cut \u2013 a factor that adds to the President\u2019s political vulnerability. Did Trump abuse his power by leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer military aid to pressure a foreign country to damage a political opponent? And did the White House then engage in an effort to cover it up? \u201cThe President of the United States has betrayed his oath of office, betrayed his oath to defend our national security, and betrayed his oath to defend our constitution,\u201d House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Thursday. Acting spy chief tells Congress the 'whistleblower did the right thing' The whistleblower complaint against Trump regarding his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is a \u201croadmap,\u201d Schiff said. The document\u2019s accusations of a cover-up opens up several key Trump allies to interrogation, such as lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, and it alludes to possible other instances where records were kept secret for political purposes. Already, 219 House Democrats \u2013 more than half of the 435 members \u2013 have publicly stated support for impeachment proceedings, according to CNN\u2019s count.  The character of the Republican defense of the President is clear as well. GOP lawmakers and supporters are already seeking to discredit what appears to be strong documentary evidence of pressure by Trump on Zelensky. And the White House frames impeachment as another gross attack by Democrats on Trump, a President who they say viewed as illegitimate ever since his 2016 victory. \u201cWhat these guys are doing, Democrats are doing to this country is a disgrace, and it shouldn\u2019t be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it,\u201d Trump said, of the constitutional process of checks and balances, in a fiery statement on the airport tarmac after returning from New York on Thursday. On Monday, Washington showed up to work expecting most of the week\u2019s drama to unfold around Trump at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Yet, seemingly in the blink of an eye, life changed profoundly for the President, a Democratic House majority and Senate Republicans who could save the commander in chief. In the weeks ahead, the story of what went on in Trump\u2019s conversations with his Ukrainian counterpart and whether he broke the law and flouted the most basic constitutional principles will be distorted in a political maelstrom. But after a week of leaks, standoffs between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, blockbuster revelations and gambles by key power brokers, the facts of the case are beginning to emerge. Hillary Clinton says 'corrupt human tornado' Trump won't win reelection Trump stands accused of illicitly using $400 million in military aid, to coerce vulnerable Ukraine, which is fighting for its life against Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, into investigating his potential 2020 foe Joe Biden. The President seemed to think he could clear himself on Wednesday by releasing a rough transcript of a call with Zelensky. But his move made everything worse. Though Republicans insisted there was no quid pro quo, the document did show Trump leaning on Zelensky and asking for a \u201cfavor.\u201d In 2016, Trump was accused of knowingly profiting from a Russian election meddling scheme. If the latest accusations are borne out, he took 2020 election interference into his own hands. The case darkened considerably with Thursday\u2019s release of a whistleblower report that the White House had sought to suppress in order to contain the worst crisis of his presidency. The still-unknown person who wrote the report accused the President of \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election.\u201d If such activity did take place, it would be about as close to a charge of presidential abuse of power \u2013 a potentially impeachable offense \u2013 as it is possible to get. In another detail that will have far reaching implications, the whistleblower alleged that the White House tried to cover up the evidence of Trump\u2019s behavior. The report said that officials were told to take the transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky from the computer system in which it was stored to another classified system used for the most sensitive national security information. The move potentially corrupted a repository supposed to be used only for the nation\u2019s most sensitive secrets with material being protected for a purely political purpose. \u201cThis is a coverup,\u201d said Pelosi, a California Democrat. Democrats believe they now have a \u201croadmap\u201d for the impeachment process announced by Pelosi on Wednesday after months of trying to hold back the liberal tide. Her long-held reluctance to go this far may have strengthened the Democratic hand, since they can now argue that fresh evidence of lawlessness, not the disputed account of events provided by Mueller, forced their hands. Pelosi on Thursday gave Schiff\u2019s Intelligence Committee the lead role in the impeachment inquiry. Schiff\u2019s first move was to release the whistleblower complaint right before a hearing with acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who Democrats accused of holding back the complaint from Congress. The whistleblower complaint, Schiff said, would provide a \u201croadmap\u201d for the committee\u2019s push to interview witnesses and seek document requests over the matter. During the hearing, Maguire, a former Navy SEAL commander, said that both the whistleblower and the inspector general of the intelligence community who deemed the complaint \u201curgent and credible\u201d had at all times followed the law. Here's what Republican senators are saying about the whistleblower complaint The White House, initially stung by the sudden turn of events, is preparing a scorched earth defense. \u201cWe see many Democrats who spent the last two and a half years on baseless accusations and they keep trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last presidential election,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday. Later, it emerged that Trump directly targeted the whistleblower with a veiled hint of violence while addressing US diplomats at the United Nations. \u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump said, according to an audio recording released by the Los Angeles Times. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d Biden responded to the President with his most combative comments of a saga that plays into his central campaign theme that Trump is unfit for office. But Trump\u2019s claims that Biden and his son Hunter are guilty of corruption in Ukraine and China \u2013 for which there is no evidence \u2013 also threaten to emerge as a distraction for the former vice president. At a fundraiser in California, Biden claimed Trump was trying to \u201chijack an election.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019d like to get foreign help to win elections,\u201d Biden said. Biden accuses Trump of trying to 'hijack an election' by pushing Ukraine investigation But Texas Republican Rep. Mike Conaway argued that the President was entirely within his rights to ask a foreign counterpart to investigate corruption \u2013 borrowing the White House\u2019 s explanation for the call between Zelensky and the US leader. \u201cHaving one President ask another President to help the enforcement of laws in alleged wrongdoing,\u201d Conaway said, \u201cis actually appropriate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump tried to explain his agitating approach to life, politics and the rest of the world in a flash of impatience during a blustery news conference in France. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I negotiate. It\u2019s done me well over the years and it\u2019s doing even better for the country, I think,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s comment encapsulated the untamed personality that his fellow world leaders are beginning to get used to \u2013 and work around after his 29 months in office. But in a deeper sense, Trump also shed light on fundamental judgments about his tenure that voters must make before the 2020 election. Trump finds 'unity' after stoking confusion at G7 His political future could rest on whether a sufficient number of Americans decide that the Trumpian tumult of his first term expresses their frustration with the Washington establishment and has delivered the wealth, peace and patriotic pride that he promised in the 2016 campaign. One big risk is that a majority of voters may simply be exhausted by the cacophony of the Trump era that was on display at the weekend at the G7 summit in France and involves chaos, head-spinning policy reversals, lying as a matter of course, perpetual cultural warfare and widening national divides. In other words, is all Trump, all the time, \u201cdoing even better for the country\u201d as the President insists? Trump's rocky weekend includes ups and downs in China trade war The President\u2019s weekend in Biarritz, France, was a classic example of his behavior overseas. His policy choices on Iran, climate, trade with China and trying to get Russian President Vladimir Putin back into the summit despite the opposition of US allies, left America isolated on the global stage. Yet his belligerence was also undeniably an expression of US power since foreign leaders who might not be able to live with Trump but can\u2019t live without America tried not to annoy him. True to his word, the President has made the world\u2019s most powerful nation unpredictable, leaving friends and rivals unsure of what it will do next. Trump skipped a meeting on global warming \u2013 a scientifically proven trend that he has claimed is a Chinese hoax. He made unverifiable claims that China had bowed to his tough rhetoric. He adopted dizzyingly different postures on the trade war. Trump bitterly accused the media of lying when it questioned his narrative of the summit. He indulged his obsession with Barack Obama, slamming the former President on foreign soil in a way that once would have been taboo. And he made a series of bizarre claims and assertions that left his aides struggling to shape believable explanations \u2013 including whether first lady Melania Trump had met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. (She has not, it turns out.) Above all, Trump\u2019s behavior underscored how his combustible personality has transformed the United States from being one of the world\u2019s most stable influences into one of its most disruptive forces.  It was notable how summit host French President Emmanuel Macron played a stabilizing and convening role at the weekend, inserting his nation into the spot of the mature global power once reserved for the United States. Trump chose instead to wage the bellicose daily combat that characterizes most days when he is at home in the White House and that has become the soundtrack of life in America. Trump made another notable comment in Biarritz. \u201cI don\u2019t do things for political reasons,\u201d he said in one of the least credible utterances of a presidency in which almost every decision seems calculated to please his most loyal voters. After landing back in Washington on Tuesday night, Trump tweeted a highly produced campaign-style video showing him side-by-side with world leaders that suggested that he was at the center of events unifying the G7 \u2013 even though in terms of policy and temperament he was often on the outside. While Trump\u2019s behavior horrifies the East Coast establishment, his bull-in-a-china shop performance in France is the key to his appeal among the Trump base. Upsetting leaders of states whom Trump thinks have long exploited US generosity and defense guarantees is just fine with the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d fans who flock to his rallies. Trump\u2019s statement on climate change \u2013 that he won\u2019t lose US wealth on \u201cdreams, on windmills\u201d \u2013 was calculated to play to his blue-collar supporters in industrial Midwest swing states. The President\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy in which the US wins and other states lose has proven to be an effective political strategy among voters who support the President. Some conservative media, meanwhile, took at face value his comments on Monday morning that China had got in touch overnight for new talks \u2013 playing into his claims of being a great dealmaker even though an objective analysis might find little support for such claims. Trump\u2019s relentless attack on the media, including a tweet which claimed improbably that world leaders had asked him why reporters hated America, also plays well with his base. While he peddles obvious falsehoods \u2013 for instance, over the reasons why Russia was thrown out of the G8 summit \u2013 his long crusade against what he calls \u201cfake news\u201d means that his supporters are disposed to believe whatever he says. But there were also signs in recent days that Trump\u2019s erratic methods are catching up with him. His gyrations over China \u2013 from fury to adopting a softly softly approach and buttering up Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2013 have left his strategy on the trade war mired in confusion. Barring an unlikely climbdown by either side, there is no obvious way out of an escalation that could damage the world economy, hurt US consumers and prejudice Trump\u2019s reelection hopes. Trump\u2019s unrestrained behavior also took the focus off some of the weekend successes that could benefit his 2020 campaign. He agreed with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the two sides are close to a trade deal. While there are many details that are unclear about the scope of the pact, it would be a strong data point for him to trumpet on the campaign trail \u2013 even if, like other Trump-era trade agreements, it fails to live up to his spin. Trump\u2019s careful openness to a French effort to broker a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani could be spun as a potential sign of statesmanship and a payoff for his maximum pressure campaign and cool fears of war. Yet the story of Trump\u2019s latest world trip concerned the apparent instability of his character, the coherence of his White House messaging and whether he was up to the job. The President\u2019s habitual challenges to the truth may also be hurting his foreign policy. CNN\u2019s Alison Kosik reported Monday that some traders on Wall Street doubted that any calls or communications had taken place between top US and Chinese officials as Trump claimed. When the word of a communist Chinese government is trusted as much among such an audience as that of a pro-business Republican President, it\u2019s a sign of how Trump\u2019s reshaping of truth has cost him politically. Foreign policy rarely decides elections. And Trump\u2019s performance at the G7 summit will be a distant memory in November 2020. But his showing in France does help clarify the choice for those voters who are undecided about Trump and adds to a mountain of evidence about his character and fitness for office. Trump\u2019s unsteady performance was the latest example of his conduct that left him open to ridicule abroad. There was more ammunition for his critics on this score last week when he canceled a separate trip to Denmark because its prime minister would not sell Greenland to the US. Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 especially former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 are using such infringements of international etiquette to build their case that Trump is an embarrassment as America\u2019s outside face to the world and is therefore not fit for a second term. \u201cAfter three days of meetings in Biarritz, we have even more evidence of how President Trump\u2019s disastrous foreign policy has left the United States isolated while the world moves on without us,\u201d Biden said in a statement on Tuesday after observing a moratorium on criticism of the President while Trump was overseas. \u201cRather than looking to America for vision, agenda setting, and leadership by example, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year\u2019s G7,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president said there was no more telling symbol of Trump\u2019s abdication of global leadership than the \u201cempty chair\u201d at the G7 climate talks.

            "article_content": "The State Department pushed back on comments by the US ambassador to Israel suggesting that Israel has a right to annex part of the West Bank. State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the administration\u2019s position on the West Bank has not changed, despite Ambassador David Friedman\u2019s comments to The New York Times that \u201cIsrael has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank.\u201d Speaking to reporters Monday, Ortagus said that \u201cthe administration\u2019s position on the settlements has not changed. Our policy on the West Bank has not changed.\u201d Asked what the US position on settlement activity is, a State Department official cited President Donald Trump, saying that \u201cas the President has said, while the existence of settlements is not in itself an impediment to peace, further unrestrained settlement activity doesn\u2019t help advance peace.\u201d Israeli settlement activity in the Palestinian territories is illegal under international law, though Israel has always sought to dispute this. The State Department official said they had nothing further to add when asked if the US considers Israeli settlement construction to be illegal. Ortagus on Monday said there was no plan for any sort of disciplinary action against Friedman. \u201cThe ambassador, the secretary and everyone who is involved in the Middle East peace plan, in this entire administration, is working towards a comprehensive and lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians,\u201d she continued. The State Department has been a junior partner in the administration\u2019s efforts to forge a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That initiative has been led out of the White House by Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, along with Friedman and a former lawyer for the Trump organization, Jason Greenblatt. The trio has been promoting the economic aspects of their plan, saying they want to improve Palestinian quality of life, but downplaying the prospect of finding a political solution and playing down the long-standing formula of a two-state solution with both sides having a capital in Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the prospect of annexing some parts of the West Bank in the final days of the recent election campaign in an effort to rally conservative voters. Asked if that move might hurt the chances of peace, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Jake Tapper in April, \u201cI think that the vision that we\u2019ll lay out is going to represent a significant change from the model that\u2019s been used.\u201d Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center and a CNN contributor, said that in previous administrations, Israeli settlement policy was \u201con the radar screen\u201d as an issue. \u201cIt is now not on the radar screen and there is what I would describe as a willful acquiescence to the settlement enterprise,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhen no one challenges statements about annexation, including the secretary of state \u2026 you can\u2019t help reach the conclusion that this is a fundamental reorientation in policy to basically undermine the traditional US approach\u201d of a two-state solution and \u201csome reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians.\u201d Other analysts raised the security implications of annexation. The Israeli Policy Forum, a group that advocates for a two-state solution, said while Friedman\u2019s annexation remarks \u201care not surprising, given his long publicized pro-settlement and anti-two-state outlook, they are disturbing nonetheless.\u201d The Israeli security establishment, most major American Jewish organizations and pro-Israel members of Congress support the idea of two states, the forum said. Annexation would be \u201cdeeply harmful to Israel\u2019s long-term future as a Jewish, democratic, and secure state,\u201d the forum said in a statement, adding that it would create an uncertain security and diplomatic environment for Israel, risk the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and \u201cbe a disaster for Israelis and Palestinians.\u201d",

            "article_content": "For freshman Republican Rep. Carol Miller, work-life balance looks a bit different. While she was running for her House seat last fall, there were times when Miller had to rush back to the bison farm she owns in West Virginia to deal with unexpected problems with the animals she helps raise. Miller has a lot less time to spend on the farm now that she represents West Virginia\u2019s third congressional district, but she still helps out with the work when she can. \u201cI\u2019m not as good a farmer as I was two years ago \u2014 really since I ran for office,\u201d Miller said in a recent interview. Her campaign slogan was a promise to \u201ccut the bull out of politics\u201d and when she got to Washington, she had a bison head mounted on the wall of her Capitol Hill office. That\u2019s not the only unique thing about the congresswoman: Miller is the only new Republican woman in the House of Representatives. While the number of House Democratic women hit a record high after the 2018 midterms, the ranks of House GOP women were cut nearly in half, dropping from 23 women serving in the last session of Congress to now just 13 House Republican women. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that I\u2019m the only Republican woman in the freshman class,\u201d Miller said, but added, \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that we will have more Republican women in the next legislative term.\u201d The congresswoman may play a role in making that happen. Miller is quickly rising through the ranks of House Republicans \u2014 she is already a member of the GOP whip team \u2014 and she wants to help Republicans win back the House majority after Democrats took over in January. As part of that, she wants to help more Republican women get elected to Congress in the years to come. Miller has a sign hanging on the wall in her office that says \u201cA woman\u2019s place is in the House, the Senate and the Oval Office.\u201d The daughter of former Ohio congressman Samuel Devine, Miller has broken glass ceilings over the course of her own career. Before coming to Washington, she was the first Republican woman to serve as majority whip in the West Virginia House of Delegates. But Miller is quick to point out that her \u201cmission was never to be a glass breaker.\u201d She wants the focus to be on her work and she doesn\u2019t want to be defined by her gender. \u201cI didn\u2019t run because I was a woman. I ran because I cared a lot about my state,\u201d Miller said, reflecting on her run for Congress. \u201cI never let my gender identify me.\u201d At the same time, the fact that Miller is the only newly elected House Republican woman and managed to prevail in her congressional race while so many other Republican women did not is now part of what sets her apart in Congress and gives her a unique perspective, one that could prove valuable to her party as it works to recover from the setback of its midterm losses. Republican women planning to run for Congress in 2020 are already seeking Miller out to ask for advice. \u201cThere were some sharp women that ran this last time and I\u2019ve already talked to a few that are going to run in the next election, and I will encourage them,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to many different groups of women. I\u2019m glad to talk to any of them.\u201d When she speaks to women interested in running for Congress, Miller talks about everything from the challenges of fundraising to what it\u2019s like to live your life in a public spotlight. \u201cI talk to them about having a fire in their belly to really want to open themselves up, their whole life, their whole family to thousands and thousands of people,\u201d Miller said, adding, \u201cbecause when you step into a public service mode, you are exposed to people saying whatever they want to say about you.\u201d Miller has also had conversations about the importance of electing more GOP women with Republican Reps. Susan Brooks of Indiana, the recruitment chair for the National Republican Congressional Committee for the 2020 election cycle, and Elise Stefanik of New York, who recently re-launched a political action committee to focus on helping Republican women win primaries and warned after the midterms that the party has reached \u201ca crisis level of GOP women in Congress.\u201d Miller has let both Brooks and Stefanik know that she is supportive of their efforts to recruit and elect Republican women. \u201cCarol Miller knows firsthand the challenges that come with running for Congress as a woman, and she will be instrumental in my efforts to elect more Republican women,\u201d Stefanik told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for her support and friendship.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have her on our team. We wish there were a bunch more of her,\u201d Brooks told CNN. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to be a great recruiting partner for us,\u201d Brooks said, adding that Miller \u201cwants to be helpful because she, like we, recognize that we absolutely need a lot more women in the United States House who are Republicans.\u201d \u201cCongress is a melting pot of many, many people and I think the more people we have with different experiences, the better we can relate to the people that we represent,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo I\u2019m very hopeful there will be more women.\u201d Republicans running in battleground states and congressional districts in the 2018 midterms faced a challenge when it came to the President: Anything less than full-throated support could alienate conservative voters, but to appeal to moderate, independent or swing voters, candidates faced pressure to break with Trump on controversial issues. Miller, however, is an ally and staunch defender of the President and she believes his endorsement and support for her congressional campaign in the deep red state of West Virginia helped her win. Trump traveled to West Virginia several times for rallies in the run up to the 2018 midterms. During one of those visits, Miller was invited inside Air Force One with the President, an experience she says was \u201cincredible.\u201d On another occasion, Miller recalls having a conversation with the President when he jokingly said to her, \u201cHow are those tweets working for you?\u201d a reference to his own Twitter feed. \u201cHe\u2019s got quite a sense of humor,\u201d the congresswoman said, describing the interaction. During her campaign, Miller called herself \u201cpro-life, pro-jobs, pro-coal, pro-Second Amendment.\u201d In office, she has reliably voted in line with the President\u2019s priorities. She talks frequently about how her focus is on issues that impact West Virginia, like improving roads and infrastructure, tackling the opioid epidemic, and promoting workforce development in a state hard hit by the decline of the coal industry. \u201cPeople in West Virginia are hard-working, resilient people, and they suffered the hopelessness of having their jobs taken away and their communities leaving,\u201d she said. Miller\u2019s two sons and five grandchildren live within a mile of her home in West Virginia and she says her \u201cpriorities are to work on the issues so that people can keep their families here in West Virginia and be with their grandchildren like I am.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m always selling our state, come, bring jobs to our state, we want your jobs. We\u2019d love to have your business in our state,\u201d Miller said, adding, \u201cI want people to realize what a great place it is.\u201d On a recent day on Capitol Hill, Miller had a jam-packed schedule. In between votes on the House floor and two committee hearings, she had a series of meetings, including speaking with a group of West Virginians, hosting a member of the Parliament of Georgia in her office and stopping by a reception for the National Motorsports Coalition. Miller is still new to Capitol Hill, but she is forming friendships with other lawmakers, including members of House GOP leadership, and even some Democrats \u2013 and making progress at a faster clip than one might expect for a freshman member. The congresswoman was named a member of the House GOP whip team shortly after the start of the new Congress and she describes House GOP leaders Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise and Liz Cheney as \u201cwonderful people.\u201d When she first got to Congress, Scalise came to her office to meet members of her family who had traveled to Washington for her swearing-in ceremony. \u201cWith her background as majority whip in West Virginia, she was the perfect person to add on to the whip team,\u201d Scalise told CNN, saying, \u201cthere aren\u2019t many freshmen that I add.\u201d \u201cCarol\u2019s a doer. She\u2019s a worker,\u201d he added. \u201cShe came here with a purpose and those are the kind of people I look for.\u201d Miller has gotten to know other lawmakers through the committees she serves on. \u201cYou become family,\u201d Miller said. \u201cYou pray together, you laugh together, you battle together.\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform committee, is one of the people Miller has become close with. But it\u2019s not just Republicans. \u201cAcross the aisle, there are people that I like and I\u2019m getting to know,\u201d Miller added. The congresswoman counts Democratic freshmen Reps. Katie Hill of California and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia as friends. Miller has also joined a bipartisan women\u2019s prayer group made up of lawmakers from both the House and the Senate. \u201cAt this stage, I\u2019m still getting to know everybody and I\u2019m concentrating on my committee work,\u201d she said, describing what it\u2019s been like to be in Congress so far. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of players out there, lots of people, and it\u2019s fascinating, it\u2019s exhilarating. I mean there are so many adjectives you could use for Washington, DC,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s enjoyable. It\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s all of those things.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As Sen. Bernie Sanders prepared to take the stage at a Fox News town hall event Monday night, a shouting match broke out on the street below. A man walking between the SteelStacks event center and the rusty blast furnaces of the old Bethlehem Steel plant carried a pro-Trump sign that read \u201cBuild the Wall.\u201d \u201cF\u2014 the wall!\u201d yelled another man walking in the opposite direction. He then approached a large group of Trump supporters and engaged them in the same way. A few of them, wearing Trump hats and waving Trump campaign signs, mocked him right back. The scene was evidence of what\u2019s at stake here in this suburb 70 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Sanders was showing up on enemy airwaves, trying to reach a critical sub-set of voters \u2013 middle-class, mostly white suburbanites in Pennsylvania, many of whom likely watch Fox News. Trump supporters, meanwhile, had gathered outside as a reminder that, to many people, this is still Trump country. The politically split Lehigh Valley is in many ways the crucial battleground district of a crucial battleground state. The President eked out a win here in 2016 on his way to carrying Pennsylvania, making him the first Republican presidential candidate to win the Keystone State since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Trump did so in large part by appealing to the type of working-class suburban voters found in Bethlehem and its bigger twin city across the Lehigh River, Allentown. While Republicans have won House and Senate elections in Lehigh Valley in recent years, the tide has turned blue recently. Moderate Democrat Susan Wild won the US House seat here in 2018, and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey dominated here in his reelection bid. To beat Trump in 2020, the Democratic candidate, whether it\u2019s Sanders or someone else, will need to do a better job of appealing to the concerns of suburban swing voters in this part of Pennsylvania. That means talking about kitchen-table issues like education and health care and improving the infrastructure of what\u2019s become a growing hub in the Mid-Atlantic. Whichever party\u2019s candidate figures out how to speak to those concerns won\u2019t just win voters in the Valley \u2013 they could likely win Pennsylvania and the presidency, too. \u201cThe Lehigh Valley is a bellwether,\u201d says Charlie Dent, the moderate Republican who represented much of the area in Congress from 2005 to 2018, and who is now a CNN contributor. \u201cIf Trump wins here, he wins the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d He added, \u201cIf he loses here, it\u2019s not a good sign for him with similar kinds of voters in different parts of the country.\u201d The Lehigh Valley is the definition of a transitional community. It\u2019s neither rich nor poor, not as well-off as the Philadelphia suburbs but not as depressed as Pennsylvania coal country. The region has a long history of industrial development, from its iron and concrete industries in the 19th century to the growth of Bethlehem Steel into a symbol of American industrial might. But the overall decline of heavy industry in the last half-century has forced the region to modernize. Unlike some other areas in America\u2019s Rust Belt, the Valley has been relatively quick to bounce back. Its unemployment rate, at 4.4% is roughly in line with that of the rest of the state and slightly above the national average of 4%. Situated between Philadelphia and New York and bisected by Interstate 78, the region has become a commercial hub, with warehouses and distribution centers for big companies like Walmart and Amazon. The lower cost of living has been a magnet for younger people looking to escape more expensive cities. What might have been the hollowed-out industrial shell that Billy Joel sang about in his blue-collar anthem \u201cAllentown\u201d is now a humming middle-class oasis. It\u2019s these places of transition \u2013 between the rural and the urban, between the old economy and the new \u2013 that are the key to both parties\u2019 success in 2020. The problems and concerns are those of a middle-class in good but still uncertain times. \u201cI think there\u2019s just a general stress,\u201d says Dent. \u201cPeople feel like they\u2019re working more and getting less. They\u2019re just dealing with the struggles of life. Health care costs are high, tuition is what it is, and I think it\u2019s just stressful.\u201d There\u2019s a cultural tension too, as the makeup of the Lehigh Valley changes with migration. According to a US Census Bureau estimate, more than 60% of the region\u2019s new residents were immigrants from foreign countries. While the rural parts of the region remain culturally conservative, and staunchly aligned with the GOP, the more densely populated areas closer to Allentown and Bethlehem are growing friendlier to moderate Democrats as more families from the New York and Philadelphia move in. Other than the rising cost of living, many in the Valley say the bigger economic problems are good ones to have: lots of job openings but without enough skilled workers to fill them. Those necessary skills in the logistics, health care, and biotech industries growing in the region including everything from technological savvy to familiarity with intricate systems like medical codes. And people here say better funding and accountability for schools and training programs could be a part of closing the skills gap. For the most part, however, the booming economy is being felt in the Lehigh Valley, and the current administration is reaping the benefits. \u201cI\u2019m a born-again Trump guy,\u201d says Frank Facchiano, the COO of the Lehigh Valley Regional Chamber of Commerce. Facchiano says the tax bill, passed in 2017 by a Republican-led Congress and signed by Trump, has been a good thing for business as well as families and individuals. It\u2019s hard for Sal Panto, the Democratic mayor of Easton, to disagree. \u201cI think the policies are still good,\u201d he said. He worries, too, that his own party could be failing to put up the right kind of challenger to Trump. \u201cBernie Sanders is so far left of our party,\u201d Panto said of the current Democratic frontrunner. If the economy is doing well and the Democrats are turning too far left, why isn\u2019t the Valley, and therefore Pennsylvania and reelection, a lock for Trump? \u201cThe area has gotten more anti-Trump, because of his antics,\u201d says Panto. Dent agreed. \u201cWhether you like Trump or not, I think there\u2019s a lot of concern about his behavior,\u201d he said. He noted that Wild, his Democratic successor, spent little time in her successful campaign focused on going after Trump in particular. Panto said there\u2019s a benefit for his party in letting the President damage himself. \u201cThe more he is out in public, the better it is for Democrats,\u201d Panto said. Pennsylvania\u2019s top elected officials are watching the Lehigh Valley closely. Immediately downstairs from the Sanders town hall on Monday, the Chamber of Commerce was holding its annual dinner honoring local mayors and municipal governments. The guest of honor was Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, who took part in a Q&A. \u201cA lot of people are going to come through Pennsylvania,\u201d Wolf said, when asked about the 2020 presidential election. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re going to ultimately decide.\u201d Perhaps recognizing the mixed political audience, Wolf avoided saying he would support the eventual Democratic nominee and spoke only in broad terms about what he expected Pennsylvania voters, including those in the Valley, would seek in a candidate. \u201cI think people are looking for integrity, I think they\u2019re looking for competence, and if they can see those two things, I believe we\u2019re going to give any candidate a pretty wide latitude on policies,\u201d Wolf said. The audience of business and municipal leaders applauded heartily.",

            "article_content": "Small-dollar contributions helped propel Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar to a big fundraising haul as the Minnesota freshman faced intense controversy over her remarks and drew the ire of some powerful Republicans as well as high profile members of her own party in the nation\u2019s capital. The Democrat raised more than $832,000 during her first three months in Congress \u2013 a substantial haul that puts her ahead of other House members in Minnesota\u2019s delegation and several other closely watched freshman Democrats. About half of Omar\u2019s first-quarter haul came from individuals who contributed $200 or less \u2013 one measure of grassroots financial support, new filings with the Federal Election Commission show. CNN has reached out to Omar\u2019s office to request comment. Pelosi: Democrats have 'no taint' of anti-Semitism in their party Omar, a Somali-American and one of just two Muslim women serving in Congress, has become a polarizing figure in Washington and faced criticism for controversial remarks related to Israel, including charges of anti-Semitism from Republicans and some Democrats. She publicly apologized in February after a backlash from both sides of the aisle for comments she made on Twitter that appeared to suggest that support for Israel in Congress is fueled by money tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, often short-handed as AIPAC, a prominent pro-Israel group. The congresswoman\u2019s comments sparked condemnation from House Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said in a statement that \u201cCongresswoman Omar\u2019s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel\u2019s supporters is deeply offensive.\u201d At the same time, however, progressives have embraced and championed her as an important voice within the Democratic Party, raising concerns for her safety and arguing that she faces a different standard as a Muslim and woman of color. Larger donors to Omar\u2019s campaign this year include the campaign committee of South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a member of the House Democratic leadership. He donated $1,000 at the end of March. Omar\u2019s fellow freshman and one of her most vocal defenders, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also contributed $2,000 to the Minnesotan\u2019s campaign in late March, Federal Election Commission finding show. New York man charged with threatening to assault and kill Rep. Ilhan Omar Ocasio-Cortez recently called on other members of Congress to defend Omar and raised concerns over the congresswoman\u2019s safety after President Donald Trump posted a video to Twitter juxtaposing imagery of the September 11 terror attacks with footage of the congresswoman making a speech in which she referenced the attacks. The President\u2019s video has been widely denounced by Democrats as an incitement against the congresswoman and Omar has said that there have been an increase in threats on her life in the wake of the tweet. Omar\u2019s first-quarter figures push her ahead of some other freshman Democrats raising substantial sums ahead of tough re-election races. For example, Rep. Antonio Delgado, who defeated a Republican to capture an Hudson Valley, New York district in 2018, raised a hefty $755,000 during the first quarter. California Rep. Katie Hill, who unseated a Republican in Southern California last year, raised more than $600,000. Omar\u2019s fundraising exceeded even that of the high-profile Ocasio-Cortez, who raised more than $726,000 during the January-to-March fundraising period. If she keeps up the fundraising pace, Omar likely will quickly surpass the $1.08 million she collected during the entire, two-year election cycle in 2018. CNN\u2019s Sunlen Serfaty contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump provided Benjamin Netanyahu both temporary refuge from ongoing scandal and a de facto campaign venue at the White House when he hosted the embattled Israeli prime minister for talks Monday. Cementing the sense he was providing a gift to Netanyahu as his election nears, Trump signed a proclamation formally recognizing the contested Golan Heights \u2013 considered Israeli-occupied territory by the international community \u2013 as part of the state of Israel. Trump had previewed that decision last week in a tweet, but Monday\u2019s move formalized the policy. \u201cToday I am taking historic action to promote Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself and really to have a very powerful, very strong national security, which they\u2019re entitled to have,\u201d Trump said before signing the measure. He handed his pen to Netanyahu to deliver to the \u201cpeople of Israel.\u201d \u201cThis was a long time in the making,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShould have taken place many decades ago.\u201d The meeting reinforced the close bond between Trump and Netanyahu, who were dressed alike in red silk ties and referred to each other with endearment. Trump called Netanyahu a \u201cspecial man\u201d and referred to him by his \u201cBibi\u201d nickname; Netanyahu termed Trump his \u201cdear friend Donald.\u201d The meeting, which was announced last week, came as Netanyahu faced new allegations of corruption, which are piled on top of accusations he used his position for personal gain. Legal plights have been a shared burden for Trump and Netanyahu over the past several years. But Trump is entering the week with some of his troubles lifted: special counsel Robert Mueller has ended his investigation and found no evidence Trump or his associates colluded with Russia, according to the attorney general. The investigation was less determinative on whether Trump obstructed justice. But nevertheless the President plans to use the conclusion to attack Democrats and his opponents for leading a fruitless probe. Trump to host Netanyahu just two weeks before Israeli elections In mounting his own self-defense, Netanyahu has employed some of the same tactics as Trump, decrying his accusers as politically motivated, lambasting \u201cfake news\u201d and even using the term \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to describe the various corruption cases. The claims of misconduct come as he\u2019s facing the toughest re-election bid of his political career. Trump discarded past US practice by agreeing to meet with Netanyahu within weeks of the election. Initially scheduled over two days, including dinner with Trump on Tuesday evening, Netanyahu announced on Monday he was cutting his trip short to return home after a rocket fired from Gaza struck a house in central Israel. Minutes before Netanyahu arrived to the White House, the Israeli military announced it was striking Hamas targets in Gaza. Trump decried the attack in remarks on Monday. \u201cOur prayers are with our friends in Israel as they carry out an incredible way of life in the face of great terror,\u201d he said. Even Netanyahu\u2019s truncated visit was meant to bolster his political standing in Israel, where Trump remains popular. At the same time Netanyahu was meeting Trump at the White House, his main opponent in the April elections, retired Army chief of staff Benny Gantz, was addressing the yearly conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, held at the Washington Convention Center across town. Netanyahu was also scheduled to address the gathering on Tuesday but his announced return to Israel will preclude him making an appearance that has been a traditional centerpiece of the conference. US Democrats this year have been reckoning with whether to appear at AIPAC, which has come under criticism for advocating against the Iran nuclear deal. In recent weeks, Trump has harshly criticized his political opponents as being anti-Israel, citing comments he claims are anti-Semitic. In addition to aiding Netanyahu in his election bid, the Golan Heights move also appeared designed to give Trump a boost among pro-Israel voters in the US. \u201cThe Democrats have very much proven to be anti-Israel, and it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Trump claimed on Friday morning at the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t know what has happened to them, but they are totally anti-Israel. Frankly, I think they are anti-Jewish.\u201d",

            "article_content": "They once were Donald Trump\u2019s strutting, sharp-suited alpha male political and legal fixers, living high and playing the game hard, seemingly immune from the consequences of their willingness to walk on the dark side. But now, hubris has humbled Roger Stone, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. One is already in jail, another is headed there and Stone narrowly escaped with his liberty Thursday but was gagged by a judge he had threatened on Instagram. All three men have been indicted or convicted or have pleaded guilty to crimes and alleged offenses that in most cases are not directly linked to their work for the President. But had they not eagerly dived into Trump\u2019s shark tank and had he not run for President they would not have drawn the attention of special counsel Robert Mueller and possibly other prosecutors in cases that led to their downfall. The White House line, whenever one of the President\u2019s men goes down, is that none of it has anything to do with Trump. Technically, that is often true: So far none of the trio has been charged with a conspiracy to collude with Russia, for instance. Yet all three are under suspicion of allegedly communicating with Russian intelligence assets, contacts or alleged front organizations like WikiLeaks. Washington is on alert to see if any of those episodes will be referenced in Mueller\u2019s final report, which could be delivered to Attorney General Bill Barr as early as next week. What is clear is that these are men who Trump has been happy to have by his side. While their partnerships were working and before prosecutors swooped, he never seemed troubled by their dubious reputations and bare-knuckle tactics. In fact, it may have recommended them to him. Stone, a protege of Trump mentor and mob lawyer Roy Cohn, has moved in the President\u2019s world for decades. He is his longest political adviser, after a self-styled career as a dirty trickster fashioned after his hero Richard Nixon. Cohen, who is expected to lift the lid on some of the President\u2019s life and business secrets in what could be a sensational Capitol Hill hearing next week, made himself indispensable as a man who cleaned up Trump\u2019s messes. And Manafort traded in the life of a jet-setting international political consultant who rubbed shoulders with oligarchs to turn Trump, the 2016 GOP primary victor, into a nominee who could make a run at the presidency itself, as his campaign chairman. If their story has a common moral, it is this: Sooner or later, even hard-charging political and legal bruisers who seem to fly unrestrained by the normal rules can eventually fall foul of the law and see lives of notoriety crash to ruin. Only time, Mueller, various other legal proceedings and a flurry of congressional investigations will tell whether Trump himself will learn the same hard truth or was smart enough to avoid the fate of his tainted operatives. In a 2008 New Yorker profile, Stone explained one of his \u201crules\u201d to Jeffrey Toobin, who is also CNN\u2019s chief legal analyst. \u201cAttack, attack, attack \u2013 never defend,\u201d he said. \u201cAdmit nothing, deny everything, launch counterattack.\u201d That was his approach a few weeks ago in his first court appearance in Florida, when he was defiant and reveling in the attention \u2013 flashing Nixon\u2019s \u201cV for victory\u201d sign with his hands above his head on the courtroom steps. But there was no attack, attack, attack on Thursday. That Roger Stone was nowhere to be seen in a Washington courtroom. He was abject and apologetic after he was hauled in to explain his Instagram post. Roger Stone cannot speak publicly about case, judge rules His bravado drained out of him on the day a life of political chicanery finally claimed its price. \u201cI don\u2019t offer any rationalization or excuse or justification. This is just a stupid lack of judgment,\u201d he told the furious judge, pleading his case by saying he was having trouble putting food on the table and paying rent owing to legal fees. Stone has been walking the line, and crossing over it, for decades. In effect, he was being cross-examined by Judge Amy Berman Jackson for being Roger Stone. And now, thanks to the full gag order, which will prevent him talking about the case in the media, that persona must go silent on the subject that interests him most \u2013 his political tricks. \u201cHe has played this character for his entire career, and today I think he went up against the wall,\u201d said David Urban, who masterminded Trump\u2019s victory in Pennsylvania in the 2016 campaign and is now a CNN commentator. \u201cHe has always pushed the line, and I think he went over that line today and he got smacked down pretty hard by the judge,\u201d Urban said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead.\u201d Jackson told Stone that his apology rang hollow and she wasn\u2019t impressed with his explanations. \u201cThis is not baseball. There will not be a third chance,\u201d she said. The depth of his plight might have begun dawning on Stone as the gag order was formally imposed. \u201cHe just put his head in his hands, he leaned back and it looked like his eyes were closed, letting the reality of this sink in,\u201d said CNN reporter Kara Scannell, who was in the courtroom. Cohen attached himself to Trump more than a decade ago, glorying in the role of the legal strongman who took care of business. \u201cThey say I\u2019m Mr. Trump\u2019s pit bull, that I\u2019m his right-hand man,\u201d Cohen once said. He was not beyond threatening reporters in the vernacular of a mobster. When his famous client became a presidential candidate, Cohen turned himself into a political surrogate for the man he always referred to as \u201cMr. Trump.\u201d \u201cHe took care of what had to be taken of. I don\u2019t know what had to be taken care of. But all I know was Michael was taking care of it,\u201d Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg told CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger last year. Once, Cohen said he\u2019d \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump. No more. The former fixer now feels that his association with Trump has led him to personal destruction. In December, a federal judge sentenced him to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging payments during the 2016 election to two women who claimed affairs with Trump. \u201cThe man doesn\u2019t tell the truth \u2026 And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds,\u201d Cohen told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos in December, saying he had lied for Trump for 10 years \u201cout of loyalty to him.\u201d \u201cI will not be the villain of his story,\u201d Cohen said. Michael Cohen came to Capitol Hill ahead of his testimony next week After several false starts, Cohen is due to testify to the House Oversight Committee next Wednesday in public, in what could turn into one of the most compelling congressional circuses in recent memory. While Cohen is likely to paint a grim picture of Trump, Republicans will seek to impugn his credibility, given that he is already a proven liar. Cohen caused a stir on Thursday by showing up on Capitol Hill and spending several hours in the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s secure rooms ahead of his closed-doors testimony to that panel, also scheduled for next week. Senators are likely to quiz him on many issues \u2013 including his efforts to broker a Trump Tower project in Moscow, even during the presidential campaign. Another Trump associate who tumbled to earth in the most humiliating fashion was Manafort. Before he was snared by Mueller, Manafort was an uber-lobbyist and the epitome of Washington\u2019s swamp culture, exporting the dark arts he learned as a GOP operative to several unsavory political characters abroad. He worked for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, in just one of the contacts that have drawn the interest of Mueller. The work was lucrative. His riches bought an ostentatious wardrobe that included ostrich and python skin jackets. He shopped at House of Bijan, reputedly the most expensive men\u2019s store in the world, according to court documents. Swamp on trial: Why people are hooked on the Manafort case Manafort also built a bloated real estate portfolio, with one home boasting an outdoor kitchen financed from offshore accounts. His Hamptons hideaway included a $10,000 karaoke system and a giant flower bed in the shape of an M. But his spending sprees also led him to take a $10 million loan from a Russian oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin, a connection that has raised suspicions that he might have been compromised by Moscow. Now Manafort may be facing the rest of his life in jail. He will be sentenced for his conviction of financial fraud on March 8, a federal judge in Virginia said Thursday. He will be sentenced in Washington, where he pleaded guilty to conspiracy and broke a plea deal with Mueller, on March 13. Even before long years behind bars, Manafort is a painfully diminished figure. In his most recent court appearance last month, he had to ask the judge for permission to wear a suit instead of his dark green prison duds. His sunken appearance and now almost completely gray hair shocked observers \u2013 after he limped into court using a cane \u2013 in contrast with the cocky self-assurance he once showed while lording over the Trump campaign.

            "article_content": "As special counsel Robert Mueller wraps up his investigation, important questions remain about Paul Manafort\u2019s dealings with Russians while he ran the 2016 Trump campaign and his motive, which prosecutors believe is at \u201cthe heart\u201d of their inquiry. Mueller\u2019s team recently revealed that they are zeroing in on an August 2016 meeting between Manafort and a Russian associate who the FBI says had active ties to Russian spy agencies. Both Manafort and the Russian, Konstantin Kilimnik, deny collusion but acknowledge that they discussed the presidential campaign. \u201cThis goes to the larger view of what we think is going on, and what we think the motive here is,\u201d Mueller team prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told a judge last week at a closed-door hearing. \u201cThis goes, I think, very much to the heart of what the special counsel\u2019s office is investigating.\u201d Mueller's team to file sentencing recommendation on Manafort in Virginia case The judge ruled Wednesday that Manafort lied to investigators and to the grand jury about his contacts with Kilimnik. These topics were \u201cmaterial to the (special counsel) investigation,\u201d Judge Amy Berman Jackson wrote, highlighting the significance of Manafort\u2019s continued cover-up. Manafort\u2019s relationship with the elusive Kilimnik is well-documented. They worked together in Ukraine for nearly a decade, lobbying on behalf of pro-Russia politicians. But the public is still learning the extent of their contacts at key moments in the campaign. New details are still trickling out nearly three years after Manafort joined President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, like the recent revelation that Manafort shared sensitive polling data with Kilimnik. The motive behind their interactions \u2013 emails, calls and face-to-face meetings \u2013 is still an open question. As Manafort sits in his Virginia jail cell, largely out of public view since June and legally prohibited from discussing the case, the void has been largely filled by others. Mueller\u2019s team on Friday will submit a sentencing recommendation with the Virginia federal court where Manafort was convicted of tax and bank fraud. In the memo, prosecutors could sketch out their theory of Manafort\u2019s motivations or shed new light on his criminal conduct. Judge voids Paul Manafort plea deal, says he 'intentionally' lied to the FBI, special counsel and grand jury Some see Manafort as a greedy grifter, desperate for a payday, looking out for only himself. He made $60 million from his Ukraine work. But he was essentially broke by the time he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016, largely because his wealthy patrons in Ukraine were forced from power in the 2014 revolution. As Weissmann put it, \u201cMr. Manafort had a liquidity issue.\u201d Even so, Weissmann pointed out to the court, Manafort was working for the Trump campaign for free. Kilimnik told The Washington Post that, during the August 2016 meeting, he and Manafort discussed \u201cbills unpaid by our clients.\u201d At the time, Manafort was owed more than $2 million from his Ukrainian backers for work he did prior to the Trump campaign, a spokesman told CNN. There are some signs that Manafort tried to use his role on the campaign not to collude with Russia but instead to enhance his future business prospects. In 2017, The Washington Post published emails showing how Manafort asked Kilimnik to offer private election briefings to a Russian billionaire. Manafort bombshell deepens mystery in Russia probe On the other hand, some Democrats and Trump opponents have long believed that if there was collusion by Trump\u2019s campaign, then Manafort could be the linchpin. After all, his Russian ties before the campaign were extensive. And he just can\u2019t stop lying about them. They also point to the infamous dossier, authored by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, which claimed that Manafort personally oversaw the Trump-Russia cooperation on behalf of the campaign. \u201cThe darkest interpretation here is that Manafort was essentially the connection from the Trump team over to the Russian side,\u201d said Steve Hall, the retired CIA chief of Russia operations. \u201cFor me, the fact that Manafort wanted to talk to the Russians about the campaign indicates that they were interested in the campaign, not just trying to peddle influence with a Trump administration.\u201d Read: Judge rules on Manafort plea deal If investigators have a theory regarding Manafort\u2019s motives \u2013 greed, collusion, something in between or something else altogether \u2013 they\u2019ll soon have an opportunity to share it with the public. Next week, they\u2019ll file sentencing memos that are expected to shed light on some of these unsettled questions. Manafort, 69, faces 10 felony convictions in two different federal jurisdictions and will be sentenced in the coming months. He could realistically spend the rest of his life in prison. At the closed-door hearing last week, Weissmann said that Manafort might have repeatedly lied about his Russian contacts because he was trying to boost his shot at a pardon from the President. So far, Trump has refused to rule out a pardon for his former campaign chairman. \u201cThis is my opinion, but Weissmann does have some political biases, and at this point, he probably thinks Trump is full of it, and that frustration is coming out,\u201d said Shan Wu, a former federal prosecutor who previously represented Manafort\u2019s deputy Rick Gates. \u201cBut based on his reputation for thoroughness, Weissmann wouldn\u2019t say that in open court unless they had some evidence pointing to the value of what Manafort is hiding.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Paul Manafort\u2019s latest legal debacle deepened the core intrigue underlying special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe: Why have so many of President Donald Trump\u2019s associates been caught lying about contacts with Russians? In a significant new twist in the 2016 election saga, a judge ruled Wednesday that Trump\u2019s ex-campaign chairman \u201cintentionally\u201d lied to investigators, breaking a deal he had reached as a cooperating witness. The lies, including about meetings with a suspected Russian intelligence asset, were about issues intimately linked to Mueller\u2019s wider inquiry, which includes a look into whether there were any links or coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian election interference effort. Taken in isolation, the new Manafort bombshell would have rocked any presidency, given his senior role in the Trump campaign. But for a White House as cloaked in suspicion as this one, after two years of stunning revelations about Moscow\u2019s election interference, it is yet more bad news that will fuel a feverish atmosphere and further crank up pressure on Trump\u2019s inner circle. Like many of the stunning reveals from Mueller, the latest Manafort drama also offered tantalizing glimpses into the special counsel\u2019s web of investigation but provided no resolution to the long-running Russia puzzle. Mueller has yet to provide any proof of a conspiracy or cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russians, despite obtaining convictions and guilty pleas from a string of the President\u2019s former associates. McCabe says he ordered obstruction probe on Trump in order to preserve Russia investigations But Wednesday\u2019s developments will be seen in an even more foreboding light given the multiple lies, changes of story and obfuscations offered by other Trump confidants about contacts with Russian officials or private citizens. These include former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s calls with then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s shifting story about a meeting with Russians promising \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton and the President\u2019s own misrepresentations about a proposed construction project in Moscow. None of these activities are necessarily illegal, making it even more difficult to understand why there was an apparent need to cover them up. \u201cThis is the million-dollar question in the entire investigation,\u201d Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who\u2019s a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cCuomo Prime Time.\u201d \u201cYou just have to start asking yourself, why did all of them lie about their connections to the Russians?\u201d The judge\u2019s ruling represents a personal tragedy for Manafort, 69, once a high-flying uber lobbyist in an ostrich skin jacket who racked up millions in consulting fees and huge debts before joining Trump\u2019s team. \u201cIt\u2019s doom for Paul Manafort,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, referring to the likelihood that the increasingly frail former political operative\u2019s existing jail term for tax and bank fraud will now likely be extended. The end result could mean he dies behind bars. But the wider legal and political ramifications of the ruling are also staggering and are likely to revive speculation about the reckoning that may eventually await Trump from Mueller\u2019s final report. According to Judge Amy Berman Jackson, Manafort lied to the FBI, the special counsel and the grand jury about his contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a political operative who is believed to have ties to Russian intelligence. Judge voids Paul Manafort plea deal, says he 'intentionally' lied to the FBI, special counsel and grand jury The ruling partly relates to a meeting between Manafort and Kilimnik at a Manhattan cigar bar on August 2, 2016. Thanks to a botched legal filing last month by Manafort\u2019s lawyers, it has emerged that Mueller believes Manafort shared polling data and spoke about Russia-Ukraine policy with Kilimnik. In a sealed hearing last week, one Mueller prosecutor, Andrew Weissman, told Jackson that Manafort\u2019s meetings with Kilimnik go \u201cvery much to the heart of what the special counsel\u2019s office is investigating.\u201d Exclusive: William Barr gears up to take the reins on Mueller probe and pick a top deputy Jackson, in voiding Manafort\u2019s plea deal, ruled that he had also lied about $125,000 he had received for legal bills and about an unnamed separate Justice Department investigation. She decided that Mueller\u2019s team did not prove that Manafort had lied on two additional matters \u2013 over contacts with White House officials or about Kilimnik\u2019s role in an attempt to influence witnesses. Manafort\u2019s counsel argued that their client did not intentionally lie about anything. But it is Manafort\u2019s interactions will Kilimnik that will draw most questions in the days ahead, amid rising speculation that Mueller is approaching the end of his investigation. For instance, was Manafort lying because he is simply, as has been proven through months of legal proceedings that ended with a conviction on bank and tax fraud charges, a congenital liar? Or did he have a more sinister aim? Was he trying to cover up wrongdoing that was material to the investigation into whether there was cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Russians? Could his obstruction therefore be part of an attempt to protect the President in the hope of attracting a pardon? Or was he simply operating independently, seeking to curry favor with key Eastern European figures to mitigate his own plight and financial exposure, given his millions of dollars in debt owed to Oleg Deripaska, a Russia oligarch? \u201cThere appear to be two reasons why he may do it \u2013 one, that he thinks he can get a pardon,\u201d said John Dean, White House counsel to President Richard Nixon at the time of Watergate, on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d \u201cThe second reason he might be lying \u2026 is fear for his life and his own family\u2019s well-being \u2026 he has been playing with Russian heavyweights who do not like to have anybody go in and testify against them or reveal their secrets,\u201d Dean said. Former Trump White House lawyer James Schultz, currently a CNN legal analyst, raised the question of whether Manafort was acting on official business or merely trying to ease his personal troubles in meeting Kilimnik. \u201cDid it have something to do with trying to help the campaign or was it that he was trying to repay a debt that he owed?\u201d Schultz said, referring to Manafort\u2019s alleged handover of polling data. \u201cWas he acting in the scope of duties as campaign chairman or was he acting in the scope of trying to protect Paul Manafort?\u201d Schultz asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d In other words, was Manafort meeting with Kilimnik to rekindle his own once-lucrative business relationships in Ukraine, where he worked for pro-Russia politicians, or seeking to coordinate with Russia to influence the election? The answer to that question could go a long way toward revealing whether the most alarmist interpretations of the unfathomable links between Trump associates and Russia are part of a wider plot or just a web of murky, personal ties. Mueller could already know the answer. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately attribute a quote to Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan.",

            "article_content": "Sen.-elect Mitt Romney sits down for a live interview with Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d at 4 p.m. ET today on CNN. There\u2019s a tendency to assume Mitt Romney\u2019s op-ed critical of President Donald Trump is a big deal. After all, Romney not only was the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee but is also set to become a senator from Utah this week. And what he wrote was deeply critical of the way in which Trump has approached the presidency. Of Trump, Romney wrote: \u201cHis conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the President has not risen to the mantle of the office.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! The Romney op-ed, which ran in The Washington Post, got A LOT of attention \u2013 as he (and we) knew it would. And Trump responded \u2013 \u201cHere we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast!\u201d \u2013 as he (and we) knew he would. It was all a Very Big Deal. But here\u2019s the thing: I am very skeptical that any of this matters at all \u2013 in terms of how Trump conducts himself and/or how the elected Republican leaders in Washington interact and react to him. The first observation is patently obvious to anyone who has watched Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 or his life. He is who he is. The chances a 70+-year-old man who is currently the President of the United States changes his approach to life because a politician who has long been a critic writes an op-ed are, roughly, 0%. If you need proof of that \u2013 and if the first two years of Trump\u2019s presidency aren\u2019t proof enough \u2013 simply look to his tweeted response to Romney\u2019s op-ed \u2013 in which he urges the soon-to-be Utah senator to \u201cbe a TEAM player & WIN!\u201d The second thought \u2013 that Romney\u2019s op-ed will change nothing about how Republican senators and House members interact with Trump \u2013 is also based on recent observations. Take Romney. Yes, he was the most high-profile critic of Trump \u2013 at least among those Republicans not running against him \u2013 during the 2016 primary race. Romney gave a speech during the spring of 2016 in which he blasted Trump, saying, among other things, that \u201cdishonesty is Donald Trump\u2019s hallmark.\u201d And yet, after Trump won, Romney met with him when the President was apparently weighing naming the former Massachusetts governor as secretary of state. While Romney was occasionally critical of Trump during the 2018 Senate campaign, he said and did nothing even close to as overt as this Post op-ed when it could have hurt him electorally. Romney\u2019s record of opposition to Trump is not entirely consistent, to put it nicely. Who\u2019s to say that he will keep it up for the next two years (or longer)? Even if Romney does keep it up, there\u2019s reason for skepticism that his critique of Trump\u2019s approach to the presidency will have any actual impact on his colleagues. Over the past two years, Trump had several prominent Republican critics in the Senate \u2013 Jeff Flake, John McCain and Bob Corker being the three best known. This is not a thank-God-someone-finally-said-it! sort of moment. Flake was driven into retirement by his anti-Trump views. Corker\u2019s political strength was affected as well, and he decided not to run again. McCain, afflicted with terminal brain cancer, passed away last year. And for all of their speaking out and appealing to the better angels within their colleagues\u2019 hearts and minds, Flake, McCain and Corker had zero measurable impact on rallying the Senate (or the House) against Trump. If anything, they served as examples of what not to do \u2013 challenge Trump and watch your base run away from you, never to come back. The Republican Party \u2013 as reflected by its elected officials in the House and Senate \u2013 became more pro-Trump between the end of 2016 and the end of 2018.  It did so for a variety of reasons, the main ones being: 1) to accomplish long-standing goals like a major tax cut or the confirmation of a slew of judges from the Supreme Court on down 2) to survive politically. The belief that op-eds like Romney\u2019s might change things within the Republican establishment are, therefore, based on a false premise: That there is any sort of measurable Republican Party outside of those who align with Trump. There is not. The 2018 election showed that. The path to victory for Republican candidates \u2013 particularly in GOP primaries \u2013 was to get as close to Trump as possible and never let go. Distancing yourself from the President was a recipe for Republican disaster. Romney\u2019s op-ed is then rightly understood not as a political earthquake but as a lone scream into the void. Sure, Trump has flatly rejected the idea of the presidency as a position of moral leadership. And yes, his policies are a clear break from what the GOP stood for even a few years ago. But the idea that an op-ed will change how Romney\u2019s soon-to-be Republican colleagues will act toward Trump between now and the 2020 election is a total and complete fallacy. That ship sailed a long time ago. And no words written in a Washington Post op-ed are going to bring it back into harbor.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In the musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d Thomas Jefferson returns to a turbulent United States after five years in Paris and sings, \u201cSo what\u2019d I miss?\u201d If you were spending this week focused on your job, school, health, family or just getting ready for Thanksgiving, instead of riveted to your screen, you might have the same question. The answer: A lot. Three days of televised House committee hearings that brought Democrats closer to impeaching President Donald Trump. A debate that exposed key differences between the 2020 candidates. A controversy over Prince Andrew\u2019s interview that led him to pull out of public life. An election in deep-red Louisiana that narrowly kept a Democrat in the governor\u2019s office. And the opening of two feel-good blockbuster movies, \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d and \u201cFrozen 2.\u201d The pivotal political moment came Wednesday, when Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland gave his opening statement to the House Intelligence Committee, noted Michael D\u2019Antonio: \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s abuse of power has been confirmed by a witness with direct involvement in the scheme.\u201d At times, Sondland seemed almost gleeful as he outed Trump, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and top administration figures as players in an effort to extract a political favor from Ukraine in return for vital military aid from the US. \u201cWith his testimony, Sondland portrayed the Trump-Giuliani scheme as constructed out of lies and fantasies and characterized the schemers to be aggressive, abusive and heedless of the damage they were doing to both the United States and Ukraine. As the military aid was delayed, battles raged and soldiers died,\u201d D\u2019Antonio wrote. The next day, former National Security Council senior director and Russia scholar Fiona Hill decisively rejected the right-wing conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine, rather than Russia, for interfering in the 2016 US election. Hill \u201ctold the committee and the nation that America is \u2018being torn apart\u2019 by the erosion of a shared idea of truth,\u201d wrote Ruth Ben-Ghiat. \u201cTrump and the GOP, in de facto partnership with Fox News, are creating an alternate reality for followers in which facts are what the President needs them to be.\u201d Sondland\u2019s testimony, wrote legal analyst Elie Honig, \u201cput to rest two mainstays of the Republican battery of defenses for President Donald Trump: That the investigation was not based on firsthand information, and that there was \u2018no quid pro quo.\u2019\u201d Honig said the last credible defense for the President is to blame it all on Giuliani going \u201crogue.\u201d The key question now, according to former Watergate assistant prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste and Kelly B. Kramer, is whether the evidence supports the constitutional standard for impeachment and removal from office, which mentions \u201cbribery\u201d along with \u201cother high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d While noting that \u201cthe facts are still emerging, and there is much that we as Americans do not know about how and why President Trump acted as he did,\u201d Ben-Veniste and Kramer concluded that there\u2019s already \u201ca strong prima facie basis for concluding that the President solicited a bribe.\u201d Sondland\u2019s opening statement caught Republicans \u201cflat-footed,\u201d wrote Scott Jennings. But as harmful as the ambassador was to Trump\u2019s defenses, Jennings added, \u201clater in questioning, Sondland muddied those waters by flatly stating that \u2018No one told me the aid was tied to anything. I was presuming it was.\u2019\u201d Polls taken before the latest testimony show no sign that Trump is losing support as a result of the impeachment inquiry, Jennings noted, and they reveal \u201cthe structural problems Democrats face in convincing any Republican to support their impeachment dreams. The truth is, most Americans have their minds made up on Trump one way or the other and no impeachment hearing will change that.\u201d Whatever the long-term impact, Elliot Williams gave House Democrats credit for building a methodical and powerful case: \u201cDemocrats\u2019 behind-the-scenes decisions over who would speak, for how long, and in what order were nothing short of genius.\u201d \u201cLook, the case has been made,\u201d wrote Peggy Noonan, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan. \u201cAlmost everything in the impeachment hearings this week fleshed out and backed up the charge that President Trump muscled Ukraine for political gain \u2026 It became clear in a new and public way that pretty much everyone around the president has been forced for three years to work around his poor judgment and unpredictability in order to do their jobs.\u201d Republicans Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan trotted out a variety of gambits to question the credibility of the witnesses, wrote Julian Zelizer. \u201cRather than having a debate about whether the President\u2019s actions were impeachable, Republicans instead treated the nation to a week of wild-eyed accusations that simply pushed aside the alarming reality that credible witnesses \u2014 public servants all \u2014 laid before them.\u201d Polka fans Bill Bishop and his wife made a 65-mile move five years ago from his \u201cultra-hip, ultra-Democratic Austin neighborhood\u201d in Texas to \u201cLa Grange, a town of approximately 4,800 on the Texas prairie where the local DJ plays polka in the mornings (along with Tom T. Hall\u2019s not-quite-classic \u201cWho\u2019s Gonna Feed Them Hogs\u201d). And where Republicans are as plentiful as pearl-snap shirts \u2026 We crossed from one political reality to another. In the 2016 Presidential election, there was a 50-point difference between the place we left and the community we had moved to.\u201d Kicking off the second part of CNN Opinion\u2019s special report on the \u201cFractured States of America,\u201d Yaffa Fredrick drew the full picture of how the nation got this way: \u201cAmericans have sorted themselves into predominantly liberal and conservative enclaves. Social media has accentuated partisan division and enabled extremists to get their views out. And the political system has abetted the fracture by drawing voting district lines in ways that encourage members of Congress to resist compromise.\u201d For an example of the harmful effects of gerrymandering, read David Daley\u2019s account of how it changed Asheville, North Carolina, once a toss-up district that was sliced up to advantage conservative Republicans in Congress. \u201cOf course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains. And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy \u2014 and many politicians \u2014 beyond the reach of the ballot box.\u201d As John Avlon pointed out in a piece on partisan media, \u201cA new Pew survey shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That\u2019s a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems.\u201d For those confronting a politically fraught Thanksgiving dinner this week, our experts have an interactive guide to help. After years of controversy, Chick-fil-A said it would stop donating to two organizations that have been criticized for being anti-LGBTQ and instead focus on the causes of \u201ceducation, homelessness and hunger.\u201d It wasn\u2019t nearly enough for Richard Morgan, who wrote, \u201cThis would perhaps be more convincing if Dan Cathy, Chick-fil-A\u2019s CEO, acknowledged as wrong, and directly apologized for the comments that he made in 2012 about the company\u2019s belief and support of the \u2018the biblical definition of the family unit.\u2019\u201d Allison Hope, a writer and LGBTQ activist, cautioned that there are reasons to applaud what the company is doing: \u201cif we condemn them even while they\u2019re making moves to be better \u2014 regardless of the reason and especially when right-wingers are also bashing them \u2014 we risk alienating them and others who are watching.\u201d In what was widely seen as a public relations disaster, Prince Andrew spoke in an interview with the BBC about his friendship with the convicted sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein. \u201cThe prince\u2019s lack of humanity or perspective as he answered the questions put to him was astonishing,\u201d wrote Kate Maltby. \u201cEven when invited to offer a closing statement, Andrew didn\u2019t offer an expression of sympathy to Epstein\u2019s victims \u2026 \u201cHe doesn\u2019t regret his friendship with Epstein, because the man\u2019s \u2018extraordinary ability to bring people together\u2019 gave him wonderful networking opportunities. Where else might a prince pick up networking opportunities?\u201d There\u2019s a larger issue, she noted. To justify the \u201cunearned privilege the royals enjoy,\u201d defenders of the system argue \u201cthat to be raised royal is to undergo a unique educational process that by definition instils virtue and duty in those who experience it \u2026 Prince Andrew\u2019s decision to open up to the cameras this week blew that argument out of the water.\u201d The expected debate pile-on against Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who has been surging in Iowa polls, didn\u2019t happen in the Democrats\u2019 fifth debate, held in Atlanta Wednesday. \u201cHe has yet to have a bad debate performance and emerged from this one unscathed,\u201d wrote Tara Setmayer. \u201cHe once again exhibited policy depth on issues from health care to farm subsidies and thoughtfulness when challenged by Kamala Harris on issues of race. Buttigieg also demonstrated he can counterpunch with the best of them particularly on foreign policy.\u201d Debate coach Todd Graham gave Buttigieg and Andrew Yang As, and ranked Kamala Harris highly: \u201cShe\u2019s a master at criticizing others without coming across as a jerk. She called out Tulsi Gabbard for spending \u2018four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama\u2019 before going on to admonish her for efforts to be chummy with Trump and Steve Bannon, and her criticism of the Democratic Party. It was a horrible look for Gabbard. On policy, Harris also shone \u2026\u201d At a farmer\u2019s market, poet Tess Taylor overheard a woman lamenting a year\u2019s worth of environmental catastrophes with the despairing conclusion, \u201cWe\u2019re so far beyond doomed.\u201d Taylor understood what she meant. \u201cIt\u2019s enraging, depressing, exhausting,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn the Bay Area newly intense firestorms come to our door, weekly.  In our warming seas, the kelp forests of California are dying off, threatening ocean fishery collapse.\u201d  And yet she found hope this year in a book that might spark conversation around the Thanksgiving table: \u201cWilding.\u201d Isabella Tree tells the story of the 700-year-old English farm she and her husband inherited. When they could no longer make a go of it, they decided to let their land go largely wild and were surprised by the result. \u201cThe process called back more dense and diverse species than even experts had imagined was possible,\u201d Taylor wrote. \u201cEven what seemed invasive at first made sense in time: One year a meadow filled up with thistles, which seemed like a nuisance, but also provided cover for a bumper crop of beneficial insects and butterflies. Tree\u2019s love of species names buoys her discoveries along, and her careful observations about the interconnectedness of even overlooked creatures seemed to give us all reason to hope.\u201d This Thanksgiving, David Perry\u2019s family is ordering a cooked turkey, breaking with its tradition of following an elaborate recipe which uses 30-plus ingredients in its stuffing and requires \u201can every-15-minute basting regime.\u201d Perry\u2019s mother died last year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to make the decision to order Thanksgiving dinner this year. I wanted to do it \u2018right.\u2019 I wanted to re-create the memories of the cooking, to roll back time, to feel like I did when my mother was here. But that\u2019s not possible.

Sara Stewart saw \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d at the Toronto Film Festival and fought back tears. Tom Hanks portrays the children\u2019s show host Fred Rogers and it\u2019s \u201cpretty darn close to a must-see,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut it was when I came back home to western Pennsylvania that I really began to reflect on how much we still need Rogers, a native of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and a longtime Pittsburgh resident,\u201d she observed. \u201cWe need his teachings more than ever, particularly in the complicated, deeply divided region he called home.\u201d She recounts moving to the small town of Indiana, Pennsylvania, from New York City four years ago. \u201cWe hiked in the woods and kayaked in the lake.

He is a CNN political commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. While much of the 2019 election discussion focused on the Kentucky and Mississippi gubernatorial contests and the Virginia state legislative races, there were pivotal countywide races in Pennsylvania that provide a much clearer view of the political realignment we have been slowly witnessing for many years in my home state. The lesson learned from Pennsylvania, which went for Donald Trump in 2016, is the same as for the rest of the country.  As a result of his election and performance in office, the suburbs are nearly completely gone for the Republican Party. When I was first elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1990 from an Allentown-based district, Republicans performed very well in the suburbs and dominated rural areas. There were even a few Republicans like me who were winning elections in urban areas and even more Democrats who were successful in rural communities throughout the state and well beyond the Philadelphia region. But things were slowly changing. In 1990, while I and two other Republicans were defeating entrenched Democratic state House incumbents in the Lehigh Valley, a perennial bellwether and swing region of eastern Pennsylvania, an almost unheard of young man and young woman defeated an entrenched Democratic congressman and Democratic state senator, respectively, from the other side of the state, in the Pittsburgh area. Their names: Rick Santorum and Melissa Hart. Four years later Rick Santorum became a US senator, and ten years later Melissa Hart gained a seat in the US House of Representatives. These 1990 election results were shocking to the political class at that time. How did five Republicans defy political gravity to win Democratic districts in the midterm election during the Presidency of George H.W. Bush? This should not have happened, but what we were witnessing was an emerging trend. Southwestern Pennsylvania was strongly Democratic in terms of voter registration but was increasingly receptive to Republican candidates. At roughly the same time in 1992, we were witnessing Republican slippage in the most populous and most Republican collar county outside Philadelphia, Montgomery County, which elected a Democratic congresswoman, Marjorie Margolies Mezvinsky, who replaced the retiring, moderate Republican congressman, Larry Coughlin. That too was a political earthquake. What does any of this have to do with the election of November 5, 2019?  Plenty. In 1990 we had pro-choice Republicans and pro-life Democrats elected to statewide office. Remember Gov. Robert P. Casey, Sr.? Moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats were very much alive and well in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Back then we often spoke of the \u201cCatholic\u201d or \u201cCasey\u201d Democrat \u2013 pro-labor, pro-life, pro-gun; today, we no longer speak this way. In fact, during presidential elections in the 1990s and 2000s in southwestern Pennsylvania there were significant numbers of Democrats who were functional Republicans, and in southeastern Pennsylvania there were many Republicans who were functional Democrats. Today, most of these voters have aligned their party affiliations with their voting habits. Since the 2016 Presidential election we have witnessed an acceleration and the culmination of the Democratic dominance, takeover and sweep of the populous suburban collar counties of Philadelphia. Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties\u2019 Republican majority Boards of Commissioners fell to the Democrats last Tuesday; Montgomery County lost its board majority several years earlier. North of the Philadelphia collar counties, Lehigh County, which includes Allentown and part of Bethlehem, lost its Republican board majority, as did Monroe County in the Poconos. These defeats in the Philadelphia suburbs on Tuesday were every bit as devastating as the Republican losses in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC, and Richmond, or the Kentucky suburbs of Lexington, Louisville and Cincinnati. And that says something, since northern Virginia Republicans were shut out in the House of Delegates races in the suburban communities of Alexandria, Arlington and Fairfax. For the GOP, the suburbs are the new Florida In Pennsylvania, the defeat of the Delaware County commissioners is both stunning and historic, but given the trends, not surprising. Republicans have controlled the board since the Civil War and operated a legendary political machine. Chester County, too, was Republican dominated as far as anyone can remember. The silver lining for Pennsylvania Republicans on Tuesday was the flipping of six county governments from Democrat to Republican in largely rural southwestern and northeastern Pennsylvania counties. Luzerne County, which twice voted for Barack Obama and by a wide margin for Donald Trump, flipped to the Republican column. That\u2019s the good news for Republicans, but it pales in comparison to the losses of the large population centers in the counties that went Democratic. The ever-expanding circle around Philadelphia and other urban population centers poses an existential threat to the GOP. It\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where Republican losses in the suburbs can be offset by increased gains in rural areas; the math simply doesn\u2019t work. Yes, the rural areas of Pennsylvania, and America more broadly, are becoming more Republican and red while the suburbs are becoming more blue and Democratic. But it\u2019s better to grow and win in areas where the population is increasing rather than in areas of population stagnation or decline, and that is the key Democratic advantage heading into 2020. Overall, the Pennsylvania elections of 2017, 2018, and 2019 were very unkind to the Republican Party and the trend does not bode well for next year.  2020 could be another terrible Republican year given President Trump\u2019s high unfavorability ratings that are driven by his increasingly erratic behavior and misconduct in office. Maybe he can pull another inside straight in Pennsylvania where he won in 2016 by 44,000 votes while losing big in the Philadelphia suburbs. That said, the political environment is worse now than in 2016, making Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania re-election prospects improbable and imperiling down-ballot congressional and state legislative candidates.  Of course, the Democratic presidential nominee will also shape and condition the 2020 political environment. If the Democrats were to nominate, say, Sen. Elizabeth Warren or another candidate sharing her extreme views, Donald Trump\u2019s election prospects would rise considerably in Pennsylvania. Warren\u2019s plans to ban hydraulic fracking by what would likely be an illegal executive order and impose punitive wealth taxes, and her general hostility toward industrial and agricultural America, will drive even more rural votes to Trump and likely mitigate his losses in suburban communities. Whatever their views of Trump, large numbers of Pennsylvania voters would see Warren as a very real and immediate threat to their economic interests and values. Many suburban voters view the Republican brand as too nativist and socially intolerant. If the Republican Party ever hopes to reclaim lost territory in the suburbs and elsewhere, it can start by rejecting isolationism and protectionism, advocating constructive international engagement by reengaging with traditional allies and defending the American-led international order, embracing diversity and inclusion, and striving to become more socially sensible. If demography is destiny, then Republicans must get on the right side of it. Otherwise, the results of the 2020 election for the Republican Party in Pennsylvania will make the previous three dreadful elections pale in comparison.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael Bociurkiw is a global affairs analyst and a former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Follow him on Twitter @WorldAffairsPro. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his; view more opinions on CNN. By any stretch of the imagination, Justin Trudeau, the steward of the family brand, had a humiliating election night. Not only was Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party forced by voters to accept a demotion to a minority government \u2013 grabbing just 157 of 338 seats in the House of Commons \u2013 but about two-thirds of the country voted against him. His party\u2019s share of the popular vote clocked in at just 33.1 % \u2013 less than the 34.4% earned by the rival the Conservative Party of Canada and its leader Andrew Scheer. (Despite receiving a greater percentage of the vote, the Conservative Party picked up 36 fewer seats than the Liberals.) In order to have won a second majority, the Liberals would have had to hit or exceed the magic number of 170 seats. Trudeau went into Canada\u2019s 40-day election campaign with major headwinds blowing against him \u2013 not least of which was the ascendancy of third parties in eastern Canada that were well positioned on election night to force a minority coalition government. The Trudeau election juggernaut was also thrown off course midway through the campaign after photos surfaced showing him wearing blackface at multiple points when he was younger. Perhaps as a result of these setbacks, the Liberals lost many seats in western Canada, and in fact were completely wiped out in oil-rich Alberta and agriculture-dependent Saskatchewan, signaling widespread displeasure there over the imposition of a punitive carbon tax, oil pipeline politics and arrogant indifference over their frustrations. After most of the votes were counted and the victory and concession speeches delivered, Canadians could not be blamed for feeling a nasty election hangover: the speeches by the three leaders came across as almost tone-deaf, with little to calm concerns that the country\u2019s divisions are getting even bigger. An extreme, but not entirely unrealistic, view might be that the ghosts of the past of separatist tendencies in Quebec and Alberta have been revived. If ignored by Trudeau and his coalition partners, that could bring very unwelcome instability for years to come. In his post-election speech that came across as more of a campaign speech than an attempt at national healing, Trudeau seemed to have sensed western alienation, reminding Canadians in that region: \u201cYou are an essential part of our great country. I\u2019ve heard your frustration and I want to be there to support you.\u201d Why Justin Trudeau's reelection is no sure thing For a minority Trudeau government to survive any confidence vote or pass major legislation, the Liberal leader will have to negotiate with the junior parties. Canada\u2019s international cooperation on such things as peacekeeping may be more difficult to achieve and that could end up leaving Canada diminished on the world stage. Moreover, minority governments in Canada usually have a shelf life of less than 24 months, so Canadians will probably be headed back to the polls within two years. In some ways, Canada\u2019s 43rd election campaign was remarkable for being so unremarkable, right up until voting day on Monday. What I heard from many Canadians as I traveled across this vast country over the weekend is that they struggled to identify a single burning issue that influenced their ballot choice. \u201cOne thing was true throughout this campaign; voters, especially those on the left of centre, were uncertain about what they wanted. Even last week, with fewer than seven days until the election, just half of voters said they were locked into their top choice in this election,\u201d said the non-profit independent research foundation Angus Reid Institute. To be sure, the environment ranked very high in voters\u2019 minds \u2013 but oddly that did not translate into significant gains for the Green Party, which ended the day with just three seats, even though it is meant to be the standard-bearer for climate action. Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party wins Canada's general election In a minority situation, the Trudeau government will be forced to strike a working relationship with the pro-labor New Democratic Party, which opposes one of Trudeau\u2019s key energy security projects, the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline between oil-rich Alberta and coastal British Columbia. The NDP and other parties have questioned the viability of the new North American Free Trade Agreement. And the Bloc Quebecois, which picked up more than 30 seats, advocates for a bigger voice in Ottawa and special privileges for Quebec. In an election that was more about leadership and personalities than issues, Canadians witnessed toxic attack ads and somewhat un-Canadian insults on the leaders\u2019 debate stage. With many candidates \u2013 most with extensive digital footprints \u2013 there was plenty of social media dredging and scraping that kept the war rooms of the parties working overtime. One of the most extraordinary, almost unexplainable political stories emerging out of Canada in the past two years has been the fall in Trudeau\u2019s star power. A series of missteps forced him into the position of having to convince Canadians that he has the good judgment to continue on as prime minister. Aside from the blackface incident, Trudeau fought headwinds created by the disastrous 2018 state visit to India, allegations that the government bullied a former attorney general into granting favorable treatment to Quebec engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, and taking a Christmas family vacation to a private Caribbean island owned by billionaire and Ismaili Muslim leader, the Aga Khan. After being found to have broken multiple federal ethics rules, Trudeau apologized, saying: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t, and in the future I will be clearing all my family vacations with the commissioner\u2019s office.\u201d On the SNC-Lavalin affair, Trudeau has not apologized, saying his focus was on protecting Canadian jobs. (However, now that his minority government will no longer control parliamentary committees, there could be more probing into his government\u2019s past actions). \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for standing up for Canadians\u2019 jobs. That\u2019s my job.\u201d Curiously, overseas, Trudeau still seems to possess star quality, albeit somewhat diminished. Even former US President Barack Obama felt the need to tweet his support of the Liberal leader last week, saying \u201cthe world needs his progressive leadership now.\u201d But Canadians care little about having a celebrity prime minister, preferring someone who is happy staying at home and rolling up their sleeves to get the job done. What may have harmed Trudeau is his penchant for foreign travel, rubbing shoulders with the Davos elite and gushing feature spreads in glossy magazines such as Rolling Stone.  Down but not out, Trudeau may want to start his second term with a reshuffle of his inner circle \u2013 installing political sages who are more adept at optics and keeping their leader out of harm\u2019s way. \u201cThe problem with the Trudeau inner circle is they drink too much of their own Kool-Aid,\u201d Ottawa-based political consultant Yaroslav Baran told me. Tuesday morning, most Canadians probably woke up dissatisfied, concerned about the state of Canadian unity and whether their political leaders have the fortitude to look beyond their own shortsighted self-interest. But again, given the tone of the post-election speeches, don\u2019t expect significant gestures from any of the party leaders \u2013 including Trudeau. If Canadian voters feel let down, they cannot be blamed.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. For lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people and our allies, the 2020 presidential election will be the most important election of our lives. Over the last two years, the Trump administration has rescinded key protections for transgender students, appointed two new anti-equality justices to the US Supreme Court, banned transgender troops from serving openly in the military, and repeatedly pushed policies that would open the door to discrimination against LGBTQ people in healthcare, housing, public accommodations and other aspects of life under the guise of \u201creligious liberty.\u201d Despite campaigning on a promise to be a \u201creal friend\u201d to the LGBTQ community, Donald Trump designated Mike Pence (who has previously called homosexuality \u201ca choice\u201d) as his vice president. And Trump has been outspoken about his opposition to bipartisan federal civil rights legislation \u2013 the Equality Act \u2013 which overwhelmingly passed through the US House of Representatives this year and, if signed into law, would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Against this backdrop, on Thursday the Human Rights Campaign Foundation will join forces with CNN for a historic Democratic presidential town hall devoted to issues crucial to the LGBTQ community. On the eve of National Coming Out Day, this town hall will be the first time a major cable news network airs a presidential event devoted to LGBTQ issues. LGBTQ rights are on the brink and in the spotlight this week The 2020 presidential election will determine whether the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on LGBTQ rights are allowed to continue \u2013 or whether we begin the work of restoring our democracy. And while the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, for LGBTQ people in particular, there also could not be a greater opportunity to make change. Over the past several election cycles, LGBTQ people and our allies have been exerting more and more political power \u2013 dramatically altering the political landscape. Today, there are 11 million LGBTQ voters estimated nationwide who will play a decisive role in the upcoming elections. We have also identified 57 million \u201cEquality Voters\u201d \u2013 friends, family members and other allies who prioritize LGBTQ-inclusive policies when deciding which candidates to support. During the 2018 midterm elections, the Human Rights Campaign successfully worked to mobilize Equality Voters in key races across the country. In fact, Equality Voters accounted for 29% of the electorate in 2018, making it one of the most substantial voting blocs in the election. Turnout among Equality Voters increased from 36% in the 2014 midterm elections to 56 percent in 2018. This trend is only expected to continue in 2020. Firing Virginia teacher who misgendered student was the right call LGBTQ people and our allies played a key role in pushing candidates over the finish line in dozens of races with groundbreaking consequences. Specifically, Equality Voters helped protect the Senate\u2019s first out LGBTQ member, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and elect another out member, Senator Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona. Equality Voters helped elect and re-elect governors who are working to enact critical non-discrimination protections, outlawing the dangerous and abusive practice of so-called \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d and acting as a powerful backstop against anti-LGBTQ state legislation. And Equality Voters helped restore a pro-equality majority in the House of Representatives that passed the Equality Act. This is part of a growing trend. In 2016, LGBTQ voters and our allies helped oust former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory after he signed into law a draconian anti-LGBTQ bill known as HB2. According to a CNN exit poll, 65% of 2016 North Carolina voters opposed the law. During Alabama\u2019s special election in 2017, the coalition built by groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the NAACP played a role in defeating anti-LGBTQ zealot Roy Moore and electing Doug Jones to the US Senate. With so much at stake in 2020, we are eager to hear how these candidates will fight for full federal equality, defend the fundamental rights of LGBTQ people and protect the most vulnerable \u2013 both here and around the globe \u2013 from stigma, institutional inequality, discrimination and violence. But at its core, the participation of these top-tier candidates and the platform provided by a major cable news network underscore the importance of LGBTQ issues and the power of our votes.  Fifty years ago, when the first brick was thrown at Stonewall and the modern LGBTQ-rights movement was born, few could have imagined ten candidates for president competing for the support of the LGBTQ community. But as recent years have shown, increasing support for equality means our movement is no longer limited to organizing and mobilizing self-identified LGBTQ people. The rising Equality Vote has the potential to put LGBTQ issues at the center of electoral decision-making and activism \u2013 both in 2020 and beyond.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion articles on CNN. Is Donald Trump trying to make peace with Iran even while his close ally Benjamin Netanyahu is looking for a fight? Recent headlines, from both the G7 in Biarritz and from Syria and Lebanon, seem to suggest that events are moving in precisely that direction. If Netanyahu\u2019s not careful he might risk involving the US in a war that Trump doesn\u2019t want and undermining the diplomacy with Iran that he does. French President Emmanuel Macron seems to have made some headway in getting President Trump to consider a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in the next several weeks. Meanwhile as if to underscore the unpredictability of the region, Israel conducted a series of strikes in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon against Iran and its allies. Tensions are high, awaiting a response from Iran or Hezbollah. So are we moving toward peace or war and can a friendlier Trump on Iran be reconciled with a more aggressive Israel? With this President, it\u2019s impossible to know whether his warming to the idea of a meeting with Iran\u2019s president represents a strategic shift of some kind or just another confusing and contradictory day in the life of the Trump presidency. Trump has repeatedly stated his desire to sit down with Rouhani to negotiate a  new deal on the nuclear issue \u2013 one he deems, unlike the Obama accord, to be to  America\u2019s advantage. And yet most everything we\u2019ve seen from the Trump administration to date has been maximum pressure. But there are several new elements: France\u2019s Macron is actively trying to broker this meeting, hoping it will occur within weeks; both Trump and Rouhani will be in New York at the UN General Assembly at the end of September; and Trump even suggested extending a line of credit to Iran given how much the sanctions are hurting. It\u2019s a pretty sharp turnaround for Trump. But you can see why he might be interested: he loves these summits for reasons of ego and vanity, he can demonstrate to the Europeans that he can do diplomacy, he can outflank the Democrats who have criticized his warlike position on Iran without giving up much in return or loosening sanctions. In Netanyahu's hour of need, Trump is nowhere to be seen Of course, therein lies the rub. Rouhani \u2013 ever fearful of getting too far out ahead of Iran\u2019s real decision maker, the Ayatollah Khamenei \u2013 stated Tuesday  there could be no meeting without the US removing all of its sanctions against Iran. Iran isn\u2019t North Korea where Trump could enter into a two-year negotiating process and not produce significant results. Iran desperately needs sanctions relief and Trump needs to demonstrate that he won significant concessions from Tehran for granting it. It\u2019s hard to see Iran playing along with Trump\u2019s summit of vanities \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to see what trade-offs would satisfy both sides. Is Israel Going to War with Iran? Probably not. But events of the past several weeks, including this weekend\u2019s Israeli strike on an Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah position southeast of Damascus  and a  drone in Beirut, the city that houses Hezbollah\u2019s headquarters, have raised tensions considerably. The Israeli-Iranian shadow war \u2013 ongoing for several years now \u2013 is no longer in the shadows. Israel has had considerable success in preventing Iran from creating permanent bases and military production facilities in Syria through its use of air power. But the Iranians as a consequence have moved many of their assets to Iraq, especially missiles, and the Israelis \u2013 upsetting the Americans in the process \u2013 have expanded their operations in Iraq, targeting pro-Iranian militias to disrupt weapons transfers. Israel's ban on Omar and Tlaib is a big mistake Indeed, the most recent Israeli operation in Syria, against IRGC and Hezbollah, which reportedly killed two Hezbollah fighters, was apparently intended to preempt an Iranian revenge attack on Israel for an attack Israel conducted in Iraq in July. The region is awaiting the drop of another shoe as Hezbollah has threatened to attack Israel after the recent drone operation in Beirut which destroyed a control panel on a piece of machinery vital for creating  propellants that can improve missile accuracy. The only piece of good news is that none of the four major actors who determine whether there will be war \u2013 Russia, Iran, Israel and Hezbollah \u2013 want a major blowup. Still, the situation remains volatile and a major Israeli-Iranian confrontation will contract, not expand, the prospects for US-Iranian diplomacy. The question of whether we  are moving toward war or peace with Iran has been made even more complex by the onset of Israeli elections set for September 17. The possibility that Trump may actually meet Rouhani (there has not been any high-level US-Iranian engagement since the 1979 Iranian revolution) must have thrown Netanyahu for a giant loop. There has been no reaction from the Prime Minister. But here he is running a reelection campaign on  the basis of his close relationship with Donald Trump \u2013 the man who took America out of the what Netanyahu believes is a horrible nuclear accord. And here is his good friend considering meeting with the Iranian president or, worse still, negotiating with him. And unlike his determined effort to criticize Obama for the 2015 nuclear accord, Netanyahu can\u2019t say a negative word about Trump\u2019s possible meeting, lest he alienate him.  At the same time, increasing tensions with Iran carries an advantage that allows Netanyahu to demonstrate his credentials as Mr. Security. Netanyahu made it known that he had monitored Saturday\u2019s attack against Iran in Syria all night at Air Force Headquarters and he\u2019s invited his key opponent \u2013 Benny Gantz \u2013 to a briefing on the security situation in the north. Still, it\u2019s a fine line. Security drowns out every other issue in an Israeli election campaign. So it plays to Netanyahu\u2019s advantage. But  a miscalculation and  too tough a response if and when Hezbollah retaliates could create an escalatory cycle tripping into a messy war with Hezbollah that leads to significant Israeli casualties \u2013 not a good campaign narrative on the eve of an election.",

In another time, the President of the United States might have called an urgent press conference on Monday morning \u2013 making sure he could command the world\u2019s attention \u2013 and issued a stern warning that violent repression of peaceful protesters is intolerable. After all, what we saw this weekend in Moscow and Hong Kong were alarming signs that a wave of more brutal repression is looming. The regimes in Moscow and Beijing have sent notice that they are about to crush peaceful, popular movements. This should alarm the US president and produce an urgent response. Instead, President Donald Trump woke up Monday morning prepared to stoke racist sentiment across the United States, tweeting a new barrage of inflammatory messages against prominent African American figures in what has become a familiar pattern: racist tweets from the President, widespread condemnation by the public, doubling down by the President. Trump is making racism his trademark, spending his time energizing racists while decisively removing America from the moral high ground. Perhaps not coincidentally, this is happening at the time when democracy activists most desperately need a show of support. They could use a strong statement from Washington telling the leaders in Russia and China that the world is watching. That their actions could have consequences. That, at the very least, their position on the global stage is teetering. That the American people stand on the side of those demanding justice. Consider what happened in Russia, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting for the right to vote after authorities brazenly disqualified opposition candidates for an upcoming municipal election. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval has been sliding, discontent growing, and the largest protests in years have taken place, even though Russian law now makes it nearly impossible to obtain a protest permit. Cooper: Something about meeting Putin makes Trump giddy This weekend, police sent rows of menacing riot police to break down a peaceful protest, arresting more than a thousand people in Moscow. Most alarming is what happened to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose very life may well depend on whether the rest of the world makes it clear to the Kremlin that, if he is killed, there will be consequences. Navalny was arrested earlier in the week after calling for a demonstration. Then, suddenly, on Sunday, he was rushed to a hospital with what the hospital called an \u201cacute allergic reaction.\u201d He does not suffer from allergies. The news immediately brought to mind the fate of other Kremlin critics who have faced, shall we call it, biochemical issues. Recall the horrific disfigurement of former Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian politician who dared to challenge Putin\u2019s preferred candidate in 2004. He narrowly escaped death after being poisoned with dioxin. He believes the Kremlin was behind the assassination attempt. The Kremlin stands accused of poisoning other Putin critics, even exiled ones, including Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium poisoning blamed on Putin by a UK inquest, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter, poisoned in Salisbury, England. British authorities have accused two Russian men of carrying out the hit, saying they belong to Russian military intelligence. The men say they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury. Why Trump's racist dog whistle won't work this time Other Kremlin critics have died mysterious deaths. The popular politician and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, shot in front of the Kremlin, former ally Boris Berezovsky, who supposedly killed himself, and many, many courageous journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists counts 28 Russian journalists killed since 2000, the year Putin rose to power. Navalny\u2019s personal doctor says he has been taken back out of the hospital into prison against her advice. She thinks he has been poisoned. Perhaps it was a warning, perhaps an attempt on his life. Navalny, back in prison on Monday, suggested he may have been poisoned while in police custody. A well-articulated warning from Washington might just save him and others. A warning to Beijing is just as urgent. For weeks the people of Hong Kong have waged peaceful protests against a government that is supposed to be independent of China under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model agreed when the territory reverted to China from the UK. Protests started against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, where the legal system is beholden to the Communist Party-controlled regime. The protests have been massive, bringing out as many as two million people in a territory of just seven million, underscoring how widespread and intense the distrust of China is. Beijing has been growing impatient, and the signs are nothing short of ominous. Donald Trump's most catastrophic decision Last week, the spokesman for the Chinese military, Wu Qian, issued a chilling reminder that China\u2019s military forces could be quickly deployed inside Hong Kong if the territory\u2019s authorities request it. Then he described the protests in a way that made very clear Beijing is running out of patience. The protesters\u2019 behavior, Wu declared, \u201cis intolerable.\u201d That was Wednesday. On Sunday, Hong Kong police clad in riot gear launched a harsh crackdown against demonstrators. CNN\u2019s Anna Coren, in the midst of the mayhem, was visibly horrified. The protesters were completely peaceful, she said. On Monday, China issued its sternest warning yet, accusing pro-democracy protesters of committing \u201cevil and criminal acts.\u201d One shudders to think what might come next at the hands of the regime that massacred protesters at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago. When the tanks rolled in Tiananmen, then-President George H.W. Bush wasted no time publicly condemning the regime, as have other American presidents who spoke firmly and decisively against repression.  Sure, America has failed many times, and its own history is far from immaculate, but the words of a credible American president can help draw the moral lines. It may or may not stay the hand of a tyrant, it may or may not prevent a massacre. But at the very least it helps clarify what is and is not legitimate conduct in our time. Even if it fails to stop a catastrophe in progress, it may give second thoughts to another tinpot tyrant watching from a distance. How tragic for America and for the world that Washington today is dominated by a President who thinks nothing matters more than his personal fate and believes inciting racist hatreds at home tops the national agenda.",

The people of Hong Kong have secured a remarkable victory, but they have far more cause to worry than to celebrate. A cloud of anxiety hangs over Hong Kong\u2019s future. Their odds are daunting, their enemies powerful. But their freedom is at stake; that\u2019s why Hong Kongers turned out in force against a controversial extradition bill last month, surprising even themselves with the strength of their voice in a weekend protest. Organizers estimated that an incredible two million people (police said hundreds of thousands) \u2013 out of just over seven million residents \u2013 filled the streets, sending a message not only to their local government but to the regime in Beijing, which is steadily eroding their rights. The people won a battle against the local government, but the real threat comes from a far more implacable force. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is backing away from the bill that sparked the biggest protests in the territory\u2019s history and Sunday night made a rare apology for \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the government\u2019s work. But Hong Kong\u2019s troubles are nowhere near over. Under the 1997 handover of Hong Kong\u2019s sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, Beijing is not supposed to take full control of the semiautonomous territory until 2047, but the Chinese government is already nibbling at the edges of autonomy, freedom and human rights in Hong Kong. When Lam tried to push through a bill that would have allowed local authorities to extradite criminal suspects to China, the people knew what that meant. It would open the door to Beijing snapping up democracy advocates, dissidents and other critics. Justice in China is subservient to the regime and the ruling Communist Party. Hong Kong extradition bill: Hundreds of thousands join third huge protest in a week The wave of protests began just days after the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, when China\u2019s rulers cracked down on pro-democracy protests, killing hundreds and possibly thousands (according to Amnesty International and others) in the center of the capital. The protesters in Hong Kong are under no illusions about their foes. That makes their courage all the more inspiring. They know that China today is under the control of the most powerful and ruthless leader in decades in President Xi Jinping. Xi has assumed full control of the party. He has managed to eliminate the tradition of term limits. He could stay in power for the rest of his life. International human rights monitors say the rights situation has become far worse under his rule. The outlook, says Human Rights Watch, \u201cis grim.\u201d China\u2019s president has presided over the building of a network of internment camps filled with what the Defense Department has said is as many as three million ethnic-minority, mostly Uighur, Muslims in Xinjiang Province. The Chinese government calls the camps \u201ceducation training centers,\u201d part of a counter-terrorism campaign. Critics calls them concentration camps. Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong released from prison In the rest of China, citizens enjoy rising living standards, but no political freedoms, no free press, restricted access to the internet and continuous surveillance. Those who insist on criticizing the regime suffer terrible fates. Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo died while serving a prison sentence for demanding an end to one-party rule. The 1997 agreement is supposed to guarantee that Hong Kong residents, in contrast to the rest of the country, will enjoy freedom of the press, of expression and assembly, among others. But democratic freedoms have already been shrinking in the territory, along with the space for dissent. Beijing has been steadily capturing control of political levers.  Lam\u2019s undemocratic election in 2017 came as a sharp blow. The chief executive is chosen by an election committee that has come to be dominated by Beijing loyalists. Lam was viewed as Beijing\u2019s candidate, Beijing\u2019s \u201cpuppet,\u201d some called her. Now protesters are demanding she step down. Why Hong Kong protesters are outraged by extradition bill In the past year, a pro-independence political party was banned, an unprecedented move. Authorities claimed that party posed a \u201cthreat to national security,\u201d a charge critics say opened the door to other political constraints in the name of security. Also unprecedented was Beijing\u2019s barring two Hong Kong legislators from joining the legislature. The two, democratically elected, had refused to swear allegiance to China and held up a flag reading, \u201cHong Kong is not China.\u201d Separately, authorities refused to renew the visa of a Financial Times correspondent after he hosted a leading independence activist at the Foreign Correspondents Club despite protests from China\u2019s government. When China agreed to allow Hong Kong its freedom more than 20 years ago, it had much more to gain from preserving international standards there. Just after the handover, Hong Kong, a global financial center, accounted for 16% of China\u2019s GDP. If rule of law disappeared there, China stood to suffer painful economic losses. But China\u2019s booming economy means Hong Kong now accounts for barely 3% of China\u2019s GDP.  Beijing has much less to lose from cracking down. 'Delaying' extradition bill same as 'withdrawing', says pro-establishment HK lawmaker Despite the risk, the people of Hong Kong know their future is at stake, and they seem determined to safeguard their freedoms. The last time they demanded stronger democracy, in 2014, the so-called umbrella movement failed and many went to prison. This weekend, one of the leaders of that protest, Joshua Wong, was freed from prison and headed directly to the new demonstration, undeterred, demanding direct election of the chief executive, and other protections for the territory\u2019s fragile freedoms. He also asked that the US approve the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which puts the US on record supporting democracy, human rights, and rule of law in Hong Kong, and calls for sanctions if China curtails them. Members of Congress have just reintroduced the bill.  The path ahead for the people of Hong Kong is daunting. Amid the justified anxiety, they have shown extraordinary courage. After all, they\u2019ve seen the fate of others who dared to challenge Beijing. At a time when the US President seems sharply focused on trade with China, it\u2019s good to see Congress taking action to support Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, and its people\u2019s high-stakes bravery.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. The soothsayers brought the king bad news. Rival Joe Biden was leading President Donald Trump in key battleground states. After the press began to report the facts, Trump first tried to say the polls just didn\u2019t exist. When this claim was refuted, his campaign abruptly fired the pollsters. Welcome to the launch of the Trump re-election campaign, which promises more of the chaos we\u2019ve come to expect from the man in the Oval Office. If the past four years have taught the world anything, it\u2019s that it\u2019s never safe to assume that anything with Trump is simple and straightforward. His main talent involves ignoring facts, shaping a marketing message, and making sure he and his team stick to it. Trump asks Mulvaney to leave ABC interview for coughing Trump is a propagandist and he\u2019s really good at it. Hence his humiliation of his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney whom he scolded for coughing during an interview. True to his showman\u2019s style, after Mulvaney departed Trump did a new take for the camera, making the same point that had been interrupted by the hacking. As part of his method, Trump demands that those who serve as his chorus loyally repeat his claims and refuse to contradict him. In his world, people seem to always scramble to make him happy and the President\u2019s moods and his fantasies are the most important things. So it is that aides repeat the fiction that Trump was fully exonerated by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the 2016 election even though the opposite is true. Shakeup in the House of Trump The pollster purge followed a familiar pattern. The people who serve him deliver unsettling facts, which reporters also learn. Devoted to his image as a winner, Trump publicly refutes the truth. When this position become untenable, heads roll. These dismissals were couched in terms of campaign security. Someone had leaked news of the President\u2019s lagging performance and leakers won\u2019t be tolerated. Then, lo and behold, two of the fired pollsters are immediately hired by a pro-Trump campaign organization. The soft landings offered to the two pollsters will keep them in the pro-Trump camp, where they can be expected to please him by keeping their mouths shut about the President\u2019s possible weaknesses and stay on-message with the boss, parroting his version of reality no matter what the facts indicate. This is how a citizen of Trumpworld survives. No one hews to his own version of reality with more devotion than Donald Trump. He made this clear four years ago as he announced his candidacy with a disjointed and rambling talk seasoned with distortions and outright lies. He said the Mexican government was \u201csending\u201d immigrants who are rapists and murders and drug dealers to terrorize America. Unemployment was not 5.6% as reported by the government but \u201c18 to 20%\u201d and prisoners taken by the US in Afghanistan had been released and become fighters. Trump\u2019s claims about immigrants, unemployment, and the freed prisoners were all false and these distortions combined with his kitschy stagecraft \u2013 riding down to the crowd on a golden escalator, hiring extras to cheer \u2013 to make him seem like a cartoon figure. What Trump seemed to know, which others did not, was that his words would feel true to many Americans who disliked immigrants, were unsure about their jobs, and feared terrorists. He also understood that a big, bold, even cartoonish presentation might be required if he was to touch the emotions that would energize voters. He would delegitimize the fact-checking press as \u201cfake news,\u201d attack his opponents with childish nicknames, and degrade the campaign with lie upon lie. After Sarah Sanders, we need a real press secretary No presidential candidate in memory practiced incitement and demagoguery in the dangerous way that Trump used them in 2016. As he called for his crowd to meet protesters with violence and suggested his opponent be imprisoned, Trump alienated the majority of voters, who gave Hillary Clinton a substantial popular vote win. However, he cultivated just enough support in key states to win the Electoral College. Trump\u2019s success affirmed for him that his methods, borrowed from his life\u2019s work as a promoter and pitchman \u2013 were right. With re-election in mind, he made life so difficult for sober, fact-based realists like Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that they fled his administration. Left behind is a cadre of yes-men and yes-women whose preoccupation must be to stay aligned with the boss. What the boss must want now is to be re-elected. This desire doesn\u2019t seem to be based on his drive to accomplish a big goal \u2013 can you name one? \u2013 or serve the country in some special way. If these were foremost in his mind he would have made it clear. He is far more likely to be driven by the existential dread of defeat and joining the tiny list of presidents who have been denied a second term. These men are losers in his eyes, and there\u2019s nothing Trump hates more than losing.  Trump\u2019s formal re-election campaign launch, set for Tuesday night in Orlando, Florida, will be yet another theatrical occasion. No one should doubt that it will be accomplished with impressive lighting and stage sets. If there\u2019s no golden escalator available Trump will find some other way to make the moment visually compelling, and his rhetoric will likely be more fiery than factual, more petulant than presidential. How do we know that Trump will give us the same kind of performance he offered in 2016? Consider that he has continued to hold the same kind of rallies and deliver the same kind of talk he offered back then and you know what\u2019s coming next. Heedless of the negative side effects including the division and fear he sows, Trump knows no other way. He will be hyper-partisan and hyperbolic and he will expect the mesmerizing magic to work again.",

If there is one thing that regularly brings our country together, it\u2019s our hatred of Washington. Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat or a fake Republican pretending to be one for your job security, odds are you have at times harbored some level of dislike for the nation\u2019s capital. But the truth is, if you hate Washington, DC, the thing you actually hate is Washington \u2013 and, most likely, you don\u2019t know much about DC. When I was in town, folks who actually live there \u2013 as in, not the politicians who just work there \u2013 told me they refer to Capitol Hill as Washington and everything else as DC. Hating Washington has been a thing since we decided to put the capital there in 1790: It was too far south for the North and too far north for the South. And because our Founding Fathers didn\u2019t want the nation\u2019s capital to be under the sway of the state it was located in, they decided it would remain under the rule of the federal government \u2013 which sounds fine, unless you live there. Since Washington isn\u2019t in a state, it can\u2019t really govern itself. The city does have a delegate in Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, but although she can serve on committees, she cannot vote on final passage of any legislation. This is weird, especially when you consider that DC is the capital of a country whose whole existence is based on self-governance. But as quiet as it\u2019s kept, Washington is not just the capital of the United States. It\u2019s more like a tale of two cities \u2013 and this Sunday on \u201cUnited Shades of America,\u201d I learn what that\u2019s like for the people who just happen to live in the District. This kid says he felt safer when Barack Obama was President Where Washington is a scene that has long been and is still mostly dominated by white men, DC is one of America\u2019s great black cities \u2013 so black it\u2019s called Chocolate City. (Or at least they used to call it that. Gentrification has some of the people I talked to people calling it \u201cMilk Chocolate City\u201d or \u201cReese\u2019s Pieces City.\u201d) DC has had decades of black leadership. And no matter who is in charge over on the Hill, DC is a reliable bright blue dot on the electoral map. It is a city that regularly leads the rest of the country on lefty issues like gun control, marriage equality, and legalization of marijuana. Or at least it tries to lead the nation. Since DC isn\u2019t a part of a state or its own state, when the District decides to vote for something like legalized marijuana or banning handguns, the federal government often steps in and says not so fast. As one of the guests on the show, Howard University professor Dr. Greg Carr tells me on Sunday\u2019s episode, \u201cDC has more in common with Guam and Puerto Rico. It\u2019s an occupied territory.\u201d W. Kamau Bell: Hmong-Americans redefined patriotism before my eyes Sit with that for a little bit in the so-called land of the free. Many of the DC residents I talked to discussed how their sense of occupation is connected to race. During the Civil War and Reconstruction, more than 25,000 formerly enslaved Africans moved to town. Back then, DC was mostly pro-Union, and it had a burgeoning infrastructure of black education, small businesses and churches that were centers for social justice. But while DC residents empowered themselves locally, it\u2019s always been an uphill battle with the federal government. They weren\u2019t even allowed to vote in the presidential election until 1961, the same year we first put a man in space. My goal this episode was to talk to as many people off the Hill as I could to get a feel for the real DC. I started at one of my favorite spots in the city, Calabash Tea & Cafe, which is owned by my friend Sunyatta Amen. It\u2019s right around the corner from Howard University, so it\u2019s a regular hangout for students and professors. That\u2019s where I met Professor Carr, and it was the first of many times that week that I heard about the man DC calls \u201cThe Mayor For Life,\u201d Marion Barry. April Ryan describes the day she asked President Trump if he is racist He wasn\u2019t actually the mayor for life, but he was DC\u2019s mayor multiple times across many years with a break in the middle. That break is why I\u2019m guessing that, for many people who may only have heard the story of him getting caught smoking crack, he\u2019s just the punchline to a joke. But what\u2019s less known is that he\u2019s also a hero to the city. In the 1960s he was a civil rights leader who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. In the 1970s he an architect of the Home Rule Act, which meant there could actually be a mayor in DC. As mayor, he got more black police officers on the force and launched the Summer Youth Program, which gave many DC residents their very first jobs. After tea, I went to Lee\u2019s Flower and Card Shop, a community hub that has the laughter and conversation of a barber shop. It\u2019s one of DC\u2019s oldest black-owned businesses and employs many local residents. When I was there I quipped that there were more black women working there than in the Trump administration. They laughed. I wasn\u2019t really kidding. I also talked to people in DC who have seen what is going on over on Capitol Hill and have felt inspired to go to do something about it. That included Naomi Wadler, an 11-year-old girl who spoke at The March For Life rally held after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and activist and mom Kristin Mink, who went viral for confronting the embattled then-head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who seemed to specialize in doing everything in his tenure except protecting the environment. Why DC residents don't have equal voting rights I met up with DC legends Henry Rollins and Trouble Funk, the band that helped pioneer the DC area\u2019s beloved genre, go-go music. I was also honored to meet with longtime White House correspondent and Black Twitter doyenne April Ryan. Ryan was born and raised in Baltimore, not that far from DC, and she talked about how she never could have imagined her life as a White House reporter. I even embedded my audition to be the new host of \u201cKids Say The Darnedest Things About Our Crumbling Democracy\u201d in this episode by talking to a bunch of fifth graders at Oyster-Adams Bilingual School. Oyster-Adams is a public school that in addition to the regular stuff teaches English, Spanish and eventually Mandarin to its students. It\u2019s a diverse school, and serves a portion of DC\u2019s large Salvadoran community. The kids I met with all expressed their love of DC and their fear of what is going on in Washington. Each of them spoke more eloquently and intelligently than anything we have had coming out of the Oval Office since January 17, 2017. But before you think my visit was too one-sided, I also met with Prentice Wolf, a black woman who, as you can tell from her red MAGA hat, ain\u2019t with her. She talked of her discomfort with letting people know she\u2019s a Trump supporter in such a bright blue city. DC is a beautiful place, a city with a proud black history when it wasn\u2019t easy to be black and proud, and a city that has consistently turned out some of the nation\u2019s best artists and thought leaders. And many of those people also have a real problem with Washington, because Washington won\u2019t let DC be DC: a diverse place with progressive politics and a history of fighting for the voices of the unheard. Many feel like they are being ruled instead of governed, and that is especially clear during the Trump era.  Washington will probably in some ways always be a mess, but that\u2019s not DC\u2019s fault. And whether you\u2019re on the left or the right, you have to support a city being allowed to decide what\u2019s good for itself. Let DC be DC.",

She is also completing a doctorate in Renaissance literature. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. This weekend, all eyes were on a big march in Washington, DC. But it wasn\u2019t Saturday\u2019s Women\u2019s March \u2013 mired in controversy and absent some major figures \u2013 which grabbed all the headlines. Instead, we\u2019ve been treated to three days of fury as the whirlwind of Twitter swirled around an encounter between teenage boys attending Friday\u2019s March for Life and a Native American army veteran, Nathan Phillips, marching at the Indigenous Peoples March. Given the divisive nature of this year\u2019s Women\u2019s March, one suspects the organizers are enjoying a sigh of relief. The video footage that caught boys from Covington Catholic High School, as they faced off with Phillips and members of the Hebrew Israelites, has proved a national Rorschach test. (The Hebrew Israelites are a group that believes some black Americans are the descendants of an ancient Israelite tribe and which the Village Voice once described as \u201cNew York\u2019s most obnoxious prophets.\u201d) When the first footage hit Twitter, it seemed to show a young, white, MAGA-hatted boy smirking in the face of a Native elder, as his comrades chanted aggressively. The left raced to condemn the boy and his classmates. Then, further footage demonstrated that the boys had been provoked by the black activists calling them \u201ccrackers\u201d and \u201cincest children,\u201d alongside homophobic slurs. One of the young men involved made a statement saying his classmates had only chanted their high school \u201cspirit chants\u201d in response. The pendulum of public outrage, with which we should all now be wearily familiar, swung back. Now it was the right\u2019s turn to condemn the left as the agents of mob mentality and group think. When you watch any of the footage of this incident \u2013 even the \u201cexonerating\u201d footage \u2013 what you\u2019re looking at is three social groups who have grown up under such alienated circumstances that they have no road map for encountering the other. And as the viewers, we too often see what we want to see. To many white eyes, the lengthiest video footage shows that the Covington school boys were simply victims of the black men who started the conflict. But as Issac Bailey has written elsewhere for CNN, to many African-Americans the fact that these boys wore Donald Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again hats was in itself a statement of allegiance to \u201ca President who won his office by openly spouting bigoted rhetoric.\u201d The mother of one of the students rightly pointed out that her son had been goaded. But she also described the aggressors as \u201cblack Muslims,\u201d which suggests she comes from a household quick to reach for a clich\u00e9d black bogeyman. Why Trump's MAGA hats have become a potent symbol of racism The same culture of alienation is responsible for much of the controversy surrounding the Women\u2019s March. Over the last year, it has become abundantly clear that key organizers of the movement have repeatedly demeaned Jewish women and peddled openly anti-Semitic stereotypes. Tamika Mallory and other co-organizers have denied these reports, published in Tablet in December 2018, but frankly, we should have acknowledged that the rot had set in long before that. The brilliant New York Times editor Bari Weiss was unreasonably vilified back in 2017 when she pointed out Women\u2019s March leader Linda Sarsour\u2019s long history of apologism for political Islamism, including tweets expressing a violent fantasy about Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a survivor of female genital mutilation who has embraced secularism. In both Britain and America, the left\u2019s desire to protect Muslims from prejudice has long since bled into an acceptance of political Islamism\u2019s worst tendencies toward anti-Semitism and misogyny. Meanwhile, Women\u2019s March leader Tamika Mallory, a black woman, has been criticized for her political closeness to the African-American religious leader Louis Farrakhan, whose October description of Jewish people as \u201ctermites\u201d is only the latest in a career of anti-Semitic rhetoric. In November 2018, the Women\u2019s March\u2019s collective leadership finally distanced itself from Farrakhan and \u201creject[ed] anti-Semitism in all its forms,\u201d but it saved its real condemnation for \u201cmany on the right\u201d seeking to \u201cdivide and undermine us.\u201d Since then, Mallory has repeated her admiration for Farrakhan. But as the biracial black and Jewish writer Adam Serwer points out, Mallory herself knew few Jewish people growing up in Harlem, in a culture where Farrakhan was credited with providing community policing. In other communities, the sound of Jewish people being called \u201ctermites\u201d triggers an intergenerational PTSD. There are Jewish women who still live with the loss of an uncle or grandparent they might have known, if the dehumanizing language of Der St\u00fcrmer had not led to the ovens of Auschwitz. Six such victims were only just given a proper burial this week in London. Clearly, Sarsour and Mallory have failed to empathize with these women. One hopes that if Mallory had grown up in a world where African-Americans and Jews were more frequently integrated, she might have understood. Women's March is losing its way The Women\u2019s March is a troubled movement, not only in the US, but also amongst its global partners. Here in London, the local organizers of Saturday\u2019s march dedicated the event to the socialist suffragist Rose Schneiderman and declared it in opposition to both Brexit and the \u201causterity\u201d policies of the Conservative government. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that libertarian and conservative leaning women, including myself, stayed away. The London event has also been riven with infighting over the very definition of womanhood. This Monday, the organization\u2019s Twitter account managed to offend many of us by referring to pioneering female members of parliament as \u201cmenstruators\u201d rather than \u201cwomen.\u201d They later deleted the tweet and offered a statement \u201cclarifying\u201d their position on the term and \u201creiterat[ing] that we are a fully inclusive, intersectional feminist movement.\u201d At the first two Women\u2019s Marches, many women attending wore \u201cpussy hats\u201d to protest the election of a US President who had boasted of grabbing women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d A report on transphobia by the influential queer newspaper Pink News later termed these hats, with their focus on women\u2019s biological experience, \u201cexclusionary pussy hats.\u201d In both Britain and America, some black women have also objected to them as exclusionary. Perhaps all protest movements are always doomed to splinter and split.  But one can\u2019t help but feel that all of the protest dramas this week owed something to the increasingly siloed nature of our different communities. Neighborhoods which bus their teenage students to pro-life marches aren\u2019t doing much to encourage us all to think for ourselves, but neither are twitchy fingered social justice warriors. Mallory and Sarsour would do well to understand that they don\u2019t come from the only communities that have experienced persecution. Britain\u2019s Women\u2019s March is already, like so many such movements, firmly in the hands of those who imagine they have a monopoly on virtue.  There is one last social irony. In the era of Donald Trump, this weekend\u2019s headlines were supposed to be all about the power of women to confront toxic masculinity. Many of the women who attended the March for Life did so carrying babies and talking reverently of motherhood \u2013 they, like their counterparts at the Women\u2019s March, often frame their political arguments in the language of female virtue. Yet it was two gangs of young men whose posturing and pack standoff, however it was instigated, stole the show. While the women were falling out with each other, the boys were showing that some traditional gender roles haven\u2019t changed a bit.",

Protests in Hong Kong have been\u00a0escalating for five months now,\u00a0and\u00a0several serious incidents this weekend may mark a\u00a0new boiling point. A\u00a0traffic police officer shot a 21-year-old protester in the torso, sparking renewed outrage and violence. (Police say the protester is expected to survive.) Hours after the shooting, a\u00a0man who confronted a group of pro-democracy protesters was doused in a flammable liquid and set alight. Amid the violence, a police officer appeared to drive his motorcycle into a crowd\u00a0and has been suspended by the force. All of this escalating unrest follows the death of a 22-year-old student on Friday, who passed away after falling from a parking garage during a demonstration. The surge in violence has\u00a0taken a toll on the economy:\u00a0Hong Kong stocks suffered their worst day in more than three months on Monday. Could this be the biggest week yet for the House impeachment investigation? Those closed-door testimonies are about to become public, and Democrats will trot out a stable of\u00a0career State Department employees who will testify under oath to things they\u2019ve already talked about in private. On the docket:\u00a0Bill Taylor, still the top State Department official in Ukraine;\u00a0US Diplomat George Kent;\u00a0and former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Not scheduled to appear: The unknown whistleblower whose alarm uncovered Trump\u2019s alleged effort to use financial aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip to further his own political interests. Republican leaders like\u00a0Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham want the whistleblower to come forward and testify. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says the whistleblower\u2019s claims have\u00a0been corroborated, so an appearance would be redundant. More than 70 dangerous bushfires are burning across the Australian state of New South Wales today, threatening thousands of people and bringing a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire threat level to the Sydney region. It\u2019s the\u00a0worst threat level ever issued for Sydney under the current system, which was introduced in 2009. At least three people have died as a result of the blazes, and more than 100 homes have been lost. Strong winds, high temperatures and low humidity in the area have increased fire worries, and the state\u00a0is under a seven-day state of emergency.\u00a0While\u00a0Sydney, with its population of 4.6 million people,\u00a0is of particular concern, fire officials pointed out the greatest fire risk lies in rural areas outside the city center.\u00a0The cloud of smoke can be seen as far away as New Zealand. Bolivian President Evo Morales and Vice President \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera resigned yesterday amid growing outrage after an international audit found the results of last month\u2019s general election could not be validated because of \u201cserious irregularities.\u201d The October elections sparked protests across the country. Thousands of demonstrators accused electoral authorities of manipulating the vote count in favor of Morales, the country\u2019s longtime socialist leader who was seeking his fourth term. Now that Morales is out, even more uncertainty is coming down the road as Bolivians must go back to the polls for a new general election. Morales was president for 14 years, and there isn\u2019t a clear successor to his administration. Winter is DEFINITELY here. The US is in for a record-breaking Arctic blast this week that could cause temperatures in some part of the country\u00a0to plummet to 30 degrees below average. The National Weather Service predicts that more than 200 record lows could be tied or set from Monday to Wednesday.

            "article_content": "House Democrats are crossing a somber point of no political return as they roll out articles of impeachment Tuesday accusing President Donald Trump of abusing power and obstructing Congress. The momentous step toward making Trump only the third president to be formally impeached in nearly two-and-a-half centuries of US history comes in a tumultuous third year of his term and only 11 months before the next general election. \u201cToday, in service to our duty to the Constitution and to our country, the House Committee on the Judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment, charging the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, with committing high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said at a news conference, formally unveiling the two articles against Trump. Democrats have accused the President of abusing his power by withholding nearly $400 million in US military aid to Ukraine and the prospect of a visit to the Oval Office by new President Volodymyr Zelensky in order to coerce the former Soviet state into investigating potential 2020 foe Joe Biden. Such conduct, they say, is worthy of impeachment because it amounts to bribery, puts Trump\u2019s own political goals ahead of America\u2019s national interests and effectively invited a foreign power to interfere in a US election. Democrats to lay out articles of impeachment on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on Tuesday \u201cThe scheme by President Trump was so brazen, so clear, supported by documents, actions, sworn testimony, uncontradicted contemporaneous records that it\u2019s hard to imagine that anybody could dispute those acts, let alone argue that that conduct does not constitute an impeachable offense or offenses,\u201d said Barry Berke, presenting the case against Trump for the Democrats in a Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday. Republicans have struggled to counter the facts laid out by witnesses drawn from ranks of foreign policy and military officers. But they deny Trump did anything wrong at all, let alone anything that reaches the level of impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. A hoax,\u201d the President said at the White House on Monday, without bothering to counter any of the evidence. The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, meanwhile accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of rushing to impeachment \u2013 with expectations that Democrats will hold a full House vote on the issue next week. \u201cThe speaker of the House after hearing one day of testimony in the Judiciary Committee, said, \u2018Go write articles.\u2019 Facts be damned,\u201d Collins said. Democrats counter that Trump has denied more than 70 requests for evidence and blocked testimony from key officials, giving them no choice but to declare that he obstructed Congress in its lawful oversight function. They have elected not to launch legal challenges to compel testimony that could drag on for months. The prospect of impeachment represents the most serious political reverse yet for Trump. Yet given his habit of skipping past political scandals \u2013 again on display Monday as the Justice Department inspector general debunked his conspiracy theories about the FBI \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely he will rein in his convention-busting behavior. One day, Trump may pay a price for his constant attempts to test the limits of his power, for lying about proven facts at a historic clip and ignoring the convention of his office. Such a reckoning could come at the next election. But such has been Trump\u2019s success in reshaping the narrative of the scandals besetting his presidency, it\u2019s no sure thing that voters who propelled his victory will side with the Democrats. It may be that only history can record a damning verdict against the President \u2013 though for future generations, the whirl of confusion on days like Monday will be difficult to understand. Takeaways from the inspector general's report into the FBI's Russia investigation For now, the President is pioneering a new theory of political office \u2013 if you never admit to being caught in the act, it\u2019s very hard for adversaries to make you pay the consequences. It\u2019s an extension of Trump\u2019s lifelong mantra to never admit wrongdoing and never apologize that sustained him through all kind of scrapes in the rough-knocks world of business. How else to explain his judgment that the rough log of a smoking gun call with Ukraine\u2019s President in which he is shown as asking for a quid pro quo \u201cfavor\u201d is \u201cperfect\u201d? Of course, within two weeks, Trump is likely to be only the third American president to be impeached \u2013 a black mark that is certain to form the first line of his eventual obituary. But he\u2019s unlikely to hold his head in shame. In fact, he\u2019s bound to tout almost certain survival in a Senate trial as the ultimate triumph over a political swamp the never wanted him as President and has tried to topple him ever since. Trump\u2019s 24-hour a day assault of conspiracy theories, alternative facts and political attacks on his opponents has left the Washington system struggling to cope. It\u2019s as if he has worked out that as long as his incessant assault on the senses keeps gathering pace, no one will be able to keep up with the magnitude of his malfeasance. Of course, Trump could not do it alone. An underappreciated wrinkle of Trump\u2019s political genius is his ability to assemble an uber loyal band of sidekicks and henchmen willing to harness their reputations to his survival. His band of brothers reflect his domination of the Republican Party and his success in harnessing his connection with the grassroots as a lever to control lawmakers in Washington. Now that the President has dispensed with the \u201cadults\u201d \u2013 military, national security and political professionals once seen as restraints on his wildest instincts \u2013 he\u2019s left with the loyalists who will fight alongside him whatever happens. Trump\u2019s defenders in Washington seem certain to frustrate Democrats\u2019 hopes of ousting him from office however incriminating the evidence. Barr slams FBI as he and Durham contradict watchdog Once again Monday, Attorney General William Barr played the role as chief spinmeister to redirect a narrative that\u2019s damaging to the President \u2013 just as he did when creating an inaccurate interpretation of the Mueller report that shielded Trump. Barr rejected the finding of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz that the FBI showed no political bias in opening a probe into his 2016 campaign\u2019s links with Russia. In effect, the report exonerated Trump\u2019s enemies, such as former FBI chief James Comey, from the President\u2019s claim that they conspired against him. It also debunked the idea that the probe was opened based on findings of the Steele Dossier, a document funded partly by Democrats that said Trump was compromised by Russia. Barr chose to focus on critiques in the report that FBI lawyers made errors in filing applications to a special court for wiretaps on former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. \u201cThe inspector general\u2019s report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation of a US presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,\u201d Barr said. Even more incredibly, Barr enlisted the prosecutor that he has asked to look at similar material, John Durham, to put out his own statement registering disagreement with Horowitz. The move raised immediate doubts about Durham\u2019s independence and suggested that Barr is leaning on his investigation to produce a finding more palatable to the President. It also established a new political narrative for Trump\u2019s propagandists in conservative media \u2013 that the watchdog report is merely a distraction and it\u2019s the Durham report that really matters. It would not be the first time that Barr has seemed to act more as Trump\u2019s lawyer than the independent figurehead of US justice \u2013 a role to some extent walled off from the White House \u2013 that the attorney general is traditionally seen to occupy. Takeaways from the House's impeachment hearing Barr was not the only Trump lieutenant who rode to the President\u2019s defense on Friday. The President\u2019s allies in the House repeatedly disrupted the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee as it plowed through damning facts of Trump\u2019s conduct. \u201cThey can\u2019t get over the fact that Donald Trump is the President of the United States and they don\u2019t have a candidate that they think can beat him. It\u2019s all political,\u201d said Collins, the panel\u2019s top Republican. Republicans spent most of the day ignoring the Democratic mound of evidence that Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a political rival: Biden. They instead tried to establish the obvious fact that Ukraine was a corrupt country \u2013 and that Trump was therefore justified in withholding $400 million in military aid and an Oval Office visit from the Ukrainian President. At one point, Republican counsel Steve Castor tried to argue that the impeachment charges were moot since Biden \u2013 the nationwide Democratic front-runner \u2013 wasn\u2019t a true rival for Trump. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t agree with that \u2026 it\u2019s too early,\u201d Castor said. Trump\u2019s almost mystical capacity to enlist Republican supporters was also at work on Sunday when his former bitter rival went on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to defend the President. Ted Cruz, a Russia hawk, insisted that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election \u2013 thereby offering Trump a rationale for seeking investigations from Zelensky. \u201cHere\u2019s the game the media is playing: because Russia interfered, the media pretends nobody else did. Ukraine blatantly interfered in our election,\u201d Cruz said. The Texas senator, however, was basing his comparison largely on newspaper columns by Ukrainian officials and public criticisms of Trump. Such \u201cmeddling\u201d falls far short of the sophisticated intelligence, computer hacking and misinformation campaign mounted by Russia to help win Trump election \u2013 as described by former special counsel Robert Mueller in his report.

            "article_content": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday appointed Atlanta businesswoman Kelly Loeffler to take over the seat of retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson. Kemp, a Republican, had been pressed by President Donald Trump to appoint Rep. Doug Collins, CNN previously reported, but selected Loeffler in a rare act of defiance against Trump by a member of his own party. Isakson is retiring on December 31 due to health concerns. An executive at a commodities trading firm in Atlanta and the co-owner of the WNBA\u2019s Atlanta Dream, Loeffler, 49, had considered running for Senate in 2014. During Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Loeffler, a prominent Republican donor, introduced herself as \u201ca lifelong conservative. Pro-Second Amendment. Pro-military. Pro-wall. And pro-Trump.\u201d Isakson calls for true bipartisanship and praises colleagues on both sides of the aisle in farewell speech She confirmed Wednesday that she will be running to retain her seat in November. Kemp rallied behind his pick during his announcement, comparing Loeffler to Ivanka Trump, the President\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, as \u201ca savvy businesswoman,\u201d and describing her a \u201cpolitical outsider\u201d who \u201cknows that we need to drain the swamp.\u201d Though Trump wanted the governor to pick Collins for the seat, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and fierce defender of the President, indicated his support for Loeffler on Tuesday, saying she would be a \u201cterrific\u201d choice for the seat. The powerful National Republican Senatorial Committee also plans to support her in next year\u2019s election, a source familiar with the matter has told CNN. The Democratic Party of Georgia blasted Kemp\u2019s decision to pick Loeffler on Wednesday, with its chairwoman, Nikema Williams, saying in a statement that Loeffler \u201chas already made it clear that she will not be an independent voice for our state, and instead will fall in line with Donald Trump\u201d and other Republicans. \u201cToday\u2019s appointment showcases exactly where Brian Kemp\u2019s and Georgia Republicans\u2019 priorities lie: with their own special interests, instead of the people of Georgia,\u201d Williams said.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has decried the impeachment inquiry as a hoax and a scam run by Democratic \u201cmaniacs,\u201d but he now faces a critical choice: whether to legitimize the proceedings by allowing his lawyers to participate or refuse to take part in an inquiry he says is a sham. The White House has been tight-lipped as it weighs the risks and potential reward of intervening in the House proceedings. House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who will oversee the next phase of the impeachment inquiry in hearings that begin next week, told the White House on Friday that it must give a definitive answer on whether it will participate by 5 p.m. on December 6. Reminding the President of the stakes, Nadler wrote in his Friday letter that the House Intelligence Committee is preparing its report that will describe \u201c\u2018a months-long effort in which President Trump again sought foreign interference in our elections for his personal and political benefit at the expense of our national interest\u2019\u201d and engaged in \u201can unprecedented campaign of obstruction in an effort to prevent the Committees from obtaining documentary evidence and testimony.\u201d That report from the House Intelligence Committee is due as early as next week \u2013 a chance for Democrats to make a cogent case against the President after weeks of testimony and document collection. Nadler has offered the White House the chance to defend the President\u2019s conduct head on. It could attempt to sway public opinion by questioning witnesses, introducing its own witnesses \u2013 if approved by the chairman, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California \u2013 and giving a concluding presentation that would offer Americans a succinct argument for Trump\u2019s side. That opportunity to shape the narrative is especially significant because the country is so divided on the question of impeachment. The latest CNN poll found that 50% of Americans say the President should be impeached or removed from office, a number that remains unchanged from October, despite the weeks-long attempt by Democrats to present an airtight case of presidential wrongdoing. Beneath those static topline numbers, however, a stunning 61% of women favored impeachment and removal of the President, compared with 40% of men. Presenting a coherent narrative about why Democrats are wrong during the upcoming impeachment proceedings could be critical for Trump if he wants to win back support of some of those women. (In 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Trump among women by 54% to 41%). Women will compose a majority of the electorate next year, and the 2018 midterm election results showed that he is particularly struggling with women who live in the suburban districts that have been key battlegrounds in swing states and districts. A coordinated White House strategy could also be more effective than the scattershot approach of Republican members of Congress, some of whom did their best to confuse the public during the Intelligence Committee hearings by raising debunked conspiracy theories and pushing the unfounded allegation that Ukraine had interfered in US elections, rather than Russia. Trump and his Republican colleagues in the House have complained vociferously about the House Intelligence Committee rules because they were excluded from those hearings. Before the hearings began, Trump tweeted: \u201cIt was just explained to me that for next weeks Fake Hearing (trial) in the House, as they interview Never Trumpers and others, I get NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS. It is a Pelosi, Schiff, Scam against the Republican Party and me. This Witch Hunt should not be allowed to proceed!\u201d In an Oct. 8 letter to House Democratic leaders, the President\u2019s Counsel Pat Cipollone charged that they had designed their inquiry in a way that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process. \u201cYou have denied the President the right to cross-examine witnesses, to call witnesses, to receive transcripts of testimony, to have access to evidence, to have counsel present, and many other basic rights guaranteed to all Americans.\u201d White House lawyers could potentially offer Americans alternative theories for the President\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. They could bring in their own witnesses to better explain why nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine was withheld; and they could create enough doubt about the President\u2019s intentions to give a few swing-district Democrats pause before the full House votes on impeachment. But they also would be playing that game under Democratic rules. Already the timing of the hearings conflicts with the President\u2019s schedule. One administration official told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Friday not to expect Trump to participate in Wednesday\u2019s House Judiciary hearing since the commander in chief will be in London that day attending the NATO summit. \u201cKind of hard when Nadler scheduled his hearing when the President is in London,\u201d the official told Acosta. \u201cHe [Nadler] has the audacity to ask whether the President will attend.\u201d Overall the White House has not decided whether to have its attorneys at the hearing: \u201cThe letter is being reviewed and options are under consideration,\u201d the official told Acosta on Friday. Using his bully pulpit and his Twitter account, Trump has succeeded in convincing most Republicans that the Democrats have overreached in their zealous pursuit of criminality by the President. Even after a tremendous effort by the Democrats to convince Americans that Trump abused his power in pursuit of a political favor, the President\u2019s approval numbers are steady at 42%, and CNN\u2019s new poll found that only 10% of Republicans favor impeachment and removal (up from 6% in October). Trump adopted a new line of defense this week to try to distance himself from maneuverings in Ukraine by telling conservative talk radio host Bill O\u2019Reilly that he had no idea what his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was doing in Ukraine. Other members of Trump\u2019s team, including Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, have testified that Giuliani was the point man arranging a quid pro quo of a White House meeting with Trump for Ukraine\u2019s President in exchange for the Ukrainian President publicly announcing an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. There is another compelling reason why Trump and his lawyers might skip the House Judiciary proceedings, and that is because if the House impeaches him, the trial will then start in the Senate \u2013 which is friendlier territory. Once the inquiry moves to the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, will be steering the process, giving the White House more control. Last week, McConnell\u2019s deputies \u2013 including Mike Lee of Utah, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas \u2013 met with Cipollone to begin discussing the framework of the trial if the House impeaches Trump, which it is expected to do by Dec. 25. In that early meeting, a source told CNN, the leaders talked about allowing Democrats to lay out their case over a two-week period before Republicans make a move to dismiss it. But those talks are still in early days. Moreover, McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, are expected to attempt to negotiate a bipartisan resolution setting rules and procedures for the Senate trial. It\u2019s hard to know what that trial would look like, but the White House clearly may look more favorably on an arena where it could lay out its case without being forced to abide by the enemy\u2019s rules.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s Impeachment Watch newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Happy Thanksgiving! You probably don\u2019t want to talk politics with your Uncle Al, but it\u2019s going to come up. A CNN poll this week found that about 4 in 10 Americans are paying very close attention to the impeachment proceedings \u2013 but almost everyone has an opinion about it. Here\u2019s what you need to know about impeachment to not sound like a stuffed turkey in front of your family and friends. Yes, probably \u2013 but that\u2019s not the same as being removed from office. Here\u2019s how it all works. It\u2019s clear that the Democrats who control the House believe they have the votes to impeach President Donald Trump. He\u2019d be only the third president in history to suffer that indignity after Bill Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. Richard Nixon resigned rather than be impeached in 1974, but he did so only when Republican senators made clear they\u2019d also vote to remove him from office. Trump faces no such insurrection yet. Long story short: A vote might happen by Christmas. After two weeks of public hearings, Democrats are spending this holiday week writing up a report on what we learned from the hearings and they\u2019re also starting to craft articles of impeachment, the official accusations they\u2019ll vote on. That will take a little time, but the House Judiciary Committee has already scheduled procedural hearings starting the first week of December. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening behind the scenes this week. Impeaching a President only takes a majority vote in the House. Democrats have a majority in the House and then some. The current breakdown is 233 Democrats to 197 Republicans with one independent \u2013 that\u2019s Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the Republican Party earlier this year because of his opposition to Trump and his support for impeachment proceedings. So Democrats can lose 18 of their own members and still have the votes to impeach Trump. According to the Constitution, the the Senate conducts a trial to decide if an impeached President should be removed from office. But while a simple majority can impeach a President in the House, it takes a supermajority in the Senate \u2013 67 of 100 members \u2013 to remove an impeached President from office. Republicans hold a majority in the Senate of 53-45, though two independents almost always side with Democrats. (Those would be Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders and Maine\u2019s Angus King.) The final math: 20 Republicans would have to cross the aisle to vote to remove Trump from office. Exactly zero Republican senators have sounded like they\u2019re anywhere close to turning on him. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has committed to holding a trial if the House votes to impeach. \u201cWe will take it up, because we have no choice,\u201d he said Monday. That\u2019s a great question. It has a number of answers. First, it\u2019s clear that the base of Democratic voters is pretty insistent that the party do this. Democrats want those voters to show up in November. But perhaps more importantly, they think Trump\u2019s behavior demands it. \u201cI want it on the record that the House of Representatives did their job and they told this President and any president coming behind him that this is unacceptable behavior and under our Constitution, we will not allow it,\u201d Michigan Democratic Rep. Brenda Lawrence said earlier this week. The short version is that he appears to have used the promise of aid \u2013 paid for with US tax dollars \u2013 as leverage to force a foreign country to do him a political favor. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky wanted two things from Trump \u2013 a meeting at the White House to give him status on the world stage and money to help the Ukrainian military in its standoff with Russia. Trump or his top aides put a hold on money Congress had appropriated to help Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russian-backed separatists. And he appears to have done it with the express purpose of forcing Ukraine to investigate a conspiracy theory he has about Russian interference in 2016 and also the Bidens. Here\u2019s a longer look at the arguments for and against impeaching Trump. The military aid to Ukraine is important because a lot of Western countries see Ukraine as a bulwark standing between Russia and the West. In 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine since the fall of the Soviet Union. You don\u2019t really think of countries invading each other these days, but Russia did that to part of Ukraine not that long ago. And more to the point: a lot of what Trump does in foreign policy seems to benefit Vladimir Putin, the Russian President. Here\u2019s a CNN report from the front lines of that war in Ukraine. Again, Trump has adopted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind meddling in the 2016 election. This conspiracy theory gets really complicated, and Trump uses the confusion to his advantage. Here\u2019s a fact check of the very many misleading things Trump has about Ukraine. The idea of Ukrainian meddling has also been debunked, most recently by witnesses testifying in the impeachment proceedings. Read what they said here. The core of the case against Trump is a July 25 phone call he had with Zelensky. On that call, Trump never issued an ultimatum, but after Zelensky talked about missiles Ukraine needed, Trump asked him for the favor of investigating his theory about 2016 meddling, and also to look in to the Bidens. Trump says his call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect.\u201d You can judge for yourself by reading the transcript here. In September, when this all came out, Trump said the aid was held up to pressure European allies into giving more to Ukraine. But that defense has been undermined, most notably by Office of Management and Budget official Mark Sandy, who testified that he never heard that explanation until September. Read his testimony here. It became clear in September that aid to Ukraine had been held up. Then, on September 9, Congress was notified that a whistleblower had filed a complaint against Trump. The whistleblower report is still a really important document. Here\u2019s an annotated version of it. On September 11, the hold on the Ukraine aid was lifted \u2013 though the whistleblower complaint itself wasn\u2019t delivered to Congress until September 25. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump knew about the whistleblower complaint when he released the aid. Trump\u2019s political appointees, with one exception, have all refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. And the State Department, Pentagon and Office of Management and Budget have all declined to provide documents about how and when military aid was held up. But impeachment investigators have deposed 17 people \u2013 most of them professional State Department diplomats, National Security Council experts and a Lt. Col. in the US Army \u2013 and conducted two weeks of public hearings with a lot of those same witnesses. Use our tracker to see who\u2019s testified. We learned a lot in those two weeks. Everything from how Trump built a shadow foreign policy with Giuliani that led to the recall of an ambassador to the concerns that were raised in real time about his call with Zelensky by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and the concerns that were raised about the holdup in the aid by Bill Taylor, now the top US official in Ukraine. Fiona Hill, a former NSC staffer, distilled everything down perfectly when she said it dawned on her during the hearings that she and others were pursuing national security foreign policy while Giuliani and Sondland had been dispatched on Trump\u2019s \u201cdomestic political errand.\u201d Here\u2019s a roundup of the best moments from the hearings. Because Trump has decided not to cooperate with the inquiry and is making a claim of \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d in the courts, we haven\u2019t heard from his closest allies and they probably have the most to say. For instance, Vice President Mike Pence met with Zelensky when Trump couldn\u2019t. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the call when Trump talked to Zelensky and he was in contact with Giuliani about the Ukraine conspiracy theories last Spring. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was involved in holding up the aid to Ukraine before Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. White House and National Security Council lawyers made the decision to put the call into a more restricted server, potentially trying to hide it from the public. A federal judge this week rejected the \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d argument. \u201cPresidents are not kings,\u201d she wrote in her ruling that Trump\u2019s former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify before Congress about the Mueller report. That\u2019s a case that seems destined for the Supreme Court regardless of whether Democrats wait to impeach Trump. But Chairman Adam Schiff made clear in a letter to members that he has no intention of waiting for courts to sort things out, and moreover that he thinks the failure of White House staff to testify is further evidence of obstruction. Read that here. One more person we haven\u2019t heard from: The whistleblower The whistleblower set this whole thing in motion with the complaint that was filed back on August 12. The whistleblower\u2019s lawyers argue that so much of the complaint has been corroborated that the whistleblower doesn\u2019t need to testify at this point, and the law protects the whistleblower\u2019s right to anonymity. He used to say there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d and suggested that the whistleblower was a partisan working to undermine him. Now Trump dismisses it in the same way he dismissed the Russia investigation, as a hoax. This week, he called it a \u201cphony Impeachment Scam.\u201d This is an extremely detailed and increasingly complicated story.

            "article_content": "Two weeks of dramatic and incriminating public impeachment testimony did little to sever the strong bond between President Donald Trump, his Republican supporters and conservative media propagandists. In fact, the more damning the suggestions of an abuse of power become, the deeper it forces Trump\u2019s defenders into his wild brew of conspiracy theories, disinformation and distortion. Trump is facing accusations that he withheld nearly $400 million in military aid and other recognition for Ukraine to try to force it to investigate a domestic opponent \u2013 Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden \u2013 and 2016 Democrats. But despite an impeachment case that solidified in two weeks of public testimony, there are increasing signs that the President\u2019s aggressive approach and mastery over the Republican Party in Washington is preventing any slippage of support from allies as Democrats prepare to pause the inquiry for Thanksgiving. Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy on Sunday ignored the expertise of US spy agencies, congressional probes and the first half of the Mueller report to lend credibility to Trump\u2019s claim that it was Ukraine that meddled in the 2016 election. Asked by \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor Chris Wallace whether he believed Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential race, Kennedy answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know, nor do you, nor do any others.\u201d \u201cIt could also be Ukraine. I\u2019m not saying that I know one way or the other,\u201d Kennedy said. Kennedy was embracing a fresh attempt by the President to cast doubt on the evidence of what US intelligence agencies say was Moscow\u2019s operation to undermine faith in the 2016 election, denigrate Democrat Hillary Clinton and to help Trump win. The President\u2019s effort seems designed not only to give him a motive for leaning on Ukraine for an investigation but also to indulge his anger at any suggestion his win in 2016 was not legitimate. READ: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff's full 'State of the Union' interview with Jake Tapper on impeachment He is also trying to build a narrative ahead of a Senate impeachment trial that he was actually the victim of an international conspiracy \u2013 not the perpetrator of one. The latest counter-attack by the President comes with his White House, as is the case almost every Monday morning, consumed by new controversies that popped up over the weekend. There is confusion over the exact circumstances of the firing of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer over the disciplining of a Navy SEAL to which Trump objected. And several media reports and document releases over the weekend appeared to support the testimony of several witnesses last week that the off-the-books diplomatic scheme in Ukraine was wider than it first appeared. In retrospect, advice from political savants for Trump to treat impeachment like former President Bill Clinton \u2013 ignore the noise and keep on working for Americans \u2013 seems quaint and so 20th Century. Instead, Trump has pioneered his own unique strategy \u2013 ignore the mounting pile of damaging testimony and convince his supporters to dismiss the evidence of their own eyes. This is an approach consistent with the President\u2019s famous comment in a speech to veterans last year: \u201cWhat you are seeing and what you are reading is not what\u2019s happening.\u201d Its effect is to create a wave of confusion and false narratives that undermine or swamp the true facts of the Ukraine scandal and diminish the potency of the most damaging witness accounts. And such is Trump\u2019s political omnipotence among his supporters that he effectively gives his GOP allies a choice \u2013 engage with the evidence and cross him or join his fact-fogging operation. Key witnesses, solid evidence, the words of acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and even the President\u2019s own words in the rough transcript of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggest very strongly that there was an attempt to coerce Ukraine. Yet House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said last week that \u201cI think it was very clear there was no quid pro quo\u201d and held out the call with Zelensky as proof of no wrongdoing, even though it seems to show quite the opposite and alarmed several senior national security officials. Schiff pushes Bolton to testify but will not go to court to force him McCarthy confidently predicted that no Republicans would break from the President in the House impeachment vote \u2013 in a sign of how tribal politics now dominates Washington institutions and how Trump\u2019s power dominates the GOP on Capitol Hill.

Lee Zeldin did not go quite as far as Kennedy on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday but did create an equivalence between Russian and Ukrainian election meddling. \u201cI believe that Russians interfered in the 2016 elections,\u201d said Zeldin, citing intelligence assessments. \u201cIt\u2019s also true, it\u2019s indisputable that there were Ukrainians who interfered in the 2016 election,\u201d Zeldin said. On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said that Ukraine \u2013 as well as Russia \u2013 interfered in the US election. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about both. I\u2019m concerned about both,\u201d Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said. Such comments work for Trump on two levels. First they give credence to his conspiracy theory that Ukraine tried to bring him down in 2016 and that he is correct to demand an investigation. And second, they give the impression that Russia and Ukraine are equally bad, that the email hacking, social media campaigns and approaches to the Trump campaign by Russians were less sinister than they appear. While there are instances of Ukrainian politicians criticizing candidate Trump, there is no evidence of the kind of broad government-sanctioned effort by intelligence agencies to interfere in the election as Russia did. What is particularly astounding about this spectacle is that the Republican Party \u2013 which prides itself as having won the Cold War by facing down Moscow \u2013 is effectively buying into a conspiracy theory energetically advanced by Russia itself. US intelligence officials who briefed senators in recent months have reiterated the point that Russia has been engaging in a years-long effort to shift the blame of Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 election to Ukraine, CNN reported Friday. This was a warning echoed by Trump\u2019s former top Russia expert Fiona Hill in her stunning testimony last Thursday. \u201cRussia\u2019s security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe are running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.\u201d Trump set the tone for the post-hearings propaganda campaign late last week. He showed up on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on Friday morning with a new offensive to discredit the fact pattern painstakingly laid out by investigators and former officials. \u201cI think it\u2019s very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing,\u201d Trump said. He claimed he hardly knew most witnesses who testified \u2014 including US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who spoke about his expletive-laden calls with the President. Trump accused former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch \u2013 who was pulled home after apparently getting in the way of his back-door foreign policy scheme \u2013 of refusing to put up his photo in her embassy. The President did not provide any proof for his assertion. What's missing from the Democrats' case against Trump The tactic supported Trump\u2019s effort to prove that he\u2019s the victim of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy by elite bureaucrats who have long conspired to throw him out of office. And he again described his notorious July 25 phone call with Zelensky in which he asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d and a probe into the Bidens as \u201cperfect.\u201d In this way, the President, who made millions understanding the value of rebranding, is seeking to repackage the most damning single piece of evidence against him. The GOP faced several choices after two weeks of hearings that built a strong case that the President abused his power to demand Ukraine to help him damage a domestic political opponent. It could have acknowledged troubling facts corroborated by non-partisan career officials that Trump was pursing his own interests, not America\u2019s, in foreign policy towards a key ally. Or the party could have expressed discomfort with Trump\u2019s behavior, but argued that Democrats did not prove their case conclusively \u2014 though such an approach was complicated by the White House refusal to provide key evidence and witnesses. But there are also principled arguments to be made that while the President might have dishonored the expectations of his office, the polarizing national trauma of impeachment would overmatch the gravity of his transgressions. Given that an election is looming in less than a year, such an argument might have practical as well as political resonance. Then Republicans had a third choice: embrace Trump\u2019s campaign of denials and distortion designed to bury the case in a confusing layer of conspiracy theories and untruths. House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes blazed the trail for Trump defenders, with opening statements in last week\u2019s hearings that sounded like conservative media monologues. Fiona Hill left a legacy for angry women during impeachment hearing His committee counterpart, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who sat stone faced through the grandstanding by Nunes last week, said Sunday that even without Republican buy-in, Democrats were pressing ahead. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have to decide what our constitutional duty is, even if our colleagues in the GOP and Congress have decided they\u2019re more committed to the person and the president than their constitutional duty,\u201d he told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIf this was Barack Obama had done this, they would have voted to impeach him in a heartbeat with a fraction of the evidence,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter this is a Republican president.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The gravity and drama of the first televised impeachment hearings into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency on Wednesday will imprint themselves on history and reverberate far from Washington. The most crucial stage of the Ukraine investigation so far has profound implications beyond the political and personal reputation of Trump and the question of whether he abused his power by seeking political favors from a foreign power. His fate will have sweeping consequences for the future understanding of powers vested within the presidency itself. The hearings will test whether the ancient machinery of US governance can effectively investigate a President who ignores the charges against him and fogs fact in defining a new post-truth political era. And notwithstanding Trump\u2019s current Republican firewall, the hearings will begin to decide whether a presidency that has rocked America and the world will reach its full natural term. Fact-checking Trump's barrage of anti-impeachment tweets The fact that there is an impeachment process at all \u2013 and a debate over whether the President is so corrupt he should be ousted between elections \u2013 is in itself something of a national tragedy. There\u2019s a reason why Gerald Ford called the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974 before he was formally impeached, a \u201clong national nightmare.\u201d The next few months will scar America for years to come. As the Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson impeachments did before it, this process will reflect and intensify the ideological civil war that is tearing at national unity and threatening the nation\u2019s forward momentum. Democratic leaders, who long resisted demands from their party\u2019s liberal activists to impeach Trump, are taking a considerable risk by embarking on this momentous constitutional road. Given the explosive revelations about Trump\u2019s conduct in Ukraine however, they may have had little political choice. In all likelihood, Republican senators will not vote to convict and oust Trump, opening the possibility of a political backlash. It\u2019s just not clear yet whether Democrats or the GOP would come off worse. Trump is likely to view an eventual escape from censure as a validation of his unrestrained behavior and a license to continue to test constitutional customs. The case for and against impeaching President Donald Trump \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that the strongest argument for impeachment was also the strongest argument against it, which is, if you don\u2019t impeach a president who commits conduct of this kind, what does that say to the next president about what they can do and to the next Congress?\u201d House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said in an interview with National Public Radio on Tuesday. \u201cAt the same time, if you do impeach, but the President is acquitted, what does that say to the next president? The next Congress? There\u2019s no good or simple answer,\u201d he said. Yet for all the bitterness and uncertainty that it stirs, the impeachment process is also a reaffirmation and test of the democratic codes of self-government first set down in Philadelphia nearly two-and-a-half centuries ago. It will provide the most significant judgment yet on a riotous presidency that has already skipped past one existential scandal in the Russia election meddling scheme. The Democratic charge that could see Trump shamed as only the third impeached President in history could hardly be more grave. He is effectively accused of committing a crime against the nation itself and the political system that guards its freedoms. Specifically, Democrats charge Trump with conspiring with a foreign power to influence a US election, an offense many observers believe satisfies the impeachable standard of \u201cTreason, Bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d The eventual case may encompass campaign finance offenses, the flouting of his presidential oath to uphold the law and the Constitution and allege obstruction over his withholding of witnesses and evidence. In more symbolic terms, it would validate the fears of America\u2019s founders of one of the greatest threats to their democratic experiment. \u201cHistory and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government,\u201d wrote the first President, George Washington, in his farewell address. To force Trump\u2019s removal from office, Democrats must use the hearings beginning on Wednesday to turn independents and moderate Republicans against him. They hope that the testimony of witnesses including foreign service lifers such as Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Kiev, who opens proceedings on Wednesday, will come across as credible and defang the GOP counterattack. They will portray ousted US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie \u201cMasha\u201d Yovanovitch, who will testify on Friday, as a victim of Trump\u2019s scheme to benefit himself and not US national interests.  They are striving to change the political calculation of GOP senators currently unlikely to desert Trump and build the two-thirds majority to convict him in a Senate trial. Failing that, Trump could be so damaged by impeachment that his hopes of breaking out beyond his base in the 2020 will be doomed. In essence, Democrats are seeking to build made-for-TV moments that can tell the story of the Ukraine scandal in simple terms \u2013 as the Senate Watergate hearings did in the Nixon era. It is unclear whether they have a witness to match the impact of former White House counsel John Dean, who testified that he told Nixon that \u201cthere was a cancer growing on the presidency.\u201d Democrats argue Trump built a sophisticated back-door diplomatic effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter and a conspiracy theory that Kiev and not Russia meddled in the 2016 election. There is no evidence of wrongdoing in Ukraine by either Biden. Democrats allege that the quid pro quos in this equation involved $400 million in delayed military aid to Ukraine and conditions initially imposed on a White House visit for its President, Volodymyr Zelensky. The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in July \u2013 in which the US leader asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d and mentioned Biden \u2013 forms the core of the case. Democrats have also collected evidence that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was barnstorming around in Europe trying to close the deal with Ukraine and bypassing US diplomats. \u201cGo talk to Rudy, he knows all about Ukraine,\u201d GOP mega-donor turned US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that Trump told his subordinates. Trump has refused to produce, or Democrats have declined to launch long legal challenges to access, key witnesses who could establish or rule out any direct link with the President. Yet acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney effectively confirmed a quid pro quo with Ukraine over military aid in a stunning White House briefing that included the words: \u201cGet over it.\u201d Ultimately, the Democratic appeal to the American people will come down to this: Is it credible that all this was going on and Trump did not direct it \u2013 or at least knew all about it? House Republicans lay out central defenses of Trump in memo ahead of public impeachment hearings Since the Ukraine scandal erupted, Republicans have struggled to coin a consistent defense of the President. His rough transcript of the call with Zelensky backfired as it was far from \u201cperfect\u201d as Trump said it was. A flow of leaked witness testimony has deepened Trump\u2019s trouble. In response, the GOP has demanding the unmasking of a whistleblower in the intelligence community that first raised the alarm about Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee are certain to stage sideshows to thwart Democratic hopes of presenting the public with a clear narrative. Democrats have struggled to stop previous high-profile hearings from turning into circuses. This time, Schiff has decreed witnesses will first be questioned by professional counsel from both sides \u2013 at least delaying political hijinks. In a strategy memo released on Monday, GOP House members signaled they would argue that there was no coercion in the Trump-Zelensky call. They say that the fact military aid was eventually released in September means there is no case to answer and that it was Trump\u2019s skepticism of corruption in Ukraine that led him to delay it in the first place. Each point is debatable. Perhaps that\u2019s one reason why Trump is desperate to discredit the impeachment probe just as he did with Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation. The President is flooding the zone with a characteristic trove of conspiracy theories, outright lies, distractions and misinformation designed to confuse the public and fog clarity. Yet an impeachment hearing is such a profound moment that the President\u2019s normal weapons may not work so well this time. \u201cThe Republicans have staked their defense on a variety of techniques that don\u2019t address the charges. They claim this a biased investigation, that this is a witch hunt,\u201d said Claire Finkelstein, faculty director at the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. The Republican approach is essentially a bet that their hurricane force rhetoric will obscure the seriousness of the charges that are being presented to the public. \u201cThere are some signs this is wearing thin for the American people and that they are actually attending to the content of the investigations,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cOnce the public hearings begin the public will focus on the actual charges. That is what happened with Nixon in the Watergate hearings.\u201d",

            "article_content": ")A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s Impeachment Watch newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Yesterday, we learned that European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland changed his testimony to say he remembered details about a quid pro quo after hearing about what others were telling impeachment investigators. Bill Taylor, the top US official in Ukraine at the moment, didn\u2019t need to have his memory jogged to remember the quid pro quo; he took detailed notes in real time and recited them back to impeachment investigators. And there\u2019s no doubt in his mind that US military and security aid for Ukraine was contingent on that country launching investigations to help Trump in the US. Taylor said the investigations President Donald Trump wanted into his rival Joe Biden would have equaled election meddling and that Ukraine announcing them was his nightmare. (More below on that.) He also said the idea for the exchange came from Rudy Giuliani. Read the full story. In text messages with Volker and Sondland, Taylor threatened to quit to prevent a \u201cnightmare.\u201d Read those exchanges here. Here\u2019s what he told members of Congress he was talking about: \u201c\u2018The nightmare\u2019 is the scenario where President Zelensky goes out in public, makes an announcement that he\u2019s going to investigate Burisma and the election in 2016, interference in 2016 election, maybe among other things,\u201d Taylor told the House committees. \u201cThe nightmare was he would mention those two, take all the heat from that, get himself in big trouble in this country and probably in his country as well, and the security assistance would not be released. That was the nightmare.\u201d Here\u2019s the synopsis from our reading team, which has been breaking down what we learned from the Taylor transcripts: Taylor is the man the Trump administration cajoled back into service when Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was pulled out of Kiev at short notice. He\u2019s the down-the-middle diplomat with military service who served under Republican presidents. No wonder that he\u2019s the guy Democrats are planning to bring up first when they begin open testimony in front of the American people next week. It all comes down to the Senate Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was right when he predicted Tuesday that if a vote to remove Trump from office were to take place today, he\u2019d be fine. If Democrats want to see Trump impeached, they must change minds. CNN\u2019s John King had an excellent analysis on \u201cInside Politics\u201d about how quickly the impeachment effort is moving and how everything changes next week when they moving from fact-finding to the very public and more consequential portion of this. \u201cThink about watching a TV crime drama where you try to build your case,\u201d King said. \u201cPart of that is the factual evidence. But part of that is getting the jury\u2019s attention.\u201d Can Democrats change minds? \u201cAre the Democrats ready to bring this public in a captivating way at a time when the American people are pretty evenly divided on the question of should you be doing this?\u201d Republicans prepare their counteroffensive Rep. Jim Jordan, who is primed to be a key messenger for Republicans at open hearings, is already criticizing Democrats\u2019 choice for their lead witness. He asked why Ukraine Special Envoy Kurt Volker, who abruptly quit his post at the beginning of the impeachment, isn\u2019t the first one up. \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want to call him as the first witness, even though he was the first witness to be deposed,\u201d Jordan told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju Wednesday. Order of events: Wednesday, Nov. 13: Bill Taylor, who saw quid pro quo, and George Kent, who was sidelined Friday, Nov. 15: Fiona Hill, the recalled ambassador Who\u2019s who? Read this Never mind the subpoena \u2013 What happens when you defy an impeachment subpoena? Sometimes, nothing. The House has withdrawn its demand to Charles Kupperman, the John Bolton aide who was on the July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call in part because investigators don\u2019t want to spend the time fighting over it in court. Whistleblower objection \u2013 Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul objected to an otherwise unanimous resolution (nonbinding, but still) to recognize the role of Congress and the White House in protecting whistleblowers. He called for media organizations to out the whistleblower during an event with Trump this week. Why Pompeo dragged his feet \u2013 David Hale, a top official at the State Department, told the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not forcefully defend Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch when she was attacked by Trump because it could hold up aid to Ukraine. Turf battle \u2013 There\u2019s disagreement in the White House over who should lead Trump\u2019s impeachment communication strategy, reports Politico. The turf battle may be real, but is there any doubt that it will be Trump leading the strategy? Democrats won key elections in Kentucky and Virginia - does that threaten GOP support of the President? CNN political director David Chalian gauges the political winds with CNN political analyst Amanda Carpenter. Plus, CNN reporter Daniel Dale fact-checks Trump\u2019s shifting impeachment defense. Listen here. The President has invited foreign powers to interfere in the US presidential election. Democrats want to impeach him for it. It is a crossroads for the American system of government as the President tries to change what\u2019s acceptable for US politicians.

A day after his turn voluntarily sitting before the impeachment inquiry, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was back at work in the National Security Council at the White House complex. His fellow officials are wondering whether their efforts are being undermined and worry the President could sour on the entire body, ignoring its expert advice as he fumes about its role in the current crisis. That\u2019s all in this must-read look at what is happening inside the NSC. Morrison to testify \u2013 and step down Vindman\u2019s boss, Tim Morrison, will testify Thursday before the impeachment inquiry. He\u2019s also leaving his post soon, according to a source familiar with his decision. Bolton\u2019s revenge? House investigators are inviting the recently ousted national security adviser to testify next week. Bolton used the term \u201cdrug deal\u201d to describe the shadow foreign policy operation. Investigators also invited testimony from John Eisenberg, the NSC lawyer who Vindman and others notified of their concerns. Read the full story on that here. Key vote \u2013 Thursday will see the first official House vote on impeachment when Congressmen vote on a slate of procedures for the inquiry pushed by Democrats. Testimony \u2013 Morrison testifies Thursday and he will be a key witness. Vindman believes Trump was personally holding aid for investigation \u2013 Jake Tapper reports tonight that Vindman told congressional investigators in his deposition Tuesday that he became convinced that President Donald Trump personally was ordering the withholding of $400 million in aid for Ukraine as a way of forcing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to publicly announce an investigation into the Bidens, sources told CNN. Omissions from July 25 transcript \u2013 Shortly after we sent this newsletter last night, it was reported that Vindman testified that key words and crucial context were dropped, omitted, and hidden by ellipses in the White House transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian President. White House denial \u2013 \u201cThe media is reporting that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman claims he proposed filling in words that were missing in areas where ellipses were shown in the transcript \u2013 this is false,\u201d said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham in a statement. Taylor will \u201cfulfill his duty\u201d if asked to testify \u2013 The US diplomat who confirmed the pressure campaign by Trump on Ukraine to investigate Burisma and who also perceived it as a quid pro quo will \u201cfulfill his duty\u201d and return to Capitol Hill to testify publicly if asked, according to a source familiar with his thinking. He\u2019d be a logical choice as one of the first witnesses when the impeachment probe begins to hold public hearings likely in a few weeks. Jared Kushner met Zelensky in June \u2013 Both attended a June 4 dinner hosted by US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland in Brussels. The meeting was reported at the time, before the Ukraine scandal. But a photo of the two of them has resurfaced. Kushner told Israel\u2019s Channel 13 this week the impeachment inquiry is \u201csilly games.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has asked the Secretary of the Army what he\u2019s doing to protect Vindman. Schumer referred to the \u201cvitriol\u201d pointed toward Vindman by Trump and others and raised concern it \u201cmay result in professional reprisals and threats to his personal safety and that of his family.\u201d CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr reports Vindman is protected under whistleblower laws. Students of relatively recent impeachment history will recall that a main backer of impeaching Bill Clinton for his adulterous affair was Bob Livingston, heir apparent to Newt Gingrich, who was leaving his role as House Speaker in 1998. That is, until Livingston\u2019s shock resignation and admission that he had engaged in his own adulterous affairs. It wasn\u2019t a crisis of conscience that led Livingston to resign, but rather the fact that Hustler Magazine\u2019s Larry Flynt offered $1 million to anyone who could prove an affair with a high government official. He apparently got multiple takers who pointed to Livingston. Read a CNN report from 1998 about Livingston\u2019s fall. Seriously, this was stunning at the time. He apologized to his wife and family on the House floor and had anger in his voice when he said, \u201cSo I will set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow.\u201d He stopped pursuing the Speakership and didn\u2019t run for reelection. Why on earth are we talking about this right now? It turns out that Livingston, who played such a big role in the impeachment of Bill Clinton, has a bit of a part in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Now a swamp creature for hire, Livingston repeatedly called Catherine Croft, a State Department official who testified in closed doors today about pressure she felt to oust Marie Yovanovitch, now the former US ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cDuring my time at the NSC, I received multiple calls from lobbyist Robert Livingston, who told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired,\u201d Croft said in prepared testimony. \u201cHe characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros. It was not clear to me at the time\u2014or now\u2014at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d Who was Livingston working for? As CNN reported Wednesday: Livingston\u2019s lobbying firm has worked for Ukrainian politician Yulia Tymoshenko, a top but unsuccessful candidate in the country\u2019s most recent election, according to its federal foreign lobbying disclosure. In December 2018, the Livingston Group disclosed she was introduced to Rudy Giuliani. It\u2019s unknown if Livingston\u2019s calls to the NSC were connected in any way to his work for the Ukrainian official or his firm\u2019s contact with Giuliani. Croft\u2019s testimony is a good example of how diplomats are feeling a new kind of pressure during the Trump administration. While she was fielding calls from a former lawmaker now working for a Ukrainian politician, there\u2019s also the accusation from the Trump administration felt by diplomats that they\u2019re part of the so-called \u201cdeep state.\u201d What it feels like CNN\u2019s Nicole Gaouette writes: The State Department has been catapulted into a \u201cstrange parallel universe,\u201d a Washington-based official said, groping for a way to describe the way staff feel about the situation: The administration they serve is attacking them, career diplomats are having to hire lawyers simply for having done their jobs and anger is growing about the silence on the seventh floor, where the Secretary\u2019s offices are housed. Many diplomats invoked Pompeo\u2019s history as a House lawmaker who drove the Benghazi hearings that looked into \u2013 and, they said, politicized \u2013 the death of the widely respected and admired US Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stephens. Pompeo did push back for Yovanovitch Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is facing confirmation to be US Ambassador to Russia, testified Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he was aware Giuliani had lobbied for the the removal of Yovanovitch from Ukraine. He also said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed back on the efforts to have Yovanovitch recalled from her post. Today I wrote that Trump wants a Lt. Col. Oliver North. What he\u2019s got is Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. North was a Marine officer detailed to the National Security Council under President Ronald Reagan who was convicted of obstructing a congressional inquiry into the Iran-Contra scandal. Vindman is an Army officer detailed to the National Security Council who just testified about his efforts to document Trump\u2019s pressure on the Ukrainian President to investigate Joe Biden. It goes on from there to look at how Trump has purged the military men from his Cabinet and inner circle and suggests his idea of loyalty might be at the bottom of it. Read the whole thing. For more on the military aspect Today on the Impeachment Watch podcast, host CNN reporter and producer Marshall Cohen talks through the latest impeachment inquiry developments with CNN national security reporter Kylie Atwood and Rear Admiral John Kirby, USN (ret), a CNN military and diplomatic analyst. Listen here. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who led the band of Republican congressman who barged into the secure deposition of Pentagon official Laura Cooper last week, is now calling on the Ethics Committee to investigate House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff for his behavior from the Russia probe and now during the impeachment probe. The Senate Majority Leader does not say things he doesn\u2019t want to say. And Ted Barrett, CNN\u2019s Senate producer, sees that every day and translates it in this excellent description of how McConnell avoided answering questions about Vindman on Tuesday. One question we\u2019ve been asked several times at impeachment@cnn.com is this: If, somehow, Trump were removed from office, could he then try to run again? We reached out to the nation\u2019s top impeachment historian, Professor Frank Bowman at the University of Missouri Law School (read his history of impeachment, people), and he gave us an extremely detailed answer, which boils down to: \u201cNo.\u201d Bowman: If the Senate were to vote to convict Mr. Trump, it could then (in modern practice) take a second vote to disqualify him, pursuant to Art I, Sec 3: \u201cJudgment of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United States.\u201d  If the Senate votes to disqualify him, the presidency is an office of honor or profit. So he\u2019d be disqualified from ever holding the presidency again. That said, could he \u201crun\u201d?  Well, sure, if by that you mean announce a campaign, etc.  But the constitution is clear that he couldn\u2019t hold the office again. The President has invited foreign powers to interfere in the US presidential election. Democrats want to impeach him for it. It is a crossroads for the American system of government as the President tries to change what\u2019s acceptable for US politicians.

            "article_content": "There is no evidence to support President Donald Trump\u2019s claim, made repeatedly this past week, that top US diplomat to Ukraine Bill Taylor is a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d The low-key diplomat rose to global attention after testifying on Capitol Hill in the impeachment inquiry. He provided a damning account of how Trump told his appointees to establish a quid pro quo, trading much-needed US military aid for political favors from Ukraine. Trump first made the unfounded accusation against Taylor in a tweet on Wednesday, and repeated it twice on Friday to a gaggle of reporters on the White House lawn. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem,\u201d Trump said, referring to Taylor. \u201cHe\u2019s a Never Trumper and his lawyer\u2019s a Never Trumper.\u201d Facts First: There is zero public evidence that Taylor is a Never Trumper. All available information paints him as respected and apolitical public servant. But Trump is correct when it comes to Taylor\u2019s attorney John Bellinger, who helped lead the charge of Republicans against Trump in 2016. There is no indication that Taylor has ever donated to political candidates for federal office, according to Federal Election Commission data. Taylor has a relatively common name, but there are no records matching his name, home state of Virginia and employment history. After he was appointed by then-President George W. Bush to be the US ambassador to Ukraine in 2006, he told lawmakers that he never contributed to any political campaigns, according to the congressional record. He was confirmed by voice vote by the Republican-controlled Senate. At that time, Taylor disclosed that his wife made one political donation before: She gave $150 in 2003 to 21st Century Democrats, a political action committee that backs \u201cgenuinely progressive\u201d and \u201cpopulist\u201d Democrats. The group endorsed Barack Obama\u2019s campaign for Senate in 2004. In the Senate disclosures, Taylor detailed a slew of donations his parents gave to Republicans over the years. This included money to Arizona Sen. John McCain, Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cI\u2019ve known Bill Taylor for 26 years, and he doesn\u2019t take positions based on politics,\u201d said former US Ambassador to Ukraine Carlos Pascual, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton and stayed on during the Bush administration. \u201cBill Taylor is a guy who volunteered for Vietnam. He isn\u2019t a radical. Anyone who starts barking up that tree has got to get their facts straight.\u201d Nine additional former State Department officials who previously spoke to CNN described Taylor as a person of high character who was more likely to put sound foreign policy before politics. He was so respected that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked him to come out of retirement to lead the US embassy in Kiev this year, a position he first held during the Bush administration. Trump\u2019s disdain for Taylor apparently isn\u2019t shared by Pompeo, one of the President\u2019s closest allies. In an interview on Friday with The Sunflower, the student-run newspaper at Wichita State University, Pompeo voiced some subdued approval of Taylor\u2019s performance since taking over in Ukraine. \u201cHe and I both share this vision for how American interests in Ukraine can properly be represented. I have every reason to think that he\u2019s still out there, banging away at that problem set,\u201d Pompeo said. Unlike Trump\u2019s claims against Taylor, his criticism of Taylor\u2019s lawyer John Bellinger is accurate. Someone as outspoken as Bellinger is surely an interesting choice of attorney for Taylor, who has been described as a \u201cquiet guy\u201d by people who know him well. But associating with Bellinger does not make Taylor a Never Trumper himself. He may have just wanted an attorney with strong credentials in DC. A registered Republican, Bellinger served under the Bush administration first as senior associate counsel to the President and later as legal adviser to the State Department. In August 2016, months before the general election, Bellinger drafted a letter that was co-signed by 50 senior Republican national security and foreign policy experts and stated that Trump was \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be President and \u201cwould put at risk our country\u2019s national security and well-being.\u201d \u201c(Trump) weakens U.S. moral authority as the leader of the free world,\u201d the letter said. \u201cHe appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws, and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary.\u201d After Trump was elected, Bellinger joined \u201cChecks and Balances,\u201d a group of conservative lawyers formed to speak out against Trump. The group also includes George Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who supports impeachment and rails against Trump almost daily on Twitter. Bellinger told The New York Times that the group came together because they felt \u201cconservative lawyers are not doing enough to protect constitutional principles that are being undermined by the statements and actions of this president.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Two weeks\u2019 worth of testimony in the House impeachment probe paints a much deeper and detailed picture into how the President directed his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to effectively supplant US policy in Ukraine \u2014 and to push the country toward investigating the President\u2019s potential 2020 political opponent. The testimony shows that Trump played a key role in the US diplomatic effort to push Ukraine to open an investigation that goes well beyond the President\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that formed the basis of the whistleblower complaint. While that complaint that alleged the President asked Ukraine\u2019s leader for assistance investigating his political opponent is what launched the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2014 and Trump has focused his attacks on the whistleblower and his \u201cperfect\u201d call \u2014 Democrats say the evidence they\u2019ve gathered from current and former Trump administration officials so far has bolstered their case enough. And it details a picture of an administration that been struggling for months to deal with Giuliani\u2019s central role in dictating US-Ukraine policy \u2014 with senior US officials stymied by Trump\u2019s demand to deal with his personal attorney who had been pursuing probes that could help the president\u2019s political interests. Now they contend they may not even need to talk to the whistleblower anymore. \u201cThe testimony and evidence we\u2019ve received all supports the central narrative that there was an official policy that was very supportive of Ukraine,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat. \u201cThere were numerous officials trying to keep that policy alive. But it ran into a shadow policy run by the President through Rudy Giuliani that was designed to advance his personal and partisan agenda.\u201d Democrats are gathering information about how Giuliani circumvented the government on US-Ukraine policy, from pushing out US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in the spring to urging Zelensky to announce an investigation into the 2016 election and Burisma, the company that hired former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. They\u2019re also zeroing in on why US security aid to Ukraine had been frozen and whether that was conditioned on Ukraine investigating Trump\u2019s 2020 political opponent in a quid pro quo. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney on Thursday said that the hold on aid was connected to Ukraine investigating the 2016 election \u2014 arguing that was separate from the Bidens and a legitimate request of a foreign government. Democrats say Mulvaney is helping to make their case. Mulvaney brashly admits quid pro quo over Ukraine aid as key details emerge \u201cMr. Mulvaney\u2019s acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\u201d said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment investigation, who called Mulvaney\u2019s admission \u201ca phenomenal breach of the President\u2019s duty to defend our national security.\u201d Democrats have interviewed six current and former Trump officials are part of the inquiry thus far, and they\u2019re teeing up numerous additional witnesses from the State Department, Pentagon and Office of Management and Budget and White House to fill out their case before they decide whether to move forward with impeaching a President for only the third time in US history. They hope they can wrap up the interviews in the next few weeks before voting on articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving. Republicans have repeatedly attacked Democrats for holding the impeachment investigation behind closed doors, arguing they are selectively leaking information to paint a misleading case in order to try to remove the President from office. \u201cRemember this whole thing started, the press all started going crazy, this whole thing was there was somehow some quid pro quo between aid and investigating the Bidens,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee who has led the Republican response to the probe. \u201cOf the stuff I can talk about in transcribed testimony, there has not been one bit of evidence to support that.\u201d Added Republican Florida Rep. Brian Mast: \u201cIf you\u2019re sending one American dollar, one American anything somewhere you should absolutely make sure you understand every single level of corruption that\u2019s going on in the place, especially a corrupt place like Ukraine.\u201d Asked if he found Trump\u2019s ask for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, Mast said: \u201cTo investigate every level of corruption? Absolutely, that\u2019s a responsibility by the administration. I stand by that.\u201d Following the release of the whistleblower complaint and the call transcript last month, Democrats began casting a net around administration officials who focused on Ukraine policy in the administration. They quickly gained a key piece of evidence from their first witness. US special envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker turned over to Congress encrypted text messages exchanged between US diplomats, Giuliani and top Ukrainian aides. The texts showed there was a link before Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky between Ukraine\u2019s opening of an investigation to prospect of a meeting between Trump and Zelensky. \u201cHad breakfast with Rudy this morning-teeing up call w (Zelensky aide Andriy) Yermak Monday,\u201d Volker wrote on July 19. \u201cMust have helped. Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation\u2014and address any specific personnel issues\u2014if there are any.\u201d The early win \u2013 getting access to Volker\u2019s damning text messages \u2013 was only possible because Volker abruptly resigned after the whistleblower complaint was released in September. Other State Department officials who might have critical evidence have been hampered by the Trump administration\u2019s hardline against turning over documents to the House. Current and former administration officials have filled out the narrative around the text messaging, testifying that Trump had directed officials to work with Giuliani on Ukraine, while Giuliani was pushing renewed scrutiny of the 2016 election that could undermine the Russia investigation and a probe into Burisma and the Bidens. Giuliani\u2019s work with Volker and US Ambassador to European Union Gordon Sondland were a significant point of contention within the Trump administration, according to testimony from the White House\u2019s former top adviser on Russia Fiona Hill. 'Forceful, blunt and undiplomatic': the ambassador now at the center of the impeachment probe She testified that then-national security adviser John Bolton was so concerned with Sondland pushing for an investigation at a July 10 meeting that he encouraged her to report the encounter to National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg. In addition, Hill reported that she had overheard Sondland talking about Burisma with Ukrainians officials after that meeting, and she said that Bolton had compared the whole operation to a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d Sondland disputed Hill\u2019s testimony that there was major disagreement during the meeting with Bolton on Ukraine. But Sondland\u2019s testimony also added to the Democrats\u2019 case, as he said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Trump directed him to work with Giuliani on Ukraine but did so at Trump\u2019s insistence. \u201cBased on the President\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky \u2026 or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cBut I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\u201d Democrats have a full schedule of witnesses lined up next week from the Pentagon, State Department, Office of Management and Budget and National Security Council. A key piece that has not publicly emerged from the impeachment testimony thus far is how Giuliani\u2019s push for an investigation was tied to the freezing of security aid for Ukraine this summer, which came at the direction of the White House. But acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s public comments Thursday may have helped Democrats make that connection. Mulvaney said that one of the reasons that the aid was held up was \u201ccorruption related to the DNC server\u201d \u2014 a reference to the baseless conspiracy theory that Trump has put forward that the Democrats\u2019 hacked server was in Ukraine. \u201cThat\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d Mulvaney said. Later Thursday, Mulvaney tried to clean up his comments, saying, \u201cThere never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d Democrats do believe that  Mulvaney\u2019s admission of an apparent quid pro quo tying the release of foreign security aid to Ukraine to an investigation into the 2016 election was significant and further evidence advancing the impeachment probe. But they also argue it isn\u2019t essential for the impeachment inquiry to move forward. \u201cThe reality is, as much as there\u2019s a lot of focus on a quid pro quo, I just want to remind everyone, you do not need a quid pro quo,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat. \u201cThe United States asking a foreign leader to interfere in an American presidential election is illegal, un-American, unpatriotic and in it of itself constitutes grounds for impeachment.\u201d After two weeks of witnesses, Democrats have already obtained compelling evidence bolstering another major allegation in the whistleblower complaint: that Trump and Giuliani orchestrated the abrupt removal of the US ambassador to Ukraine for political purposes. Documents and testimony from witnesses have corroborated the whistleblower\u2019s claim that Yovanovitch, a career diplomat, was recalled from Kiev \u201cbecause of pressure stemming from\u201d unproven allegations that she was part of an anti-Trump conspiracy in Ukraine. Trump has suggested he doesn\u2019t know who Yovanovitch is and isn\u2019t sure if he was involved in her removal, \u201cbut I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time,\u201d he said. She was recalled from Kiev in April and her ambassadorship was ended in May. Diplomats express alarm over Trump's treatment of former Ukraine ambassador The investigation has established that Giuliani gave the State Department a packet of materials with discredited information about Yovanovitch and her supposed disloyalty to Trump. The State Department\u2019s inspector general shared this with Congress, and the entire episode confirmed that Giuliani was trying to influence State Department personnel decisions from the outside. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony included a first-hand account of a conversation with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who informed her in April that Trump no longer wanted her out of Ukraine. \u201c(Sullivan) added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the (State) Department had been under pressure from the President to remove me since the Summer of 2018,\u201d Yovanovitch told lawmakers last week. \u201cHe also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.\u201d Sondland, a Trump political appointee, told lawmakers Thursday that Yovanovitch was \u201can excellent diplomat\u201d who was \u201ca delight to work with.\u201d He said he was sorry to see Yovanovitch pulled from her post and distanced himself from \u201cany campaign to disparage or dislodge her.\u201d And Michael McKinley, who was a senior adviser to Pompeo, testified that he quit last week because of Pompeo\u2019s refusal to publicly defend Yovanovitch from Giuliani\u2019s attacks. The former mayor has become a fixture in conservative media and has criticized Yovanovitch for months. While Democrats continue looking for evidence about a potential quid pro quo regarding US military assistance to Ukraine, they\u2019ve already come a long way on the Yovanovitch incident.",

            "article_content": "US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland was directed by President Donald Trump to work with Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine, he told Congress on Thursday, and was left with a choice: Abandon efforts to bolster a key strategic alliance or work to satisfy the demands of the President\u2019s personal lawyer. Sondland said he wasn\u2019t aware until \u201cmuch later\u201d that Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have included an effort to \u201cprompt the Ukrainians\u201d to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter and to involve the Ukrainians in the President\u2019s campaign, according to his opening statement, which was obtained by CNN in advance of the deposition. Sondland\u2019s revealing testimony is a clear break with Trump over Giuliani \u2014 he said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Trump wouldn\u2019t commit to a meeting sought by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until they spoke with Giuliani, who was pursuing an investigation into Biden, a potential political rival in Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. And the ambassador\u2019s testimony showcases how Trump put on hold an effort to strengthen relations with Ukraine until top US officials were in contact with his personal attorney. \u201cBased on the President\u2019s direction, we were faced with a choice: We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns,\u201d Sondland said in his opening statement. \u201cWe chose the latter path, which seemed to all of us \u2013 Secretary (Rick) Perry, Ambassador (Kurt) Volker, and myself \u2013 to be the better alternative,\u201d Sondland continued. \u201cBut I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign.\u201d Sondland\u2019s testimony Thursday comes as he\u2019s under fire for his role in the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, in which Trump repeatedly urged Zelensky to open an investigation into the Bidens. Sondland\u2019s testimony is likely to ratchet up the Democrats\u2019 focus on the concerns top officials expressed about Giuliani\u2019s involvement in Ukraine \u2014 and how they disagreed with Trump\u2019s insistence on using his private attorney to negotiate diplomatic efforts. 'Forceful, blunt and undiplomatic': the ambassador now at the center of the impeachment probe Sondland\u2019s text messages with the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, are a key data point for the impeachment investigation, in which Sondland told Taylor there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d after speaking to Trump about the matter. Sondland\u2019s testimony says that he knew of no arrangement tying US security assistance to Ukraine with an investigation into the Bidens \u2014 but also that it would be wrong to do so. \u201cLet me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong,\u201d Sondland said, according to the statement. \u201cWithholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings. In my opinion, security aid to Ukraine was in our vital national interest and should not have been delayed for any reason.\u201d Sondland said that he only spoke with Giuliani briefly this year, and that he was unaware that Trump raised investigating Biden with Zelensky on the July 25 call until the transcript was released last month. \u201cI was not on that July 25, 2019 call and I did not see a transcript of that call until September 25, 2019, when the White House publicly released it,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cNone of the brief and general call summaries I received contained any mention of Burisma or former Vice President Biden, nor even suggested that President Trump had made any kind of request of President Zelensky.\u201d Giuliani, however, was publicly discussing in the media his efforts to investigate the Bidens and Ukraine this spring, which included a campaign to remove then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom Giuliani accused of criticizing the President. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine. House Democrats questioned Sondland\u2019s contention that he was unaware of Giuilani\u2019s true motives. \u201cI think he\u2019s basically trying to defend his reputation and his own behavior. Some of the testimony that he provided was not credible to me with respect to his sort of not understanding all the things that were happening around him and in full view of the American people,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat. Sondland appeared to have \u201ca severe case of selective amnesia,\u201d said Rep. Harley Rouda, a California Democrat. Former White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill testified earlier this week that after Sondland had raised investigations in a July 10 meeting, concerning Hill and then-national security adviser John Bolton, and Hill then overheard Sondland discussing with Ukrainians Burisma, according to a source familiar with the testimony. Bolton urged Hill to report the incident to National Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg, according to a source. But Sondland disputed Hill\u2019s testimony that significant concerns were raised, saying there was little disagreement in the meeting, according to another source familiar with the testimony. Sondland also said he said he spoke recently with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was also in the meeting and confirmed his recollection of events, that source said. Sonland testified that virtually every time he mentioned Ukraine to the President, the refrain from Trump was to talk to Giuliani, the source said. Trump repeatedly said he had \u201cno interest in Ukraine\u201d and to talk to Giuliani whenever it came up in conversations, the source said of Sondland\u2019s testimony. Sondland, a major Trump donor and former hotel chain owner, has been at the heart of the Democratic impeachment inquiry led by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees because of his appearance on text messages provided to Congress between US diplomats, a top Ukrainian political aide and Giuliani. Rudy Giuliani's business dealings sit at the center of the deepening Trump-Ukraine scandal. Here's the latest. In the texts between Sondland and Volker, which Volker provided to Congress, a potential meeting between Zelensky and Trump was linked to Ukraine opening an investigation ahead of the Trump-Zelensky call, and afterward with Zelensky announcing the investigation publicly. Sondland tells Volker that Trump wanted a \u201cdeliverable\u201d before a meeting would be scheduled, which he says in his testimony was a reference to \u201cthe efforts of Ambassador Volker to encourage the Ukrainian government to adopt a public statement setting out its reform priorities.\u201d But he also plans to testified that Giuliani told the diplomats that the statement needed the two investigations \u201cof importance for the President.\u201d \u201cMr. Giuliani emphasized that the President wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into anti-corruption issues,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cMr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two anti-corruption investigatory topics of importance for the President.\u201d Several weeks later, Taylor raises concerns that a hold on US aid to Ukraine is tied to an investigation. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor writes to Sondland on September 9, prompting Sondland to respond that Taylor was incorrect and that \u201cthe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d Saying he was concerned the Ukrainians could perceive a connection, Sondland told lawmakers that he responded to Taylor after he called the President directly to ask about the Ukraine aid. \u201cI asked the President: \u2018What do you want from Ukraine?\u2019 The President responded, \u2018Nothing. There is no quid pro quo,\u2019\u201d Sondland said. \u201cThe President repeated: \u2018no quid pro quo\u2019 multiple times. This was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood.\u201d Sondland told House investigators Thursday that his text message was only based on his conversation with Trump, according to a source with knowledge of his testimony. In his prepared statement, Sondland aligned himself with career diplomats and passes responsibility for his role in the situation to political players, including Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Sondland also said that Pompeo, another potentially key player in the Ukraine effort who is so far refusing to turn over documents to the Hill, was aware of all his efforts on Ukraine policy and set him to work on the country from his first day on the job. Ukraine wouldn\u2019t naturally be the responsibility of the US\u2019s European Union expert, since it\u2019s not a member nation, Sondland\u2019s critics have said. Sondland countered Thursday that conflicts in Ukraine especially over its Crimean Peninsula are major security crises for Europe and the US. \u201cI understand that all my actions involving Ukraine had the blessing of Secretary Pompeo as my work was consistent with long-standing U.S. foreign policy objectives. Indeed, very recently, Secretary Pompeo sent me a congratulatory note that I was doing great work, and he encouraged me to keep banging away,\u201d Sondland said, according to his prepared statement. READ: Trump EU ambassador's testimony before Congress Sondland also told lawmakers he was unaware of any concern among top National Security Council officials regarding his efforts and in the planning of the July 25 call \u2014 contrary to what Trump\u2019s former adviser Fiona Hill told the House committees earlier this week when she testified then-National Security Adviser John Bolton said the operation carried out by Sondland and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was like a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d \u201cBut if Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, or others harbored any misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later,\u201d he said. Notably, Sondland expressed his support for Yovanovitch, the Ukrainian ambassador who was attacked by Giuliani and fired by Trump \u2014 and whose ouster has been a sore point for the career State Department officials who have testified in the impeachment inquiry thus far. \u201cI found her to be an excellent diplomat,\u201d Sondland said, adding: \u201cI was never a part of any campaign to disparage or dislodge her, and I regretted her departure.\u201d Sondland told the committee Thursday that he was not turning over any documents because the State Department has told him the documents are confidential to the executive branch or privileged. The White House has backed up the view that Sondland himself can\u2019t turn them over. Sondland\u2019s attorneys say that he has encouraged the State Department to make the documents available. The documents relevant to Sondland\u2019s testimony, according to a source familiar with the matter, include Sondland\u2019s communications with Hill and the National Security Council, emails and briefing materials assigning him to Ukraine issues at the start of his ambassadorship, Volker\u2019s introduction of Giuliani and Sondland and a July email between Volker, Taylor and Sondland agreeing Zelensky should stay out of the 2020 US presidential campaign. This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday. CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump drove Democrats to the first crucial pivot point of their impeachment confrontation on Tuesday with a defiant declaration that his administration would not cooperate with the investigation. In a fierce counter-attack after days of failing to control a torrent of damaging disclosures, the Trump White House branded the inquiry an illegal bid to overthrow the 2016 election and blocked testimony from a top diplomat. \u201cNever before in our history has the House of Representatives \u2013 under the control of either political party \u2013 taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue,\u201d White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her key committee chairs. The letter in effect gave notice of all out political warfare as part of the administration\u2019s strategy to deprive investigators of all the testimony and evidence that they have demanded, in a clear effort to throttle the capacity of the probe into whether Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political opponent \u2013 Joe Biden. Pelosi says there is no constitutional requirement supporting Trump\u2019s demand for a full House vote to initiate impeachment proceedings \u2013 one justification given for the President\u2019s refusal to cooperate. But Trump\u2019s move left her with grave strategic decisions on what to do next in a confrontation that puts to the test the integrity of America\u2019s bedrock separation of powers and will determine whether she truly gamed out this duel several steps ahead. Challenging Trump\u2019s position in court could bog down the impeachment drive in months of legal challenges. Folding the President\u2019s obstruction into articles of impeachment in short order could play into his claims that she\u2019s running a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and rushing the most consequential function of Congress. The American people will now be effectively asked whether a President who accepts few limits on his power can be held in check by a separate branch of government or whether he can avoid such an examination, a decision that will echo through history. Democrats are already arguing that Trump\u2019s position is a de facto admission of guilt based on a legal and political house of sand. \u201cI guess they haven\u2019t read the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, a Democrat who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIf they don\u2019t defend themselves, against the copious evidence that we already have, then I think it disadvantages them,\u201d Malinowski told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cThis is not the kind of investigation where we are starting with nothing \u2013 we are starting with everything.\u201d The nation\u2019s most serious political crisis in decades came to a head as more shocking details emerged of Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukraine. The now famous whistleblower wrote a memo that describes a White House official as characterizing the call with Volodymyr Zelensky as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfrightening,\u201d a source familiar with the whistleblower complaint said. The New York Times, which first reported the new details, said in its piece that White House lawyers discussed how to handle the discussion because in the official\u2019s view the president had clearly committed a criminal act.\u201d In another break in the drama, CNN reported that Gordon Sondland \u2013 the US ambassador to the EU who Trump prevented from testifying to Congress on Tuesday \u2013 directly called the President in September to find out what was going on amid discussions among his peers over whether US military aid to Ukraine was being withheld. The nugget raises the possibility that Sondland\u2019s text to a colleague that there was no quid pro quo involved was on the orders of the President himself \u2013 a possibility Democrats will surely want to investigate. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff suggested Monday that Sondland had texts and emails on a personal device that the State Department was refusing to hand over. The new revelations explain why the White House is refusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. It can\u2019t allow a window into wild, self-serving and possibly even criminal behavior by the President in his dealings with Ukraine that could turn Americans against him. As Democrats seek to make a case that the President defies constitutional norms and abuses his power by setting foreign policy for personal political ends, Trump\u2019s aides must try to slow their momentum and weave a tale of congressional overreach. The struggle intensified further after multiple polls showed a majority of Americans now support opening an impeachment inquiry. But there is not yet a majority for removing the President from office, underscoring the critical impact of the political battle in Washington now being fully joined by both sides. Trump\u2019s letter effectively dares Pelosi, who may want to protect her more moderate members from political damage, to hold a full vote in the House on moving forward with the inquiry. Such a vote was held in the last two impeachment sagas concerning Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, but there is nothing in the Constitution that mandates such a vote. Trump\u2019s team says the absence of such a vote means that he has no choice but to withhold cooperation to preserve the scope of his office for future occupants. \u201cAt a constitutional level, that is what we call complete and total nonsense,\u201d said CNN legal and national security analyst Susan Hennessey on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d The White House maintained that without such a vote, the President and other Executive Branch officials will be denied basic rights available to all Americans. It accused Pelosi of denying Trump the right to cross-examine witnesses, to have access to evidence, and for counsel to be present during depositions. \u201cPut simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen,\u201d Cipollone wrote. He also argued that the President did nothing wrong in his call with Zelensky, and claimed that Democrats had prejudiced the case with unfair process and had violated the separation of powers. The tone of the letter however was far more partisan in tone than legalistic, reflecting that the battle over Trump\u2019s fate will now come down to a vicious political fight. Mostly, it appeared to defend Trump based on the perceived unfairness of the political process rather than the merits of the Ukraine case. Pelosi vowed in her own letter to House Democrats: \u201cThe President will be held accountable. When it comes to impeachment, it is just about the facts and the Constitution,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the same time as President Trump is obstructing justice, abusing power and diminishing the office of the presidency, we have a responsibility to strengthen the institution in which we serve.  This is essential if we are to honor the separation of powers which is the genius of the Constitution.\u201d The Speaker could decide to call the President\u2019s bluff by scheduling a full House vote. But there is no guarantee that Trump would cooperate if a full House vote takes place. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to speculate on what would happen in various hypothetical situations\u201d Cipollone wrote. A vote would also give Republicans a platform to grandstand and to turn the impeachment process into a circus \u2013 as they have done in previous Democratic oversight hearings \u2013 a factor that might weigh on Pelosi\u2019s deliberations. But there is also an argument that offering Trump a blueprint for an open process, with clearly defined impeachment goals, is not just politically smart but it\u2019s the right thing to do at a perilous national moment that demands basic standards of fairness. As the shockwaves of Trump\u2019s letter rocked Capitol Hill, Democrats issued a subpoena for testimony and evidence from Sondland, who was stopped from offering a deposition on Capitol Hill by the White House hours before his Tuesday appointment. Still, as this tumultuous presidency has shown, refusing a congressional subpoena is less risky than ignoring a criminal summons. Democrats could hold recalcitrant witnesses in contempt but that would entail the kind of legal imbroglio they are seeking to avoid, which Trump plans to create. Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff hinted that the remedy for the refusal of Sondland and other key officials to testify would rebound against the President. \u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,\u201d Schiff told reporters. Girding for the battle ahead, the White House contacted outside lawyers as it seeks impeachment counsel. One of those attorneys is former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown reported on Tuesday. CNN\u2019s Pam Brown, Jim Acosta, Kylie Atwood, Jeremy Diamond, Gloria Borger, Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff on Tuesday called the State Department\u2019s blocking testimony of a key witness \u201cstrong evidence of obstruction\u201d of Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation, and the move prompted House Democrats to issue a subpoena in response. The State Department on Tuesday directed US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland not to testify before Congress, scrambling Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation and raising questions about whether they will be able to obtain testimony from other witnesses. But Schiff\u2019s sharp response to Sondland\u2019s absence is a sign of the escalating impeachment fight between the White House and Democrats. \u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents, we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,\u201d Schiff told reporters. In addition to blocking Sondland\u2019s testimony, Schiff said the ambassador indicated he had text messages or emails on a personal device provided to the State Department that State was withholding from Congress. The subpoena issued Tuesday evening demanded Sondland turn over documents by Monday, October 14, and appear for a deposition on Wednesday, October 16. \u201cIn light of Secretary Pompeo\u2019s direct intervention to block your appearance before our committees, we are left with no choice but to compel your appearance at a deposition pursuant to the enclosed subpoena,\u201d Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings and Schiff wrote in a letter to Sondland. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at an event in Seattle that the administration\u2019s decision to block Sondland was \u201can abuse of power for them to act in this way.\u201d Sondland\u2019s attorney Robert Luskin said State directed Sondland not to testify early Tuesday morning. \u201cHe is a sitting ambassador and employee of State and is required to follow their direction,\u201d Luskin said. \u201cAmbassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today. Ambassador Sondland traveled to Washington from Brussels in order to prepare for his testimony and to be available to answer the Committee\u2019s questions.\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, said he understood why the administration blocked Sondland\u2019s testimony, charging that Schiff wasn\u2019t running a fair investigation and that he was selectively releasing text messages from former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. Republicans are calling on Schiff to release Volker\u2019s interview transcript. \u201cI\u2019m all for bringing the ambassador in, but let\u2019s only do so after we release the full (Volker transcript),\u201d said Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina. Asked whether he had concerns about the President asking the Ukrainian President and China to investigate his political opponents, Jordan said Trump was \u201cdoing his job.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people going to a foreign government, the President\u2019s going to make sure that there\u2019s no corruption there,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing his job, his duty as the commander in chief, his duty as the President of the United States, so I don\u2019t have a concern there.\u201d Jordan added that he believed the public had a right to learn the identity of the whistleblower, given that the allegations could lead to impeachment of the President. Trump said on Twitter that Sondland should not testify before a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d \u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public\u2026to see,\u201d Trump tweeted. Sondland was set to testify behind closed doors before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees as part of the Democratic impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine. Lawmakers were eager to press him about text messages he exchanged related to Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the freezing of foreign aid to Ukraine that cut to the heart of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe. Sondland, a Trump donor and hotelier who has been EU ambassador since 2018, exchanged messages with Volker and a senior US diplomat in Ukraine about setting up the call between Zelensky and Trump and whether foreign aid was being withheld while Trump and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, pushed for Ukraine to open an investigation. Now his testimony is on hold \u2013 and it\u2019s not clear whether the department will also block other witnesses that Democrats are seeking. Sondland was supposed to be the first of two witnesses the committee would speak to this week, along with former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who is still a State Department employee. The State Department waited until Tuesday morning to direct Sondland not to testify, while it had been clear for several days he had agreed to appear. Administration officials were in discussions late Monday night about blocking Sondland from sitting down for his scheduled deposition today, an official familiar with the discussions told CNN. The talks centered around how much the White House should be cooperating with requests from House Democrats without a formal impeachment inquiry vote, which the White House has asserted they need for this to be a legitimate probe, despite Democrats saying otherwise. Trump and the White House have telegraphed they plan to send the House a letter indicating they will not comply with the Democrats\u2019 subpoena unless the House takes a vote to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry. The department also missed a Friday deadline set by House Democrats to respond to a subpoena and turn over documents related to Ukraine. A source familiar with discussions inside Trump\u2019s impeachment team says Sondland not appearing is \u201cpart of an overall strategy connected to what is viewed as irregularities in the House impeachment inquiry.\u201d \u201cThe days of playing nice are done,\u201d the source said. Democrats are eager to speak to both to gather more information about what was going on behind the scenes before and after Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. But Republicans have also found Sondland as a fruitful witness, as he pushed back in the text messages on the notion that the aid was connected to investigations. Republicans have argued that Volker\u2019s full testimony paints a different picture than the text message excerpts Democrats released last week. \u201cAmbassador Sondland believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States, and he stands ready to answer the Committee\u2019s questions fully and truthfully,\u201d Luskin said In the text messages provided to Congress, the Ukrainians\u2019 desire to have a one-on-one meeting between Trump and Zelensky is linked to the Ukrainians opening an investigation, something that was discussed before the July 25 phone call where Trump urged the Ukrainian President to investigate Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. \u201cHad breakfast with Rudy this morning-teeing up call w Yermak Monday. Must have helped. Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation\u2014and address any specific personnel issues\u2014if there are any,\u201d Volker wrote to Sondland the week before the call occurred. After the call, Sondland and Volker discussed potential dates for a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, and Sondland wrote that Trump \u201creally wants the deliverable,\u201d suggesting Zelensky make a public statement about an investigation. Sondland and Volker helped a senior Zelensky aide edit a statement about the investigation, including citing the 2016 election and Burisma, the company that hired Hunter Biden. There\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden in Ukraine. The following month, Sondland was part of a text exchange with Bill Taylor, a senior US diplomat in Ukraine, where Taylor repeatedly raises alarm that aid to Ukraine is being withheld to push for an investigation. \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d Taylor asked. \u201cCall me,\u201d Sondland responded. A week later, Taylor wrote: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d After the text was sent, Sondland called Trump to find out what was going on about withholding assistance, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.  Trump emphatically told him no quid pro quo, the source said. Sondland then responded to Taylor with a lengthy statement. \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d He then suggested if Taylor still had concerns, he should call Secretary of State Mike Pompeo or his executive secretary. Last week, Trump downplayed the text messages, saying Friday he didn\u2019t \u201ceven know most of these ambassadors.\u201d But he then praised Sondland\u2019s comments. Republican response tracker: GOP mostly silent on Trump's call to investigate Biden \u201cThe text message that I saw from Ambassador Sondland \u2013 who\u2019s highly respected \u2013 was: There\u2019s \u2018no quid pro quo.\u2019 He said that,\u201d Trump said. But Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, told The Wall Street Journal last week that Sondland had described to him a quid pro quo involving a commitment from Ukraine to investigate issues related to US elections and the status of foreign aid to Ukraine. Johnson said he confronted the President about it on a July 31 phone call, and Trump rejected that the two issues were connected. Johnson\u2019s office said after the Journal story published he did not recall that \u201cthe term \u2018quid pro quo\u2019 was ever used.\u201d Sondland, who is political appointee, was previously founder and CEO of the Provenance Hotels chain, according to his State Department biography. While he is ambassador to the European Union, he\u2019s had a specific interest in Ukraine. \u201cPresident Trump has not only honored me with the job of being the US ambassador to the EU, but he\u2019s also given me other special assignments, including Ukraine,\u201d he told UATV in July. \u201cWe have what are called the three amigos, and the three amigos are Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and myself. And we\u2019ve been tasked with sort of overseeing the Ukraine-US relationship between our contacts at the highest levels of the US government, and now the highest levels of the Ukrainian government.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump failed in his bid to undercut House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment move by releasing an account of a call with Ukraine\u2019s President. Top Democrats have concluded it showed clear evidence of him pressuring a foreign leader for political advantage. While Republicans immediately insisted \u2013 as has Trump \u2013 that there was no explicit quid pro quo in the call \u2013 an argument that is certain to form the centerpiece of the anti-impeachment case \u2013 Democrats say it contained the building blocks of an abuse of power case against the President. Previously, some Democratic lawmakers had been nervous before the White House released the transcript, fearing that Pelosi had overreached before seeing the details of the call and a whistle blower complaint against Trump. Trump fails to undercut Pelosi's impeachment gamble But the White House transcript shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pledging to buy more US military equipment, at which point, Trump asks him for a \u201cfavor\u201d and ask him to look into corruption allegations \u2013 for which there is no public evidence \u2013 against Democratic front-runner Joe Biden and his son Hunter. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff tweeted that that the transcript read like a \u201cclassic mob shakedown.\u201d Democratic presidential candidates were quick to declare that the transcript was a \u201csmoking gun.\u201d The release of the transcript has launched a full-bore political war that will now wage through the impeachment process. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Democrats would be \u201cinsane\u201d to impeach Trump over a telephone call. The Trump 2020 campaign was quick to unleash its own offensive. Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley also came to the President\u2019s defense, underling how the political terrain over the months-long impeachment fight to come is already being drawn. \u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo,\u201d Grassley said. List: The 195 House Democrats calling for an impeachment inquiry into Trump Democrats have argued that there doesn\u2019t need to be a direct warning from Trump that he would withhold $400 million in military aid to Ukraine if the President did not open an investigation into Biden. The pressure that appears to be implied in the transcript of the call is enough in itself to justify impeachment, they said. The White House transcript is only one element of the evidence that the Democrats will process as they launch formal impeachment hearings. More context in the case will be available to lawmakers if the White House follows through on its undertaking to release the whistleblower complaint. RELATED: Sign up for CNN\u2019s White House reporter Stephen Collinson\u2019s newsletter \u2018Meanwhile in America\u2019 \u2013 a daily analysis of US politics for global readers. Trump finds himself at the center of a rare and historic showdown as only the fourth president in US history to face the realistic threat of impeachment. \u201cThere has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have,\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. \u201cThe Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt!\u201d Trump does not want to be impeached and isn\u2019t welcoming this fight, sources tell CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Kaitlan Collins. Despite his defiant comments that he believes the process might help him politically, the President has worried about the possibility of being impeached for nearly a year, dating back to the weeks that followed the November 2018 midterms when Democrats won the House, a source close to the White House who routinely speaks with Trump said. His decision to quickly authorize the release of the call transcript as well as the whistleblower complaint are signs of Trump\u2019s wariness of entering the history books as an impeached president, the source added. According to some of the sources, Trump was preparing for a full day of meetings with foreign leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York when he paused to place a call to Pelosi Tuesday. Calls for his impeachment from her caucus had been ramping up, and Trump was hoping he could cool things down by speaking with her directly. The two discussed how the White House was at the time blocking the whistleblower\u2019s complaint from Congress, and it\u2019s unclear how that conversation ended. A short time later, Trump made the decision to release an unredacted version of the call transcript. He had been hearing from aides and lawmakers why he shouldn\u2019t, but Trump wanted to undercut the argument from Democrats that he acted inappropriately on the call, he said. When that announcement did little to change their minds, Trump told people he couldn\u2019t believe it. He and aides are now preparing to respond, and will argue that Democrats have wildly overreached. Trump's self-impeachment may be Pelosi's worst fear Pelosi is taking a huge gamble in using the ultimate constitutional instrument to wage a political battle that is neither clearly defined nor guaranteed to end in a way that benefits her party. If impeachment fails, she could unwittingly cause Trump to consider his unrestrained presidency that has frequently buffeted congressional norms as validated. And she could pave the way to the Democrats\u2019 ultimate nightmare: a second Trump term. Still there is no constitutional requirement for an impeachment inquiry to end in a full vote in the House. Even if the House inquiry ends with Articles of Impeachment and a majority vote in the chamber, no one believes that the Republican Senate will provide the two-thirds majority needed to oust Trump from office. So the impeachment collision will soon turn into a battle for America\u2019s political soul: How voters react could decide who wins the White House in 2020 and set the country\u2019s course for years to come. Pelosi has already argued that Trump\u2019s public admission that he spoke to Zelensky about Biden in itself represents an abuse of power by a President seeking foreign help to win reelection. \u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said in a somber news conference Tuesday. \u201cTherefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d Trump blasted the impeachment gambit as an attempt by Democrats to ruin his big trip to the United Nations General Assembly, and decried their \u201cbreaking news Witch Hunt garbage.\u201d Pelosi told her troops on Tuesday they had reached a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d \u2013 a comment that is as true for her long career as the highest-ranking female official in US history as it is for the nation. It\u2019s unlikely both Trump and Pelosi can survive this power duel. Democrats hope that it will expose Trump as so unfit for office that it will prove fatal to his hopes of reelection. Trump hopes to ignite a backlash against Pelosi, and to use the impeachment drama to inspire his base and more moderate, sympathetic Republicans to a massive turnout in November 2020. Ultimately, if the fight resolves in Trump\u2019s favor, the next election could throw up the historic anomaly of a President who was impeached yet still won a second term. Only two Presidents were impeached in the first 223 years of US history \u2013 Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Neither man was convicted by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned before he was impeached, in the expectation that Congress would oust him for his Watergate crimes. Now there is the possibility impeachment could happen twice in the last 20 years, reflecting the fractured state of a nation split down the middle that has been further polarized by Trump\u2019s presidency. An impeachment inquiry is the ultimate showdown between House Democrats who believe they were handed power in the midterm elections to constrain Trump, and a presidency that has repeatedly ripped democratic norms and tested the Constitution itself. Inside the tangled web of Trump officials and Ukraine's Zelensky At the United Nations, Trump put forward an alternative, retrospective justification for delaying aid to Ukraine ahead of his call to Zelensky on July 25. He said he wanted to wait for European nations to contribute their fair share. Later, the President insisted in a tweet that his decision to provide the declassified, unredacted transcript \u2013 opposed by senior aides \u2013 would show that there was no quid pro quo. \u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\u201d Trump tweeted. In an appearance in Washington, Pelosi warned: \u201cThe President is making lawlessness a virtue in our country.\u201d The House speaker did not specifically commit to an impeachment inquiry in the appearance and it\u2019s possible that the facts of the case will not merit, eventually, a full House vote on the question. But she shifted her position as a political torrent changed the shape of the impeachment debate in Washington. A number of moderate swing-state Democrats who she had been trying to protect moved to the impeachment side of the argument. She said that the nature of Trump\u2019s alleged offense was clear \u2013 a factor that might have changed the political equation. \u201cThis is the most understandable to the public. And It\u2019s really important to know this. There is no requirement there be a quid pro quo in the conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t ask foreign governments to help us in our election. That\u2019s what we try to stop with Russia. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d Pelosi told her caucus that the impeachment would center around six House committees already investigating the President. It would be up to the Judiciary Committee eventually to decide whether to advance Articles of Impeachment. If the full House votes by simple majority to impeach a President his trial then takes place in the Senate. There is so far no suggestion, however, that staunch Republican support for Trump in the GOP-controlled chamber is waning. That means the two-thirds majority that would be needed to convict the President on Articles of Impeachment and to oust him from office looks at this point unlikely to materialize. Like Pelosi, Biden also seems to be calculating his political position. As the subject of Trump\u2019s attacks and the Democratic front-runner, he is in a unique position in the cascading drama. In an on-camera appearance apparently meant to project presidential gravitas and temperament, the former vice president said that if Trump failed to provide information about the case, he would leave lawmakers with no choice. \u201cDenying Congress the information, which it is constitutionally entitled to, and obstructing its efforts to investigate actions is not the conduct of an American president. It\u2019s an abuse of power,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDonald Trump will leave Congress, in my view, no choice but to initiate impeachment. That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,\u201d Biden said. Impeachment \u2013 which can result in a democratic election being overturned \u2013 is the most serious and consequential political maneuver available under the Constitution. It would tear at the fabric of the nation and trigger incalculable results and political forces that could reverberate for years. Trump made the decision to release the whistleblower complaint on Tuesday, a source familiar with the process told CNN. Previously, the White House had pressured acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire not to give it to lawmakers, a step that Democrats say is in itself an infringement of the law. It\u2019s unclear what is behind his change in position, though Pelosi told lawmakers she pressed Trump during a Tuesday phone call to release the complaint. Two White House officials downplayed expectations for any bombshell revelation in the call transcript, saying it is expected to be \u201cunderwhelming.\u201d One of the officials conceded that makes the release of the whistleblower complaint that much more important. But the official raised questions about the credibility of the administration employee who filed the complaint about Trump\u2019s interactions with the Ukrainian President, referring to the employee as \u201cthe so-called whistleblower.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the momentous step of formally opening an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump on a day of stunning and breakneck developments in the Ukraine scandal. The White House is making its own moves, making public a key telephone transcript and preparing to release to Congress a whistleblower\u2019s report as early as Wednesday, according to two sources familiar. Politico first reported the White House\u2019s intention. One source told CNN the whistleblower report is under review and going through declassification and could be released within hours of the transcript release. The investigation will test accusations that Trump sought to pressure a foreign power \u2013 Ukraine \u2013 into effectively intervening in the 2020 election to damage one of his possible Democratic opponents, former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the President\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said in a news conference. \u201cTherefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\u201d Trump lamented the news in that it took the focus off his trip the United Nations General Assembly. \u201cSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!\u201d the President. Her decision elevates the turmoil and division whipped up by Trump\u2019s two-and-half years in power to historic proportions with massive political stakes for the 2020 election and beyond. Pelosi, after months of trying to slow walk impeachment demands from her liberal base, elected to strike, despite the President agreeing to release a transcript on Wednesday of a call with Ukraine\u2019s President. Trump says the document will clear him of wrongdoing despite his public admission that he pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into Biden and his son \u2013 a fact in itself that his opponents argue is a gross abuse of power. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Only two Presidents were impeached in the first 223 years of US history \u2013 Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Now there is the possibility it could happen twice in the last 20 years, reflecting the fractured state of a nation split down the middle that has been further polarized by Trump\u2019s presidency. An impeachment inquiry would be the ultimate showdown between House Democrats who believe they were handed power in the midterm elections to constrain Trump, and a presidency that has repeatedly ripped democratic norms and tested the Constitution itself. Trump says he will release Ukraine phone transcript Tuesday\u2019s developments unfolded at staggering speed in Washington and in New York where the President\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d speech to the United General Assembly was overshadowed. Trump decided to release the transcript under fierce political pressure over claims, first triggered by a whistleblower\u2019s complaint, that he threatened to withhold $400 million in military and security aid to force Kiev to open an investigation into his potential 2020 rival Biden and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence to support claims \u2013 made in public by Trump as recently as Tuesday morning \u2013 that the Bidens had corrupt dealings with the former Soviet Republic. At the United Nations, Trump put forward an alternative, retrospective justification for delaying aid to Ukraine ahead of his call to Zelensky on July 25. He said he wanted to wait for European nations to contribute their fair share. Later, the President insisted in a tweet that his decision to provide the declassified, unredacted transcript \u2013 opposed by senior aides \u2013 would show that there was no quid pro quo offered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\u201d Trump tweeted. Some senior Democrats however insist that there need not be a quid pro quo for Trump to have committed a \u201chigh crime and misdemeanor\u201d needed for a President to be impeached. The simple fact of a President asking a foreign leader to investigate a domestic political opponent is seen by many legal and political commentators as an abuse of power. Nancy Pelosi is expected to announce launch of formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday afternoon In an appearance in Washington, Pelosi warned: \u201cThe President is making lawlessness a virtue in our country.\u201d The House speaker did not specifically commit to an impeachment inquiry in the appearance and it\u2019s possible that the facts of the case will not merit, eventually, a full House vote on the question.

There is so far no suggestion, however, that staunch Republican support for Trump in the GOP controlled chamber is waning.

That would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,\u201d Biden said. Democratic reluctance to move ahead with impeachment, despite what many in the party see as gross abuses of power revealed by special counsel Robert Mueller, has partly been based on fears of igniting Trump\u2019s base and causing a 2020 political backlash. Impeachment \u2013 that can result in a democratic election being overturned \u2013 is the most serious and consequential political maneuver available under the Constitution. It would tear at the fabric of the nation and trigger incalculable results and political forces that could reverberate for years. In another potentially enormous development, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff announced that the whistleblower who filed the complaint about Trump\u2019s conduct, wants to speak to the committee. The whistleblower has requested guidance from acting DNI Joseph Maguire on how to do so, Schiff said. Maguire had been under pressure from the White House and Justice Department not to turn over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, but that appeared to change late Tuesday, so it was not clear how realistic are Democratic hopes of hearing the testimony. Trump made the decision to release the whistleblower complaint on Tuesday, a source familiar told CNN. It\u2019s unclear what is behind his change in position, though Pelosi told lawmakers she pressed Trump during a Tuesday phone call to release the complaint. Two White House officials downplayed expectations for any bombshell revelation in the call transcript, saying it is expected to be \u201cunderwhelming.\u201d One of the officials conceded that makes the release of the whistleblower complaint that much more important.

            "article_content": "The Ukraine scandal raging around Donald Trump is forcing Democrats to confront a fateful choice on impeachment that will not just shape the 2020 election but will echo down the ages. The facts of whether the President pressured Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic general election opponent Joe Biden while a US military aid package was on the table are still obscured. Trump supporters say there is so far no evidence that he offered a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians and note that an intelligence community whistleblower who raised the alarm was operating with a second-hand knowledge of Trump\u2019s conversations. What's going on with Trump and Biden and Ukraine But if Trump used his power to try to coerce a foreign leader into influencing US elections, it could precipitate the worst political crisis of a presidency that has been mired in notoriety from its first hours. It would amount to a situation in which Trump\u2019s team, which according to the Mueller report expected to benefit from Russian election meddling in 2016, is now using the power of the presidency to incite collusion ahead of the 2020 election. That possibility seemed to unlock a shift Sunday in the Democratic position on impeachment. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said on CNN that Trump may have \u201ccrossed the Rubicon.\u201d And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2013 who has been loath to contemplate an impeachment drama \u2013 warned that events might necessitate a \u201cnew stage of investigation.\u201d  Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat on the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs panels, told CNN on Monday morning, \u201cI think we\u2019re reaching a tipping point both within our base and within our caucus.\u201d Republican senators who have strongly supported Trump were largely silent but Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah tweeted Sunday \u201cit would be troubling in the extreme\u201d if Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden and that it is \u201ccritical for the facts to come out.\u201d There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son Hunter. The then-Ukrainian prosecutor general Yury Lutsenko said in May that Burisma Holdings, a major energy company, did not violate Ukrainian law by having Hunter Biden on its board and paying him. Trump\u2019s claims that Biden pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor because he investigated a business for which his son served as a board member have previously been found to be false. The prosecutor was seen as corrupt by multiple governments and international institutions, not just the former vice president. Presidents are expected to act in the interests of all Americans and not to use their vast discretion in foreign policy to pursue political vendettas or subvert US democracy. The Founders saw the presidency as a public trust, meaning that its incumbents should not put their personal interests over the national interest. The Ukraine story is so significant because it may have the potential to fall into such grave constitutional territory and could represent an abuse of presidential power. Trump and his team seemed at odds Sunday over whether to publish the transcript of his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And they went on offense in typical fashion, bending facts and spinning conspiracy theories, obfuscation and hypocrisy. Trump insisted that he said \u201cabsolutely nothing wrong\u201d in the call with the Ukrainian president. \u201cIt was perfect,\u201d he said. Trump often gives the impression that he believes he is not constrained by norms on the limits of power observed by past presidents. In July for instance, he said, falsely, that Article 2 of the Constitution \u201callows me to do whatever I want as President.\u201d Past scrapes like the 2016 Russian election meddling scandal \u2013 and multiple controversies ranging from his insulting behavior toward the late Sen. John McCain to his payments to women who claimed they had affairs with him \u2013 have failed to bring him down. His emergence from each may have taught him a lesson. Trump on Sunday appeared to add new context to the Ukraine story when he said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine\u2019s president at a time when Kiev was awaiting a $250 million military aid package from the United States. The call with Zelensky took place on July 25. Congress passed the bill in August and the White House lifted a hold on the money in September. \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump said. CNN has reported that Trump urged Zelensky to investigate Biden\u2019s son in a call on July 25, but did not discuss a pending aid package at the time, indicating there may not have been an explicit quid pro quo outlined in the conversation. The latest developments highlighted Pelosi\u2019s reluctance to trigger impeachment proceedings against Trump amid fears of a political backlash. But Schiff, a Pelosi ally, suggested things may be about to change. \u201cThis would be an extraordinary remedy, a remedy of last resort and not first resort,\u201d Schiff said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cBut if the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit, providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is co-equal to the evil that that conduct represents.\u201d Pelosi and Schiff were in close coordination throughout the weekend talking about the Ukraine whistleblower story and coordinating strategy, a leadership aide confirmed to CNN. The way that events could force the hands of Democratic leaders became even clearer later on Sunday. Pelosi hinted at a change of strategy in a message to Democratic colleagues, over half of whom had already backed the idea of impeachment. \u201cIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d Pelosi wrote on Sunday. Pelosi has been reluctant to embrace impeachment since Senate Republicans are unlikely to vote to convict the President. There is also no desire to set Trump\u2019s political base alight as Democrats try to keep their House majority in 2020. If Trump\u2019s behavior is exposed as corrupt, Democrats may be forced into impeachment hearings \u2013 whatever the long-term political cost. To do nothing would be to accept that a President can abuse his power by seeking foreign interference in American democracy. Trump would feel validated and emboldened. The balance between Congress and the Presidency will have been fundamentally altered and there will be few checks and balances left capable of constraining Trump and future presidents. Inaction might also be politically unsustainable since Democrats might see their own leaders as willing to use the power of a House majority to defend their own presidential front-runner. Democrats, both freshmen from Trump-won districts and moderates who have resisted calls for impeachment, are telling their colleagues privately they are prepared to announce their support for impeachment proceedings if the controversy continues to grow \u2013 namely if there\u2019s evidence that Trump sought to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigating the Bidens, according to Democratic sources involved in the conversations on Monday morning. That could change the calculus for Pelosi, who has in part resisted because she has sought to protect vulnerable Democrats in GOP-leaning districts who could face voter backlash over impeachment. But if those members come out in support of impeachment proceedings, Pelosi is bound to shift her positioning as well, according to Democrats close to the speaker. Seeking to fog such questions, Trump\u2019s lieutenants went on the offensive on Sunday talk shows using a familiar playbook. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revived debunked questions about Biden\u2019s conduct. \u201cI do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that,\u201d Pompeo said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAmerica cannot have our elections interfered with, and if that\u2019s what took place there, if there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know.\u201d For the administration to make an argument about electoral interference seems somewhat rich, given that Trump has long rejected evidence that Russia intervened in 2016 to help him. On \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was no reason to believe Trump pressured Ukraine, though admitted he wasn\u2019t on the call in question. And he argued that Biden\u2019s son should not have been allowed to do business in Ukraine while his father was vice president. Asked by Jake Tapper Sunday about the glaring inconsistency in this statement since Trump\u2019s children continue to work globally on a business from which the President has not fully divested, Mnuchin dodged. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to go into more of these details,\u201d Mnuchin said. Both Mnuchin and Pompeo opposed releasing transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls, arguing that a President has a right to confidentiality in conversations with foreign leaders. The administration\u2019s efforts to stop acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire from releasing the whistleblower report to Congress, and its opposition to releasing a transcript, are only fueling speculation the White House has something to hide. If there was wrongdoing such conduct could equal obstruction of justice, historically an impeachable offense. Trump, however, said that he hoped they would release the transcript. Biden, meanwhile, spent the weekend defending himself and trying to turn the scandal to his own advantage in a tight primary race. \u201cTrump is doing this because he knows I\u2019ll beat him like a drum and he is using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,\u201d Biden said.

            "article_content": "By the end of Monday, the British government will suspend the country\u2019s Parliament for five weeks \u2013 at the request of newly installed Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It\u2019s part of a broader feud between Johnson and Parliament as the two sides try to figure out how Britain can leave the European Union by October 31. So far, all the fighting has produced is chaos and uncertainty. To sift through all that\u2019s happened \u2013 and what to expect next \u2013 I reached out to my friend Sebastian Payne, a political writer for the Financial Times. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Cillizza: Start on July 24. Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister (as you predicted he would months ago!). How did we go from that day until now, where he is calling for a new election? Payne: Boris became Prime Minister based on a simple pledge of taking the UK out of the EU on October 31 \u2013 \u201ccome what may, do or die,\u201d in his words. That means either with a formal withdrawal agreement, like the treaty former PM Theresa May negotiated, or exiting with no transitional or trading arrangements, a so-called \u201cno-deal Brexit.\u201d Conservative Party members lapped up this tub-thumping approach and he won the leadership contest with a stonking majority. But he did so by boxing himself in, limiting the options for a tweaked version of May\u2019s Brexit deal by demanding changes the EU are unlikely to grant. As soon as Johnson became Prime Minister, the chances of leaving without a deal rose significantly and Parliament was very unhappy about this. The majority of the UK\u2019s 650 MPs in the House of Commons have made it clear through several votes they are against \u201cno deal.\u201d Johnson said he wouldn\u2019t listen to Parliament, as he is focused on delivering on the outcome of the 2016 referendum. A clash between the two sides was inevitable, but it has come around much sooner than anyone expected. What we\u2019re witnessing in Westminster is a constitutional dilemma between an executive, which has no majority, versus a Parliament that is trying to assert itself. Both sides are breaking rule after rule in the UK\u2019s unwritten constitution, which is stoking anger and confusion. When a prime minister has no majority and a Parliament wants to disrupt their agenda, they have little choice but to eventually go to the polls. Some in Johnson\u2019s inner circle predicted Britain would be heading to the polls the day he entered Downing Street. And that\u2019s what is happening, but even that is proving a challenge as MPs are blocking his efforts to dissolve Parliament. Johnson might be in office, but he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s in power. Cillizza: How much did Johnson\u2019s decision to ask the Queen to suspend Parliament take this from a brush fire to a roaring conflagration? Payne: Suspending Parliament, or proroguing, to use the technical term, happens all the time. It is usually for a handful of days after a session has finished and a new legislative term is opened up by the Queen. But Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue it for five weeks \u2013 starting today \u2013 has created so much anger because it is denying MPs critical time to have their say and potentially thwart his Brexit plan. Defenders of the proroguing argue that Parliament was set to break up for the UK\u2019s annual party conference (convention) season anyway, and Boris\u2019 decision to close down Parliament only adds four to six extra days to that traditional break. They say it\u2019s another instance of pro-Remain MPs kicking up a fuss about a trivial matter. But critics argue that MPs were likely to have canceled the usual Parliament break for party conferences, given the gravity of the current crisis. By depriving them of the opportunity to debate and vote on Brexit, Johnson is acting in an undemocratic fashion. Where the critics have a point is that the decision was made with the intention of stopping debate. Leaked court documents showed us that Downing Street made the decision in early August to shut down Parliament and deprive MPs of chances to stop a potential \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit. In essence: What he has done in absolutely legal, but it has broken the spirit and conventions that define British politics. Cillizza: Why does Johnson feel SO strongly about the need for a \u201cNo deal Brexit?\u201d And why does Parliament so strongly oppose that idea? Payne: Johnson has concluded, not without reason, that if he doesn\u2019t deliver Brexit on October 31 then his party is finished and millions of voters will lose faith in British democracy. It was Conservatives who wanted the referendum, Conservatives who campaigned for Brexit and Conservatives who have tried (and failed so) to deliver it. They are now the party of Brexit and if Boris doesn\u2019t deliver it this time, the British electorate is unlikely to forgive them. The Johnson government has concluded that the UK will leave, even if it means without a trade deal which most experts say will lead to significant economic and trading disruption. At the least, a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit will create significant traffic jams around the UK\u2019s major ports, chaos at transport links and lead to increased food prices and less choice. At worst, it could mean civil unrest and the army having to deliver fuel around the country. As one Conservative MP said to me recently, \u201cit would be the first time in modern history that a country has imposed sanctions on itself.\u201d For all those reasons and more, Parliament thinks a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit is a dumb idea and will plunge the country into a recession. The Conservative rebels think their party will never be forgiven for such damage to the economy. They want to stop it and are hoping to force Boris\u2019 hand by passing legislation last week to push him to go back to the EU and request another delay instead of leaving on October 31. In turn, Downing Street has hinted it will declare a national emergency (heard that before?) or just ignore the law. The constitutional crisis is ratcheting up every day. Cillizza: Is there any real chance that Johnson gets his wish for an early election? Is that, in fact, what he wants? And if there is an election, might he lose? Payne: The Prime Minister is going to try again for an election today, but MPs don\u2019t want it right now. Two-thirds of MPs have voted to dissolve Parliament to have an early election, and the opposition MPs from Labour and the Scottish nationalists aren\u2019t on board. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to see his wish granted this week. But when parliament returns on October 14 after suspension, there will be another chance to collapse his government \u2013 especially if the Prime Minister ignores their request to seek another Brexit delay. I\u2019ve heard rumors from senior officials in Downing Street that their ideal time for an election would be the first couple of days of November, soon after October 31 to take advantage of the bounce of finally leaving the EU but avoiding the potential chaos. Johnson is sincere in not wanting an election right now, but he has concluded there is no other choice if he wants to deliver Brexit by October 31. He knows that the British electorate is *incredibly* volatile at the moment and he is far from assured of winning a majority. He would prefer to wait until Brexit is resolved. But either way, Johnson has a working majority of -43. You can\u2019t govern with that for a long time. Whether it happens now, next month or in November, the UK will have an election before the end of the year. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: The one BIG thing to watch in the next week as a sign of where all of this is headed is _____________.\u201d Now, explain. Payne: \u201cDoes Boris Johnson have serious proposals for a new Brexit deal?\u201d The Prime Minister insists he still wants the UK to leave with a Brexit deal on October 31 and I think he\u2019s genuinely focused on leaving in an orderly fashion. Yet so far, his team has yet to come up with serious proposals beyond vague platitudes. And time is running out to strike a new deal before his October 31 deadline. May\u2019s Brexit deal, which is still on the table, tried and failed to pass Parliament three times so there is no point in bringing it back again. The question is whether there are realistic changes that can be sought over the next couple of weeks Johnson can live with; that keep his party content; and the EU will accept. If so, the UK will Brexit on October 31 in an orderly fashion. If not, then expect even more chaos ahead.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic field has flocked to New Hampshire as the first-in-the-nation primary that may be even more pivotal than usual grabs the spotlight for the first time in the 2020 campaign. Nineteen candidates are addressing the state\u2019s Democratic Party convention Saturday, five months before voters deliver judgments that that will change the shape of the race. It marks a crucial beginning, since many voters are only beginning to make up their minds as summer loosens its grip. The primary is looming as a clash between the senators of New Hampshire\u2019s neighboring states, Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders \u2013 who thumped Hillary Clinton here in 2016 \u2013 and Massachusetts\u2019 Elizabeth Warren. Their confrontation could help decide which of them gets to carry the dreams of the party\u2019s most progressive voters as the race expands beyond less diverse early voting states. New Hampshire\u2019s primary could also provide a hope of redemption for Joe Biden should he underperform in the Iowa caucuses. But front-runners mustn\u2019t lose, so it\u2019s possible the former vice president may be face a win or bust scenario here. If he stumbles, the state could usher alternative moderates like Kamala Harris, Cory Booker or Pete Buttigieg into contention. As fall approaches, the dominant theme of the primary is already clear: Candidates are learning at town halls, ice cream socials and in their selfie lines that New Hampshire Democrats are taking their responsibility especially seriously this time. The question of electability is palpable as activists fixate on finding the nominee who has the best chance against Trump. Sanders built a movement on being an outsider. But his thumping 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton here \u2014 he won 60% of the vote \u2014 means he\u2019s the established political power. The Vermont senator sent a message of intent by blitzing the state over the Labor Day weekend and into the week. \u201cWe take nothing for granted, we are going to work as hard we can, in city after city in this great state,\u201d he vowed, as the sun beat down on a crowd of Sanders devotees in the courtyard at a community college in Nashua on Tuesday. \u201cWe intend to win here in New Hampshire again.\u201d No one expects Sanders to hit 60% again, especially given that the field may still be unwieldy when New Hampshire votes. And he may have his hands full with Warren. Like Sanders, Warren incites a revolt against corporate money\u2019s corrupting influence in Washington. But her willingness to lay bare her own early personal and economic struggles distinguishes Warren from a rival who largely abhors personal storytelling. \u201cNew Hampshire is vital to both in terms of their chances of success,\u201d said Dante Scala, a political science professor and long time primary watcher at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a scenario where Warren loses New Hampshire then goes on to win the nomination.\u201d Sanders\u2019 nationwide support means an early loss in New England is not likely to end his campaign. \u201cBut \u2026 obviously he wants to win New Hampshire, too if he wants to win the nomination,\u201d Scala said. Sanders, thanks to his previous campaign\u2019s grassroots work, has a network of thousands of volunteers and a power base among young and blue collar voters in New Hampshire. He\u2019s making his seventh visit to the state this weekend since announcing his campaign, and has six field offices and 45 paid staff. \u201cI think we have more volunteers than any other campaigns,\u201d he said, pressing home his advantage while marching in a Labor Day parade in Milford, New Hampshire. But Warren is building a formidable operation herself, with six field offices in the state. Saturday makes her 16th visit since January. Her \u201cselfie\u201d lines are becoming an iconic image of a campaign animated by her apparently limitless energy. Warren\u2019s strong summer means she faces the same question wherever she goes: When will she bust her progressive truce with Sanders? On Monday, as she huddled away from a rainstorm under a backyard terrace umbrella in Hampton Falls, Warren refused to fray the message discipline that has so far defined her campaign. \u201cBernie and I have been friends for many, many years, long before I ever got in politics and I don\u2019t see any reason this should change,\u201d said Warren, peering out from under a \u201cMake Earth Cool Again\u201d baseball cap. \u201cI get out every day and try to meet as many voters as I can and talk about why I\u2019m in this race, to talk about my vision, to talk about what\u2019s broken, to talk about my plans to fix it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m building a grassroots movement to get it done. I think that\u2019s what voters want to hear.\u201d Her comment is revealing of Warren\u2019s strategy: There\u2019s no need for to attack Sanders or anyone else right now. She\u2019s basking in good press, introducing herself to voters and has a campaign on the rise. But rivals jealous of her buzz will soon start to more seriously to probe her record and capacity to enact her sweeping policy plans. Strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire would confirm Warren as a potential nominee. But failure could doom her hopes of using early contests as a springboard to expand her constituency to minority and working class voters in the South and Midwest. Biden is under pressure to quickly ramp up in New Hampshire. As he landed in the state on Friday, the former vice president unveiled endorsements from two former state party chairs, Michael King and Chris Spirou. After all, neither of his previous presidential campaigns even made it past Iowa. Given that the primary is open to independents, his more moderate message should get a hearing. A double win in Iowa and New Hampshire could set up a domino effect to wrap up the nomination. A win in either could see him through to the South Carolina primary where he\u2019s strong. But early state losses could buckle the argument on which he\u2019s built his campaign \u2013 that he\u2019s the most likely Democrat to beat Trump. Comments by a senior Biden aide this week were taken as a warning sign in many quarters. \u201cDo we think we have to win Iowa? No. Do we want to win Iowa? Yes, we do. We think we\u2019re going to win; we know it\u2019s going to be a dogfight. The same thing is true in New Hampshire,\u201d the senior campaign aide said. The veteran Democrat is currently making his fifth trip to New Hampshire since announcing in April. He has more than 45 staffers in the state and five field offices in addition to his Granite State headquarters. Biden also isn\u2019t alone in the moderate lane. Buttigieg, for instance, just announced a New Hampshire expansion with 12 new office openings, bringing his total footprint in the Granite State to 56 people. On a balmy Labor Day Eve, Ben Cohen, the ice cream magnate and co-founder of Ben and Jerry\u2019s was bouncing around a stage in the old mill town of Dover. \u201cBernie beats Trump! Bernie beats Trump! Bernie beats Trump!\u201d Cohen chanted, drawing smiles from a pro-Sanders crowd. Cohen is a longtime fan of his fellow Vermont institution, but his histrionics revealed a key dynamic in New Hampshire. The primary is marinating in national themes \u2014 an economy weighted toward the rich, health care and college costs and debt and climate change. And candidates are careful to note flaring local concerns, including the opioid crisis. But the shock of Trump\u2019s presidency has concentrated minds of Democratic activists who are considering the relative chances of each candidate of beating him. Sanders cites match-up polls showing him beating the President in his events \u2014 though other candidates tend to do just as well. He brandishes his whopping win here in 2016 and the resonance of his ideas ever since \u2013 like his campaign to raise the minimum wage \u2013 as proof his self-described socialism is not the recipe for a general election disaster his critics think. \u201cI want to thank the people of New Hampshire very much. When I came here four years ago, many of the ideas I that talked about were described by the media \u2026 the political establishment as radical ideas. Yet four years later, many of those ideas are now mainstream, and are supported by many of my Democratic opponents,\u201d Sanders said in Nashua, echoing other stops elsewhere on the campaign trail. Warren parries similar questions about nagging fears that after Clinton\u2019s loss in a brutal campaign against Trump, a safer choice might be a white, male, traditional candidate. Posing the first question at Warren\u2019s Labor Day event that drew 800 people, liberal activist Linda Rhodes hit on the most existential question facing her campaign. \u201cOne of the things that concerns me is when I talk to friends and family and people all over the country they say, \u2018I love Elizabeth Warren. We love her policies, but can she really beat Donald Trump?\u2019\u201d Rhodes said. Warren\u2019s answer was for her entire campaign: \u201cHow about we start with I know how to fight and I know how to win? Yeah!\u201d \u201cI think what\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe. It\u2019s not pretending that everything was just fine and then here\u2019s this one problem and we get rid of that one problem, it\u2019s all going to work out. Because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not.\u201d CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer, Sarah Mucha, Jeff Zeleny, Eric Bradner, Maeve Reston, Daniella Diaz and Ryan Nobles contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "After Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson announced Wednesday he was resigning his seat at the end of the year, it took less than an hour for the state\u2019s Republican machinery to spin into action. It\u2019s up to Brian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, to appoint Isakson\u2019s replacement, and for a state that\u2019s been in GOP hands for nearly two decades, there\u2019s no shortage of candidates vying for the role. News of Isakson\u2019s retirement was quick to circulate among politicos at a Chamber of Commerce event at the Atlanta Braves\u2019 SunTrust Park on Wednesday morning. One veteran Republican operative, Eric Tanenblatt, stepped out to take a call from a reporter. He wasn\u2019t alone. As he sat in the empty stadium seats, Tanenblatt noticed several other connected Republicans had also stepped out and were on their phones, either speaking quickly into the receivers or furiously texting. READ: Johnny Isakson resignation letter from US Senate Georgia Republicans spent much of Wednesday doing two things: emphasizing how important it was to honor and commemorate Isakson\u2019s long career before considering who might come next \u2013 and then trading gossip, rumors and news about who might fill the role. By the end of the day, more than a dozen names were being floated as possible appointees. The shadow primary to be Georgia\u2019s next Republican senator was underway. Within minutes of Isakson\u2019s announcement, a consensus shortlist formed. On it, according to multiple GOP operatives familiar with Georgia, are state attorney general Chris Carr, Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, and Georgia\u2019s current lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan. Carr was chief of staff for Isakson for six years. His wife Joan currently has the same job. Duncan on the other hand is seen by many to have a close relationship with Kemp. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a dozen more you could add to that list,\u201d said Tanenblatt, who by the end of the day was also being floated as a potential choice, according to one Republican operative. When asked by CNN if he would accept the job, Tanenblatt, a former chief of staff to then Gov. Sonny Perdue, denied he was \u201cvying for anything.\u201d Another popular name, Nick Ayers, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, quickly popped his own trial balloon. Even before he left the White House this year to return to his home state, there were whispers that Ayers was interested in running for governor. But in a statement Wednesday afternoon (preempted by a lengthy paragraph of praise for Isakson), Ayers shut the door on accepting an appointment to the Senate. Young, rich and loyal: The rising GOP star who passed on becoming Trump's chief of staff \u201cGovernor Kemp has a number of great options to choose from who will represent our state with success and distinction \u2014 but I won\u2019t be one of them,\u201d Ayers said. Reelected in 2016, Isakson will have only filled out half of his six-year term when he resigns on December. State law requires a special election to be held the following November to finish the term. Kemp\u2019s appointee will likely have a built-in advantage in the 2020 special election, but it will hardly be the only competitive election in the Peach State next year. How the surprise resignation of Johnny Isakson could change the 2020 Senate math There\u2019s incumbent Republican senator David Perdue\u2019s reelection bid. Two congressional districts in the metro Atlanta suburbs, one held by each party, are already top targets for the other party. Every seat in the state general assembly, currently controlled by the GOP, is up for reelection. And then there\u2019s the presidential race, where Democrats are hoping Donald Trump\u2019s relative unpopularity with swing voters can prove Georgia is a purple, not red, state. \u201cThe Democrats have made it no secret they will compete in Georgia,\u201d said Charlie Harper, a Georgia-based Republican consultant and political writer. \u201cThis (the special election) gives them yet another prize to go after.\u201d The stakes are bigger than a mere seat in the US Senate. Instead, the choice to replace Isakson may be a test for the Republican Party in Georgia, a red state that has been teetering on the brink of turning purple. As in many states, the Georgia GOP finds itself split between two factions \u2013 a conservative, pro-Trump wing and a business-aligned \u201cChamber of Commerce\u201d wing. While Kemp ran in 2018 as a pro-Trump, gun-toting, tough-on-immigrants conservative, his victory was the narrowest for a Republican governor since Sonny Perdue\u2019s win in 2002. Democrat Stacey Abrams came within 55,000 votes (less than two percentage points) of upsetting him. Perhaps in recognition of the changing politics, Kemp\u2019s been more temperate in his governance. Among his appointments, for instance, are the state\u2019s first Hispanic insurance commissioner and two black women judges on the courts in two Atlanta suburban counties, Cobb and Gwinnett. Kemp may need to make a similar calculation with his selection to replace Isakson, who gained a reputation as a relative moderate within the GOP. As one Georgia Republican put it to CNN, an ideal appointee might be one that can appeal to suburban women who have been turned off by Trump\u2019s influence on the Republican Party. The right choice from Kemp to replace Isakson could put Republicans in a good position to prevent a Democratic foothold in Georgia. The wrong choice could not only make the special election competitive but galvanize Democrats to push their position in Atlanta\u2019s growing and diversifying suburbs, where the GOP lost considerable ground in the 2018 midterms. There are implications for Kemp himself. Whichever party controls the state\u2019s general assembly after next fall\u2019s elections will determine new congressional apportionment following the 2020 census. More favorable districts for Democrats in 2022 means more potential footholds \u2013 in a year when Kemp will be up for reelection. \u201cMy desire would be to use this as an opportunity to broaden our base,\u201d Tanenblatt said. The problem, according to another Georgia GOP operative, is that much of the GOP\u2019s bench, after years of total control, remains populated by \u201cold white guys.\u201d But selecting a replacement for Isakson who lacks appeal with the GOP\u2019s conservative faithful could be just as dangerous. The special election will be a \u201cjungle primary,\u201d meaning any number of candidates from either party can qualify for the ballot. The risk is that the incumbent Republican that Kemp appoints could have to fend off challengers from both the Democratic Party and his own. \u201cThis is where you\u2019re really going to get to see Brian Kemp\u2019s vision for the state,\u201d Harper said.",

            "article_content": "Just five candidates accounted for roughly three-quarters of all the money raised in the second quarter of this year by Democratic presidential contenders \u2013 as a crowded field broke into two distinct categories: the haves and the have-nots. Leading those flush with cash: Pete Buttigieg, a mayor little-known outside his home state of Indiana before his sure-footed media appearances in the spring and cross-country fundraising tours persuaded deep-pocketed Democratic donors to open their wallets. Buttigieg raised nearly $25 million in the April-to-June fundraising quarter. And he entered July \u2013 typically a slow fundraising period as donors turn to vacation plans and away from politics \u2013 with more than $22.7 million remaining in his bank account, one of the field\u2019s biggest war chests. He\u2019s already using the money to build a ground force of more than 250 staffers in early voting states. The other four candidates in the top fundraising tier: former Vice President Joe Biden, who collected nearly $22 million, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at $19.2 million, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at $18 million and California Sen. Kamala Harris with $11.8 million But the vast majority of the field failed to break the $5 million mark during the three-month period, newly filed Federal Election Commission reports show. That spells trouble for Democrats hoping to compete next year in an Iowa caucus system that requires money and organization months in advance, said Ami Copeland, a former deputy finance director for the Obama campaign. \u201cWhen you are running a campaign based on $2.8 million or $4 million and are going up against a $15 million to $20 million juggernaut, it\u2019s just hard to penetrate,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe demands of a campaign operation are way too great today.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more candidates drop out before the end of the next quarter,\u201d Copeland added. Former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who shattered political money records in his near-miss Senate campaign in 2018, saw his fundraising plummet as a presidential candidate. He raised just $3.6 million in the second quarter \u2013 down from $9.4 million in the first 18 days of his campaign earlier this year. He also spent far more than he took in, plowing more than $5.3 million into his political operation. About $1 in $5 of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s dollars went to payroll costs. In an email to supporters Monday night, O\u2019Rourke campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon bluntly acknowledged that fundraising needed to increase. \u201cWe have the resources we need to be in this for the long haul, but if we don\u2019t raise more this quarter, we\u2019ll have no choice but to make some adjustments,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote. Sanders outspent the rest of the Democratic field over the three-month period, spending roughly $14 million \u2013 including $3 million directed to salaries. Biden, running in his first presidential race since 2008, racked up $11 million in expenses, including more than $250,000 with a private jet operator based in Arlington, Virginia. Warren has sworn off big fundraising events or courting deep-pocketed donors. But the glitterati have found their way into her campaign. Hollywood A-listers who contributed the maximum $2,800 primary donation to Warren included TV drama guru Shonda Rhimes and actress Jane Fonda. Barbra Streisand donated $1,000 to the Massachusetts senator. Even so, small donations of $200 or less still powered Warren\u2019s campaign, accounting for two-thirds of her individual contributions between April and June. Another candidate, Julian Castro, raised even a greater share of his money from small donors, a little more than 74%. President Donald Trump built his 2016 campaign on small donors and still spends heavily to reach his grassroots base. But his campaign and joint fundraising committees he operates with the Republican National Committee also increasingly are relying on big donors to fuel his re-election. Together, four related Trump entities \u2013 including the national party \u2013 announced raising a combined $108 million during the second quarter. Donors who contributed $360,600 apiece to his Trump Victory fund included Wisconsin roofing magnate Diane Hendricks; Marlene Ricketts, the wife of TD Ameritrade founder J. Joe Rickett; and Linda McMahon, who served as Trump\u2019s Small Business Administration chief before leaving to raise money for a pro-Trump super PAC. Trump Victory shares its money with the President\u2019s campaign, the RNC and state parties. Some freshman Democrats in Congress are raising substantial sums, newly filed campaign reports show. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 at the center of a firestorm over Trump tweets telling her and three other women of color in Congress to \u201cgo back\u201d where they came from \u2013 raised a whopping $1.2 million in three months as she looks ahead to reelection in 2020. It\u2019s an amount that eclipsed the second-quarter hauls of some Democratic presidential candidates including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Nearly 84% of her donations came in small amounts, a sign that she can tap those donors repeatedly before hitting the $2,800 limit on what an individual can donate to a primary or general election. The filings show that 11 Democratic candidates \u2013 all outside the top five \u2013 posted unsustainable burn rates, as they spent more than they raised in the second quarter. Highest among those was New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand with a burn rate of nearly 184% as she spent $4.2 million. Gillibrand has a sizable $8.2 million cash-on-hand reserve, padded by pre-existing funds from her Senate campaign account. But with only $2.3 million raised in the quarter, the campaign can\u2019t keep spending at that rate. O\u2019Rourke and Hickenlooper posted burn rates of over 140% \u2013 particularly problematic for Hickenlooper, who only has a little over $836,000 cash on hand entering the third quarter \u2013 while New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard all spent more last quarter than they brought in. Marianne Williamson spent almost exactly as much as she raised in the quarter, about $1.5 million. Candidates like Booker and Klobuchar have large enough cash reserves to weather the heavy spending. But many candidates, even those who didn\u2019t spend more than they raised, are entering the third quarter with limited resources. Eight candidates posted cash on hand totals of less than $1 million, including Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and businessman Andrew Yang.

            "article_content": "Former Rep. Jan Meyers, the first Republican woman to represent Kansas in the House, died Friday, daughter Valerie Meyers told CNN on Tuesday. The younger Meyers said her mother died of heart complications. The Kansas Republican is remembered for her unwavering fiscal conservatism, but also for her occasionally progressive social stances that would put her at odds with her party. Meyers\u2019 support for the pro-choice movement and gun control was considered unusual for Republicans, especially during her congressional tenure in the 1980s and \u201990s Meyers\u2019 political views were centered on her passion for women\u2019s issues and including women in politics, according to Michael Murray, her former chief of staff. \u201cJan Meyers was a pioneer in the movement for more women to hold public office,\u201d Murray said. \u201cShe was on the vanguard of that entire movement.\u201d Meyers\u2019 political career began as a member of the Overland Park City Council, before serving in the Kansas State Senate for more than a decade. In 1984, she announced her campaign to run for Kansas\u2019 3rd Congressional District seat, representing the smallest district of the state\u2019s four, an election that she won. In the first few years after Meyers took office in 1985, she served on the Committee on Science and Technology and the Foreign Affairs Committee. However, the committee in which Meyers truly left her mark was the Small Business Committee. As a member, she demonstrated her fiscal conservatism through her push to decrease taxes for small businesses, exempt them from minimum wage laws and decrease health care deductions for the self-employed to 100%, according to her House biography. When Republicans took control of the House in 1994, she became the chair of the Small Business Committee, which made her the first Republican to chair that committee since 1955. Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, the current chair of the committee, fondly remembered her time working under Meyers. \u201cJan Meyers was a trailblazer who often worked across the aisle and, most importantly, strived to put her constituents\u2019 interests first,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez told CNN in a statement. \u201cWhile we came from different parties and didn\u2019t agree on every issue, I always admired her passion, honesty and steadfast dedication to public service. I\u2019ll certainly hold all her friends and family members in my thoughts.\u201d In 1996, Meyers decided not to run for reelection, and her 12-year run in Congress ended in 1997. Current Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts said the impact that Meyers made stays with him today. \u201cCongresswoman Meyers was a trusted colleague, but most importantly a friend. I always looked up to Jan and depended on her advice and counsel during my time serving alongside her in Congress,\u201d Roberts said in a statement. \u201cShe was kind, caring, honest and extremely well respected in not only the 3rd District, but the entire state.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign raised more than $30 million in the first fundraising quarter of 2019 \u2013 an amount that rivals the combined fundraising haul of the top two Democrats in the first quarter and underscores his enormous financial head start over the crowded field of Democrats jockeying to face him in 2020. Trump\u2019s re-election effort now has a substantial $40.8 million remaining in the bank, Tim Murtaugh, the campaign\u2019s director of communications, told CNN on Sunday. In an unprecedented move, Trump\u2019s campaign also has merged its operations with the Republican National Committee, giving the president\u2019s campaign operatives a leading role in guiding field operations, well ahead of the general election. The RNC raised $45.8 million during January-to-March fundraising period and, together with Trump\u2019s campaign and affiliated committees, started April with $82 million in available funds, the committee announced Monday. While Trump and the RNC build a massive war chest, 18 Democrats \u2013 with more considering bids \u2013 will spend heavily to compete for their party\u2019s nomination. \u201cOur prodigious fundraising is further proof of President Trump\u2019s clear record of accomplishment on behalf of the American people,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \u201cThe President is in a vastly stronger position at this point than any previous incumbent president running for re-election, and only continues to build momentum.\u201d Among Democrats, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders leads fundraising with $18.2 million raised during a shorter window than Trump, 41 days. In the No. 2 fundraising slot: California Sen. Kamala Harris with $12 million. Sanders, making his second bid for the presidency, has the biggest war chest of the Democratic field, ending March with $28 million remaining in the bank. Trump\u2019s \u201cstrategy is to raise as much money as possible and to control the national conversation,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan political analysis site, Inside Elections. But Gonzales and Democratic strategists say the total fundraising picture for Democrats shows the party\u2019s donors remain energized and will plow big sums into the general-election battle. \u201cI don\u2019t think this presidential race is going to be decided by money,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cThe president\u2019s going to have plenty of money, and the Democratic nominee will have plenty of money.\u201d The 10 Democrats who have announced first-quarter fundraising numbers so far have collected a combined $79.6 million \u2013 already surpassing the $65.6 million the entire Democratic presidential field had collected during the early months of the 2016 election cycle. Even more Democratic totals will come Monday when candidates file reports with the Federal Election Commission. Another sign of Democratic donor enthusiasm: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who exceeded expectations with a $7 million first-quarter haul for his exploratory committee, raised $1 million within hours of formally launching his presidential campaign on Sunday, his spokeswoman Lis Smith announced on Twitter \u201cThe momentum is clearly on the left,\u201d said Jon Soltz, president of VoteVets, a progressive group. \u201cDemocratic money will consolidate\u201d behind the party\u2019s nominee in 2020. Trump, who built his unorthodox 2016 campaign on online, small-dollar donors, never stopped running for office. He filed his paperwork for re-election on the day he took the oath of office in January 2017. He continues to tap grassroots donors for support. His campaign said that nearly 99% of donations were $200 or less, with an average contribution of $34.26. The committee said it plans to use Trump\u2019s early financial advantage to reach tens of millions of voters to drive home pro-Trump messages while Democrats battle over their choice. And the party said it plans to spend nearly $30 million to grow its lists of supports ahead of 2020. Trump\u2019s campaign and affiliated committees already have drawn 100,000 new online donors this year, the RNC said. Trump\u2019s first-quarter haul exceeds the $21 million his campaign and affiliated committees brought in during the last three months of 2018. But it does not set records for a presidential fundraising quarter. President Barack Obama, the last president to seek re-election, did not begin collecting money in earnest for his re-election until April 2011, and had less than $2 million in available cash at this point in the 2016 campaign. But he went on raise nearly $47 million during the first three months of actively campaigning for a second term.",

            "article_content": "The State Department on Thursday announced that a former Fox News reporter would lead its agency in charge of efforts to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. Lea Gabrielle will become the special envoy and coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, State Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino announced during the department press briefing. \u201cLea will provide the permanent leadership we have needed to bolster the Global Engagement Center\u2019s operations. And she will begin her duties on Monday. Lea is a former CIA-trained human intelligence operations officer, defense foreign liaison officer, United States Navy program director, Navy FA-18/C fighter pilot, and national television news correspondent and anchor at two different networks,\u201d Palladino said. CNN reported in September that Gabrielle was a top contender for the job. Gabrielle could not be immediately reached for comment. Gabrielle was a general assignment reporter for \u201cShepard Smith Reporting,\u201d according to her Fox News biography, and was previously a military reporter. US-German tensions spike over terror suspect dispute Gabrielle is a United States Naval Academy graduate and served in the US Navy as fighter pilot for more than a decade, as well as taking part in some intelligence operations. She has said that her time in the Navy made her a better reporter. \u201cI know how important it is that those who wear combat boots have their voices heard and their perspectives understood in news reporting,\u201d Gabrielle said during a 2016 interview with fightersweep.com. \u201cMy goal as I report on military topics is always to honor them \u2026 by getting it right.\u201d In 2018, she criticized Trump on air over his plans for a military parade in Washington, calling the idea \u201ccompletely unnecessary.\u201d The GEC was established in April 2016, and its mission includes \u201ccountering the adverse effects of state-sponsored propaganda and disinformation.\u201d It has taken on increasing importance as experts warn of the potential for massive disinformation campaigns heading into the midterm elections. When Gabrielle\u2019s name was first floated for the position in September, the choice of a relative foreign policy novice was criticized by several current and former officials with experience in the field. But the Trump administration has shown an appetite for choosing leaders with military experience. Recently Andrea Thompson, who spent more than 25 years in the US military, also joined the State Department as the Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security just last year. The administration has hired a number of former Fox News employees in prominent roles. Heather Nauert, the State Department spokesperson, and the Bill Shine, the White House Communications chief, also worked at the network. Gabrielle will take on the role during a critical time, as the US continues to grapple with the influence of targeted disinformation campaigns. As recently as last week, the Justice Department alleged that Russia has continued pushing online disinformation to discredit the American government, after a pro-Russian Twitter account spread confidential information from a criminal case that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team brought against a Russian company for social media conspiracy. US exit from missile treaty heightens fears of a dangerous arms race The GEC has been strongly criticized during the Trump administration for not actively taking on Russian interference, and for not using all of the money it has been given. Last year the State Department launched a $40 million dollar initiative to counter Russia election interference and disinformation. The funds came to State from the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. But it is unclear how much of that initiative has yet been carried out, and how much of the total funding has been made accessible to the GEC office. One administration official said the extent of Gabrielle\u2019s policy experience is unclear, but they believe she will be an effective spokesperson. The official said that the choice demonstrates the administration sees the job as more a public affairs role than a policy heavy one. Obama\u2019s pick for director of the GEC, Michael Lumpkin, had served as the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict and as the acting under secretary of defense for policy, the third-highest civilian job at the United States Department of Defense. Current acting director Daniel Kimmage has served in several State Department roles, including being principal deputy coordinator of the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. Kimmage, who is fluent in Russian and Arabic, according to his biography, was also a senior fellow at the Homeland Security Policy Institute. His writings include reports on extremist media strategies. Brett Bruen, a former White House director of global engagement during the Obama administration, said, \u201cLea may be a great reporter and pilot. She has evidenced absolutely no knowledge of or experience with information warfare. Our nation, indeed the world, faces a serious and sophisticated threat. We need leadership that can take on this danger from day one.\u201d He added: \u201cHer appointment endangers our elections, our public discourse, and potentially our economy.\u201d CNN\u2019s Michael Conte and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump sat down in the Oval Office for an interview with the conservative website the Daily Caller. To their great credit, the Daily Caller released the full transcript of the conversation, allowing me to go through it line-by-line \u2013 picking out the most, uh, interesting lines from the President. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cHe was a gambler, you know, you don\u2019t see too many gamblers that have money.\u201d Trump is referring to Stephen Paddock, the man who murdered 58 people in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017. (The FBI closed its investigation into the shooting earlier this week without offering a conclusion on Paddock\u2019s motivation.) Paddock was both a gambler and wealthy, Trump says. And away we go! THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 2. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve stayed out of that whole situation so that \u2013 because there was no collusion whatsoever.\u201d What \u201csituation\u201d is Trump referring to here? The question he was asked by the Daily Caller was whether he felt comfortable with the manner in which his one-time adviser Roger Stone was arrested last week. Does Trump mean he has stayed out of commenting on that arrest? Stayed away from Roger Stone? Stayed out of the Russia investigation? He has, of course, not stayed out of anything with the possible exception of not offering a stream of commentary on Stone\u2019s arrest. One thing worth mentioning here, too: NO COLLUSION. 3. \u201cI\u2019m speaking for a lot of people that were very disappointed to see that go down that way, to see it happen where it was on camera, on top of it. That was a very, very disappointing scene.\u201d On the Stone arrest question, \u201cdisappointing\u201d is an odd word choice here. To be clear: The indictment that led to Stone\u2019s arrest alleged that he had repeatedly lied to Congress about his contacts with WikiLeaks over emails stolen from Democrats by Russians \u2013 and that he had urged other witnesses to lie to Congress about what they knew of the situation too. 4. \u201cYou have 29 people and you have armored vehicles and you had all of the other and, you know, many people know Roger, and Roger is not a person that they would have to worry about from that standpoint. I thought it was sad to see it.\u201d What\u2019s remarkable about this \u2013 and the fact that Trump in the next sentence says he would consider asking the FBI to look into its use of force in the Stone arrest \u2013 is that the President has repeatedly urged law enforcement to be tougher in its dealings with criminals. \u201cWhen you see these thugs thrown into the back of a paddy wagon. You see them thrown in, rough. I said, \u2018Please don\u2019t be too nice,\u2019\u201d Trump said in a speech to police officers in 2017. 5. \u201cI guess they\u2019re well over 30 million dollars now on this Russian collusion hoax, and everybody knows it\u2019s a hoax. They\u2019ve spent all this money. Nothing. No phone calls, no meetings, no nothing.\u201d Trump\u2019s not that far off-base on the price tag \u2013 $25 million has been spent on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe since it began in May 2017, according to the most recent filings. Where he REALLY misses the fact boat is in claiming that the Mueller probe has produced zero tangible results. To date, the investigation has produced 199 criminal counts against 37 people and entities. Seven people have pleaded guilty and four have been sentenced to prison. One \u2013 Paul Manafort \u2013 has been convicted by a jury of his peers. That\u2019s not nothing. 6. \u201cYou look at it, and you say, isn\u2019t that sad to have devoted this time, this energy over a \u2013 you know, look, there\u2019s been numerous books written right now, including number one best sellers, calling it a \u2018hoax.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s referring to \u201cThe Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\u201d by Gregg Jarrett. Jarrett is a Fox News personality. Draw your own conclusions. 7. \u201cI would say that I think after almost two years it certainly should be.\u201d Trump is saying here that the Mueller probe has gone on too long already. By way of context, the special counsel investigations into Iran-Contra and Whitewater lasted more than six years each. 8. \u201cProcess crimes or process, you know, questions, the answer is different than what you thought it might be and some people say they lost their memory or a lack of memory, which a lot of people can understand that too.\u201d Trump is right that, to date, all of the crimes related to the 2016 campaign that Mueller has found have been people lying to Congress or federal investigators about who knew what when about contacts between the campaign and Russia. But here\u2019s the thing: 1) The investigation isn\u2019t over yet and 2) WHY WHY WHY are all these people in Trump\u2019s orbit willing to lie to federal authorities about their contacts with the Russians? 9. \u201cI could\u2019ve taken a much different stance, I could\u2019ve gotten involved in this, I could\u2019ve terminated everything. I could\u2019ve ended everything. I\u2019ve chosen to stay out of it.\u201d Two thoughts here. First, it\u2019s not at all clear that Trump could have \u201cterminated\u201d the Mueller probe. Second, this past 20 months is what \u201cstay[ing] out of it\u201d looks like for Donald Trump, eh? 10. \u201cI ran a great campaign. I ran a campaign that now they say was better than that gentleman\u2019s [Andrew Jackson\u2019s] campaign in the 1800s and we did a great job.\u201d They say that, do they?

In this case, he\u2019s blaming former House Speaker Paul Ryan for lying to him about wall funding in order to secure his signature on an omnibus spending bill. 13. \u201cAnd then he went lame duck. And once he went lame duck it was just really an exercise in waving to people and the power was gone, so I was very disappointed.\u201d Rather than saying \u201cretired,\u201d I propose we say \u201cwent lame duck\u201d in the future. As in: \u201cHey, did Cillizza leave CNN? No, he went lame duck. He and his wife are living up in the Catskills now.\u201d 14. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say he lied.

As PBS\u2019 Yamiche Alcindor noted on Twitter: \u201cPresident Trump keeps saying, \u2018The wall is getting built.\u2019 Fact check: This is false. No construction has begun on the wall President Trump promised. The President said he would be going to a \u201cground-breaking\u2019 for the wall around the time of SOTU and that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d 17. \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of money right now to build a wall. We\u2019re building the wall.\u201d Again, no. 18. \u201cI hope that she\u2019s healthy, I hope she\u2019s happy, and I hope she lives for a long time.\u201d Trump\u2019s response here to a question on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 presidential. 19. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been very religious.\u201d Huh. 20. \u201cI\u2019ve been told, and I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s true, I would be surprised if it\u2019s true, but a lot of people said that list was one of the reasons I won.\u201d This is true. As I wrote at the time, Trump\u2019s decision to release a list of judges he would consider for any Supreme Court vacancy was hugely important in rallying conservatives to him. 21. \u201cThe world is not doing well and we\u2019re going great.\u201d Trump on the global situation: America :) Rest of world :( 22. \u201cCoach Belichick endorsed me, you remember that?\u201d True! And in letter form no less! 23. \u201cI was very pleased that he called me to thank me for helping him with Canada and yeah, it looks good.\u201d Donald Trump is pro-NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. So, there\u2019s that! 24.  \u201cI feel very badly for Louisiana because that was maybe the worst call I\u2019ve ever seen but I guess there\u2019s nothing they can do about that. And you might say it, I feel badly for Louisiana.\u201d First off, it WAS a terrible call. Second, might I say it? 25. \u201cIt looks like Elizabeth Warren has not caught on like they thought she would. She fell into a trap. It\u2019s called the Pocahontas trap.\u201d \u201cThe Pocahontas Trap?\u201d Is that a Disney flick? 26. \u201cThe truth is there are some I\u2019d love to run against.\u201d Donald Trump on 2020 Democrats: \u201cSome I\u2019d love to run against.\u201d This feels like the right place to stop.",

His debate teams have won five national championships and he has been recognized three times as the national debate coach of the year. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter. The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion at CNN. The sixth Democratic debate started uneventfully with almost no daylight appearing between the candidates for over an hour. But in the debate\u2019s second half, when the debaters finally warmed up and began to find areas to distinguish themselves, it was the women who came out on top in my gradebook. A- Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar had the best answer to the first question in the debate about impeachment. She touched on President Donald Trump \u201ccalling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent\u201d and argued that he should allow his administration to testify and \u201cnot be scared to put forward his own witnesses\u201d \u2013 important points in persuading more people that Trump should be impeached. Other Democrats on stage gave far more standard answers when explaining why they thought Trump was a bad president. I teach my students that there\u2019s a fine line between assertiveness, which is good, and aggression, which is often seen as abrasive. Klobuchar walks that fine line in almost every debate. Thursday night, she got the better of Mayor Pete Buttigieg with her direct, yet not rude, comments about his lack of experience and how the other Democratic contenders have accomplished much more than he has. Klobuchar also walked the line between progressive and pragmatic when she said that \u201cI just don\u2019t think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time.\u201d I\u2019m always asked who can stand up to Trump in a debate, and Klobuchar demonstrated last night that she\u2019d have no problem handling Trump\u2019s insults or abrasiveness. Klobuchar can go on the offensive with the best of the candidates. Who won the Democratic debate? B+ Elizabeth Warren Warren and Buttigieg had a lively debate over campaign financing, with Warren pressing the mayor over his fundraising at a wine cave. I thought this was the best part of the debate, with both candidates making sound, reasonable arguments for their positions: Warren charged that Buttigieg was opening himself up to big money influence by holding exclusive fundraisers, and that we need to keep money out of politics, since the candidates receiving it are often beholden to the source after they are elected. She later was able to pivot that argument into her themes of income inequality, corporate greed, and corruption. I very much liked Warren\u2019s statement that she would, in the Rose Garden, annually read the names of transgender women and people of color who have been killed in the last year. It was touching. Still, she got lost in the debate at times, and didn\u2019t appear to have as much conviction as I\u2019ve seen her display in past debates. B- Andrew Yang Yang stayed out of the main scrums, which helped and hurt the businessman. He was able to press his freedom dividend several times in the debate, which is one of his strengths. But there were moments when I wanted to hear more from Yang, and that means that he\u2019s got to be a bit more assertive at times. This debate featured fewer players, so it would have benefitted Yang to try to wrestle more speaking time. I liked his previous above-the-fray approach to an overly crowded debate stage, but found his trepidation last night overly cautious. Compare this with Klobuchar, who inserted herself into many different topics. As usual, when Yang spoke, I thought he made excellent arguments, and his comment on how special needs children are the new normal likely hit home with a lot of viewers. B- Bernie Sanders Sanders was able to pick at the edges of a couple big skirmishes, while still remaining fairly undamaged. When Warren and Buttigieg were going back and forth about big campaign donors, Bernie had a cute line about Mayor Pete needing to catch Joe Biden in billionaire donors, since he was trailing by a count of 44 to 39. Unfortunately, on many occasions, Sanders\u2019 speaking delivery verged on yelling, a choice that simply doesn\u2019t suit him well. His last two debates were his best, and it\u2019s mostly because he remained calm. I\u2019d like that Bernie back. C Pete Buttigieg Buttigieg had his worst debate yet. When attacked, it\u2019s important to keep your cool. Mayor Pete handled his first foray against Elizabeth Warren well. While the optics of fundraising at a wine cave are about as bad as you can get, Mayor Pete held his ground. Buttigieg\u2019s retort to Warren was sound: to beat Trump, he argued, the Democrats should use all means at their disposal \u2013 including money from wealthy donors. Debate coach: Buttigieg and Yang stole the show However, after that, Amy Klobuchar seemed to get under his skin when she began a series of attacks about the value of experience. His responses were incongruously sharp in tone, yet unfocused in content. Buttigieg\u2019s answer about his relationship to the First Amendment was both unclear in its relevancy and out of sync with the debate. Pro tip: If you ever have to say \u201cAnd before the break\u2026\u201d as Buttigieg did in this instance, just let it go. Nobody can remember what the point was in the first place, but by picking back up a lost cause, it reminds everyone that you are still steaming about something that happened earlier in the debate. Finally, Buttigieg\u2019s response about his capability to win the election fell slightly short. He appeared flustered to me, and this was the first time I\u2019d seen it in a debate. C Tom Steyer Steyer had his best debate, and made some good points. As I have noted in past debates, his incessant staring at the camera is off-putting, especially since he\u2019s the only one doing it. Steyer needs to remember: It\u2019s a debate, not a podcast. However, if you were just listening to the debate and not watching it, Steyer had a lot of reasonable arguments. He\u2019s the Richard Nixon of our time. Steyer\u2019s a better debater on the radio than television. C- Joe Biden Biden\u2019s been unimpressive in these debates. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to understand his point, and sometimes he gives a meandering answer to a question about Guantanamo Bay in which he ends up talking about Israel and a two-state solution. On Thursday, Biden was asked why he couldn\u2019t close the detention camp during the Obama administration, and after saying he needed congressional authority, he said, \u201cLook, what we have done around the world in terms of keeping Guantanamo open or what Trump has done by no longer being an honest broker in Israel, there\u2019s no solution for Israel other than a two-state solution.\u201d The former vice president didn\u2019t ever circle back to explain how his administration tried to close Guantanamo Bay.  Anytime a debater saves their interruption for the end of a debate, I expect the next words out of their mouth to be both clear and one of their stronger points of the night. So, when Biden said he was going to interrupt on the topic of Medicare for all, I was expecting a slam dunk answer. Unfortunately, Biden simply began spouting off numbers about the cost, and while I know what he was trying to say, it appeared that he just trailed off, got interrupted, and didn\u2019t even finish his point. During this exchange, his floundering didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Klobuchar tried to interrupt, and Biden should have been glad to let her do just that.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Steve Bullock is the governor of Montana and a Democratic presidential candidate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN. Five hours after President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president, he did something no other president had done before. He began his campaign for re-election. Previously, presidents focused on doing their jobs before filing for re-election, with President Obama waiting more than two years before officially restarting his campaign apparatus. Yet President Trump is not alone. Members of Congress start raising money for their next election almost immediately after their last election is over. Often, they carry forward money from their last campaign, building up stockpiles of cash to discourage potential challengers. Many even use money raised for their congressional campaign as the foundation for their presidential bid. Of the eight current Democratic federal officeholders running for president, seven transferred money from their federal accounts. This doesn\u2019t just affect campaigns; it affects governing. The rule in Washington is fundraising first, and everything else second. Issue One, a nonprofit dedicated to government ethics and political reform, estimates that members of the last Congress spent nearly 1.5 million hours fundraising for their re-election campaigns. Meanwhile, Congress hasn\u2019t passed a budget on time in more than 20 years. It\u2019s only natural to wonder how they might have spent their time otherwise. Meeting with the voters who got them to Washington in the first place? Attending committee hearings and floor debates? Or, Heaven forbid, building relationships with other members of Congress \u2013 maybe even those from the other party? The truth is we send our representatives to Washington to do a lot of important things, but running for re-election isn\u2019t one of them. More than just the opportunity cost of the time spent, it\u2019s the content of the time that is wasted. When members of Congress spend nearly every day chasing donations, that means they spend almost every day listening to the interests behind that campaign cash. No wonder almost nothing seems to get done anymore. The unending cycle of chasing campaign cash, and the monied interests that dole it out, grinds progress in Washington to a halt. Steve Bullock: What my $100,000 in student debt taught me And the effects of these priorities extend beyond DC. When our leaders obsess over landing the biggest checks, regular folks \u2013 voters \u2013 lose trust that their input, or even their vote, really makes a lick of difference. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. When we send leaders to Washington, let\u2019s require that they spend at least half of their term working for the voters \u2013 not for the money. That means no chasing donors, no PAC checks, no fundraising \u2013 not even setting up a campaign committee \u2013 until they first do the job they were elected to do. Expecting our elected officials to spend at least half of their time actually doing their jobs is just common sense. But in Washington, common sense can be a pretty radical idea. So, to make things simple, here\u2019s how it would work. At the end of a campaign, every federal elected official and challenger would be required to close their campaign account and stop campaign activity. They couldn\u2019t restart their campaign until half-way through the term of the office they hold: that\u2019s three years for US senators, two years for presidents and one year for members of the House. During that time, they couldn\u2019t file for re-election, solicit donations, clog up your inbox with fundraising emails or raise money for affiliated leadership PACs. Any money a campaign has remaining after paying expenses from the last election will be donated to charity, the presidential matching funds program, or to the government for deficit reduction. When everyone starts from zero, an incumbent\u2019s campaign account can\u2019t be used to scare away challengers for the next election or used to lay the groundwork for running for a different office. It\u2019s what we do in Montana after each election \u2013 and it works.  In 2016, Donald Trump won Montana by 20 points. That same year I ran as a pro-choice, pro-union, populist Democrat and was re-elected by four points. Despite those partisan divides, we\u2019ve been able to get progressive things done by showing up and working together \u2013 from expanding Medicaid to nearly 100,000 people to freezing college tuition and banning dark money. If we can do that in Montana, we can do it all across our country. Unfortunately, this past week in Washington has demonstrated how desperately reform is needed to restore credibility in government and take on big challenges. While the impeachment inquiry is necessary to investigate threats to our national security, we cannot allow it to exacerbate divides and further stall progress. Our leaders in Washington have to earn back the trust of the American people \u2013 and doing their job should be the first step.",

She is also completing a doctorate in Renaissance literature. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. So who is the man who forced British Ambassador Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation, even if he\u2019s not yet Britain\u2019s Prime Minister? Blond, bouffant, boorish: meet Boris Johnson. Or perhaps President Donald Trump \u2013 with the thatched locks, rotund frame and fragmented speaking style, it gets harder and harder to tell them apart. One has achieved a lifetime goal of his nation\u2019s highest office, while the other seems on the brink. Darroch clearly felt he had no choice but to resign after Johnson wouldn\u2019t commit to retaining him in the post after the unauthorized disclosure of the ambassador\u2019s secret cables calling the Trump administration \u201cinept.\u201d Outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May had offered Darroch her full support, but Johnson, who is pally with Trump, already calls the shots in Westminster. After years as a journalist, media star and politician, Johnson is now the leading candidate in a run-off race to become leader of the British Conservative Party, following Theresa May\u2019s resignation. And because the Conservative Party holds a (painfully slim) plurality in the British House of Commons, the leader elected by the roughly 160,000 grassroots members traditionally becomes the new Prime Minister. (The party\u2019s sitting Members of Parliament themselves have selected two candidates to face their members \u2013 Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.) To many of the rest of the nearly 67 million British people, that feels unfair. But it\u2019s the same system that brought to power May herself (though her final opponent conceded before the members\u2019 vote) and Labour\u2019s Gordon Brown after the 2007 fall of Tony Blair. The upshot of this system is that British political parties often elect leaders who rally their base more than they appeal to the country at large. That\u2019s one reason why Johnson, a man who has defended British colonialism and described non-white subjects of the Commonwealth as \u201cpickaninnies,\u201d (a comment for which he later apologized, then backtracked and defended), looks set to win big. Kim Darroch, UK ambassador to US, resigns after Trump cables leak What worries British moderates \u2013 including many in the Conservative Party \u2013 is that Johnson reminds them all too much of another bombastic leader who whipped up the worst sentiments of a largely white male base in a primary election, but went on to find that much of the rest of the nation was happy to join in at the general election. We could be about to see the release of \u201cTrump II: This Time He\u2019s British.\u201d As with Trump\u2019s GOP primary run, many moderate Conservatives have said they\u2019ll leave their party if Johnson wins; we wait to see whether they\u2019ll show more commitment to this promise than many of the so-called Never Trumpers. (Plenty of MPs said they\u2019d never let Johnson onto the final shortlist of candidates. They were nonetheless cowed by threats of the base\u2019s anger were he excluded, promises of jobs and a meticulous whipping operation.) Others say they\u2019re not sure which they fear more: Johnson winning the leadership election and then losing the next general election to the far-leftist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, or Johnson winning the leadership election \u2013 and actually obtaining a fresh mandate to run the country. Many British commentators have already drawn the Johnson-Trump comparison. (Especially when Steve Bannon, the former Trump guru, popped up to claim he\u2019s been giving advice to Johnson.) The Financial Times\u2019 Philip Stephens points out that both revel in telling bare-faced lies. (By the time the newspapers have fact-checked, the news cycle has moved on \u2013 so who cares?) And, at the Guardian, Gaby Hinsliff argues that this is the consequence of a society that has forgotten the concept of shame. When it comes to shamelessness, little beats  Johnson\u2019s U-turns (or EU-turns) on the subject of Brexit. Boris Johnson is in denial about the reality of Brexit Once the Daily Telegraph\u2019s EU correspondent, where he fed that readership\u2019s existing Euroscepticism with nonsense scare-stories about EU overreach, he then became a pro-EU Mayor of London, only to pivot back to Euroscepticism just as the Brexit campaign began to gather steam. Notoriously, he is reported to have written two articles the night he decided to back the Brexit campaign, one arguing for, one against, so he had both ready to go when he finally made his decision the next day. At the New York Times, the sociologist Will Davies has pointed out that this has allowed Johnson to ride the wave of an electorate convinced that the complexity of renegotiating Britain\u2019s biggest trading agreement is, in fact, an elitist conspiracy \u2013 that it has only taken so long to negotiate an exit deal because \u201cBritain\u2019s Treasury Department, the Bank of England and Downing Street itself are now conspiring to deny Britain its sovereignty.\u201d Johnson\u2019s voters are people who don\u2019t like to be told that leaving the EU involves compromises, that government has to make difficult decisions. Trump, too, trades on a narrative of economic victimhood \u2013 and a pretense that decisions about fiscal responsibility can be brushed aside by the roar of a rally. But even darker shadows than mendacity, shamelessness and fiscal populism now hang over Johnson\u2019s campaign. After years of a public image as an entertaining clown \u2013 Johnson, like Trump, had his big break on TV \u2013 stories of the Conservative leader as a bully, cheat and a selfish womanizer have begun to emerge. Remind you of anyone? His former boss, Max Hastings, writes in the Guardian: \u201cAlmost the only people who think Johnson a nice guy are those who do not know him.\u201d Two weeks ago, the police were called to the flat Johnson shares with his latest girlfriend, after the Guardian reported that neighbors had recorded a woman screaming \u201cget off me\u201d. (Police acknowledged responding to an incident but said no one was harmed.) Does any of this matter? Not for Trump, and probably not for Johnson. Whether it\u2019s the report of an affair with an employee, (Johnson called the report \u201can inverted pyramid of piffle\u201d but then his Conservative boss sacked him as a cultural affairs spokesman for lying about it), or the time he was taped agreeing to help a fraudster friend beat up a journalist (he claims he never followed through), or Hastings\u2019 claim that as a magazine editor, Johnson essentially tried to blackmail him, \u2018threatening dire consequences in print if I continued to criticise him\u2019 (he has not yet commented) \u2013 by now, most of the Eurosceptic conservatives likely to vote for Johnson know he\u2019s a bit of a bastard. The problem is, as the old saying goes, he\u2019s their bastard. In the land of Johnson-Trump, gratuitously insulting foreign partners is a mark of virility. The 'special relationship' between the UK and US is crumbling Rumours that you\u2019ve fathered children by multiple women are a sign you\u2019re an alpha male. (Last month, Johnson backer Johnny Mercer MP told the BBC that the exact number of children Johnson has fathered is \u201centirely a matter for him\u201d and an \u201centirely inappropriate\u201d subject for public discussion.) And a willingness to play dark and dirty is evidence you\u2019ll pull out all stops to promote your nations\u2019 interests \u2013 who cares about little matters like human rights or the rule of law? Like Trump, Johnson has been open about his ambition for the premiership for many years. Like Trump, he\u2019s been accused of chronic laziness when it comes to actually handling the details of government \u2013 most disastrously, for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman whose sentence in an Iranian prison for alleged spying was extended after Johnson, as foreign secretary, seemed to confirm Iran\u2019s accusations against her instead of denying them. (Johnson\u2019s critics allege that he failed to read his briefing notes.) But what drives Johnson if it\u2019s neither an intellectual interest in the details of policy, or an instinctive sense of national service? Perhaps the same thing as Trump: a chronic insecurity. When Johnson\u2019s reputed former mistress described his political motivation in 2016, she could have been describing Donald Trump\u2019s thirst for ever-more celebratory rallies: \u201cThere is an element of Boris that wants to be Prime Minister because the love of his family and Tory voters is not enough. He wants to be loved by the entire world. He would send himself into space if only to find new planets whose inhabitants would love him, too.\u201d  Unlike Trump, however, Johnson may find the long-desired job \u2013 and the love of Tory voters \u2013 isn\u2019t his for long unless he sharpens up his act. The latest EU deadline for a Brexit deal runs out on October 31, 2019. Anti-Johnson Conservatives have threatened by that date to bring down any government he runs if he hasn\u2019t secured a deal. It\u2019s easier to grift through an election campaign than it is to grift through government.",

The genius of America is that we allowed capitalism to work its magic while also moderating it with appropriate regulation, tax policy, workers\u2019 rights and the building of great societal infrastructure, including a safety net. The right answer to wealth and opportunity inequality is not to reject market-based capitalism, but to make it more just and inclusive. John Delaney searches for a middle lane in a crowded 2020 Democratic field The wrong answer is socialism; in its pure form, it is a bad economic model and it\u2019s the wrong political approach. This is something we need to talk openly about because despite the real-world calamity that a Trump White House represents for our republic, we seem determined to fight out this primary in the abstract, debating the need to pursue a fundamentally different economic model for our country. We need to talk about socialism in 2019, because President Trump is certainly going to talk about it in 2020. It\u2019s a fight he wants to have and if we\u2019re not careful, it\u2019s a fight that we\u2019ll lose \u2013 and lose the election with it.  Even if \u201cDemocratic Socialism\u201d doesn\u2019t aim to eliminate all private enterprise, on important issues like health care, plans like Medicare for All would make most forms of private insurance illegal and implement government-run systems, limiting choice and competition. According to a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released this week just 18% of Americans view the term socialism positively, while 50% see it in a negative light. For that reason, President Trump would love for the 2020 election to be about socialism, as its one of the few things in the country that has a lower approval rating than he does. Ilhan Omar's wrongheaded attack on former President Barack Obama Fresh off Congress roundly rejecting his demands to build a wall, the President used the State of the Union platform to argue that \u201cAmerica will never be a socialist country.\u201d Sometimes when I say \u201ccapitalist\u201d at Democratic events, it feels like I\u2019m airing a family secret. But I believe that it\u2019s important to tell the truth. The truth about where I stand and the truth about what\u2019s best for the country. For decades the mainstream of the Democratic Party believed in free markets, a healthy private sector and free trade. We understood that you couldn\u2019t be pro-worker without also having places for workers to work, which required innovative and competitive businesses. But we also understood the need to build a strong safety net and a culture of opportunity. For decades, the Democratic Party made the tough argument that we needed a market-based economy and strong social programs, working in tandem with regulations and worker protections. We called for a social compact to make sure that prosperity was shared and that opportunity expanded with each generation. Democrats successfully argued that capitalism was stronger when we had top-notch infrastructure, meaningful investments in science and research, great public schools and workers who had the ability to buy the products being sold and the flexibility to start their own businesses. Trump must be dancing for joy at Sherrod Brown news This wasn\u2019t always easy, either. Democratic presidents fought like hell to raise wages, to make sure more people could go to college, retire with dignity, have health care and access to a safety net in tough times. But remember, President Obama, needed every last vote to pass the Affordable Care Act, a landmark achievement now seemingly dismissed as a half-loaf compromise \u2013 or worse \u2013 by the far left of our party. However, the social compact around capitalism has frayed, especially when it comes to health care, education, global warming and opportunity. Relative to inflation, wages have been mostly flat, while the long-term costs of health care, education and retirement have increased. Stark inequalities have been obscured by rosy macroeconomic data. Over the past decade, 80% of venture capital has gone to just  four states. In most counties in the United States, there\u2019s no evidence of any economic mobility and many are being left behind. That\u2019s because we haven\u2019t made the proper investments or updated our policies. The K-12 model was once an incredible achievement \u2013 but it\u2019s not good enough anymore. We need to establish nationwide universal pre-K and offer two years of free community college or technical training, replacing K-12 with pre-K-14.  We need to reimagine what education looks like in the 21st century. The interstate highway system was once world class \u2013 but it\u2019s not good enough anymore, it\u2019s falling apart. The benefits model that encouraged employer-based health care isn\u2019t good enough anymore when people change jobs and employers frequently. We need to make benefits portable so that people have the freedom to change careers and start their own businesses.   In many cases we pushed deregulation too far and we cut taxes too deep. There\u2019s not enough money to invest in the programs that benefit society as a whole anymore. We created a Wild West in many industries and it ultimately meant that people were hurt. For Democrats, age is just a number The socialists in our country are right to be upset with how the last few decades have gone \u2013 they just don\u2019t have the right solutions. Even Democratic voters recognize this. In a poll last month 86% of Democratic Iowa caucus goers said they would prefer a candidate who will work across the aisle, as compared to only 4% who want a candidate who is less likely to work with Republicans. For a long time, the Republican message has been \u201cgovernment is the problem.\u201d I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s credible. But I also think that it\u2019s not credible to offer an alternative that says \u201cgovernment is the answer to everything.\u201d We need a strong mixed economy: a healthy private sector with smart public investment and regulations. We need a tax code that is fair, including raising rates on capital gains income and high-earners. Tax rates of 70% aren\u2019t the answer, but neither are the irresponsible rates in Trump\u2019s tax law.  And we need to tackle threats to the next generation, like climate change and the ballooning deficit.  Democrats need to restore capitalism\u2019s promise. We\u2019re not going to take back the White House by appealing to 18% of the population. Gifting President Trump a second term in the pursuit of ideological purity not rooted in sound economics or moving the argument further would be a tragedy for working people, for vulnerable communities and for the country as a whole.",

Much has changed in American politics since that fateful day in January 2017, especially for the modern Republican Party. Yet to start 2019, President Trump and the Republican Party appear to be entering the political equivalent of the terrible twos. In what may be considered a political tantrum on the part of the President and the Republican leadership in Congress, the federal government remains partially closed \u2014 the longest shutdown in American history. Frustration is increasing as the Trump presidency evolves. And critics within the Republican Party continue to rankle the President. Earlier this month, Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT), the Republican presidential candidate in 2012, sounded off in the most public of forums: an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he declared that the \u201cpresident has not risen to the mantle of office.\u201d In reply, Trump tweeted: \u201cI won big and he didn\u2019t,\u201d while Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) recently dismissed Romney\u2019s critique as a case of \u201csour grapes.\u201d The presidency of Donald Trump has been unprecedented in many ways. Yet in this respect, in the public disputes with members of his own party, he is not alone in American history. In the years before the Civil War, the Democratic Party, then in power, unraveled from within in ways that are eerily familiar to close observers of the current political moment. At issue was the key question of executive authority versus the power of the Congress and the will of the people. In 1857, the new territory of Kansas clamored for admission to the Union. But there was a catch. A pro-slavery constitutional convention meeting at Lecompton had approved a governing document that permitted the peculiar institution. Although the Lecompton constitution seemed to represent the will of the people, in fact, it had been fraudulently obtained. In calling the convention, the pro-slavery territorial legislature had refused to offer a provision to exclude slavery from the territory; in turn, the anti-slavery opposition boycotted the convention. Since the majority of citizens in Kansas actually opposed slavery, the popular will of the people had been ignored. What was to be done? Congress and the President would now decide the issue. The last bachelor to ever be President The President at the time, James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, engaged in a bitter personal dispute with Sen. Stephen Douglas of Illinois, then a leading contender for the presidency in 1860. In his 1857 annual message to Congress (delivered in writing before the era of live State of the Union addresses), President Buchanan insisted that the Lecompton Constitution represented the rightful will of the sovereign citizens of Kansas. The next day, Stephen Douglas announced his disagreement with the president on the floor of the Senate. The split had officially begun. In the ensuing months, the struggle turned bitterly personal. Buchanan threatened to read Douglas out of the party, turning to the example of President Andrew Jackson decades earlier during the Nullification Crisis, in which South Carolina threatened to secede from the Union. Douglas acidly retorted: \u201cMr. President, I wish you to remember that General Jackson is dead, sir.\u201d The revealing words Trump said about Pelosi's trip The two men broke off social relations, with Buchanan going so far as to prevent Douglas from visiting the White House under any circumstance. The feud between Buchanan and Douglas mirrored the dissolution of the Democratic Party and, by extension, the two-party system that had held together the country before the Civil War. In 1860, Douglas obtained the nomination as the Democratic candidate, but at a great cost. Southern Democrats refused to endorse him, turning instead to Buchanan\u2019s vice president, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, whom Buchanan publicly supported. Harry Reid: Trump is 'amoral' and 'the worst president we've ever had' The nation had taken one more step on the road to civil war. With the Democrats divided, the Republicans fielded the relatively unknown Abraham Lincoln of Illinois. In the election, Lincoln won the electoral vote by winning only votes in the northern states (he wasn\u2019t even on the ballot in the South). In response, South Carolina voted to secede from the Union. Six other Deep South states soon followed. During the winter months of 1860 to 1861, President Buchanan refused to prevent the Southern states from seceding, declaring that the Constitution did not permit him to do so. Americans were outraged. When Buchanan left office in March 1861, he was widely derided by members of his own party as a traitor. History has been even less kind. Today historians judge him among the very worst of US presidents, a position that some now say that President Trump is doomed to occupy. Although the events of the 1850s happened long ago, they offer a crucial insight for the remaining years of the Trump presidency. To avoid the pitfalls of ineffective leadership and  the disgrace of falling to last place in presidential rankings, the president should listen to critics within his own party. Had President Buchanan not stubbornly held his grudge against Stephen Douglas, the Democratic Party might have remain unified. If President Trump and his allies read Mitt Romney and other critics out of the Republican Party, they do so at their own peril.  The present government shutdown threatens to doom the Trump presidency to historical ignominy, but it need not do so. Had President Buchanan taken more forceful action to stop southern secession, history would remember him more kindly. If President Trump refuses to reopen the government, history may well judge him among the worst ever to serve. The choice is his. The unpopularity of the Trump presidency at midterm serves as a potent reminder of the failures of past presidents. To avoid the worst effects of the terrible twos, the president would be well advised to heed the lessons of the past.",

            "article_content": "Anita Dunn remembers a time in politics when it was almost unheard-of for women to be running political campaigns. Susan Estrich was Michael Dukakis\u2019 campaign manager in 1988, but she was an anomaly until 2000, when Dunn and another woman, Gina Glantz, ran the Bill Bradley campaign. Now, not so much. Dunn, a senior adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden, appeared at Thursday\u2019s CITIZEN by CNN event in New York with four other women in senior positions for leading Democratic presidential campaigns: Nina Turner, national co-chair for Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign; Lis Smith, senior adviser to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign; Lily Adams, communications director for Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign; and Kristen Orthman, communications director for Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign. It is a show of force illustrating that the days of men running campaigns to elect other men are heading to the dustbin of history. \u201cI mean, all of you bring credibility to the campaigns you work for. All of you are seen as these senior strategists and enormously talented people. You\u2019re not the token woman any longer. And I will tell you that there was a time when \u2013 and I think Senator Turner [too], we were the \u2018women\u2019 who were at the table. And it wasn\u2019t that long ago, actually,\u201d Dunn explained. These women aren\u2019t the only ones serving in top positions in Democratic presidential campaigns. Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon is campaign manager for Beto O\u2019Rourke and Maya Rupert holds the same title for Juli\u00e1n Castro. In 2016, on the Republican side, Kellyanne Conway, now senior counselor to President Donald Trump, made history as the first woman to lead a successful presidential campaign. Smith has the unique position of trying to elect the first president who identifies as gay, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. She sees this campaign as different from any of the other 20 she\u2019s worked on. \u201cI got in on the ground floor. There wasn\u2019t this coterie of high-powered men around him, so I had the ability to really shape the campaign, and shape the direction we were going in, and shape the hiring. To me, it\u2019s very important to empower women on campaigns,\u201d she says. Pete Buttigieg gets aggressive as he looks to break out of the middle Smith is particularly proud that 53% of the campaign is female, which she says helps ensure women are in leadership roles. She argues that she is able to influence her boss is because he is 37 years old and didn\u2019t grow up in what she called the \u201c\u2018Mad Men\u2019 generation.\u201d \u201cHe grew up at the same time as I did, where workplaces were changing, and where you did see women in leadership roles,\u201d Smith said. Former Ohio state Sen. Turner started her long political career in the Buckeye State. She was elected to the Cleveland City Council in 2006 and then appointed to the Ohio state Senate in 2008, but it always struck her how differently she was treated from her male colleagues. \u201cI remember very clearly that my colleagues were always referred to as Senator. Senator this, and Senator that. We could be in the same room \u2026 and I would be Nina. And for me, it is important that my first name is Senator, my last name is Turner, because you earned that title,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes women are not given the kind of respect that they have earned, and that they deserve,\u201d she adds. Sanders unveils plan to legalize marijuana, invest tax revenue in minority businesses Turner is now a national co-chair for Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, and while it means a great deal to her to be in her position, she believes the work is not over for her and other women. Her message is that women should bring who they are to the table and not be afraid to do that \u2013 a task she admits has been challenging, even for her. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard, especially if you\u2019re an African American woman. You assert yourself, people want to call you angry, that stereotype. I want the world to know I am angry, I am mad as hell about what\u2019s going on in the world. And angry black women are taking applications, so y\u2019all can join us and be an angry black woman, too. But angry for good,\u201d Turner explains. Orthman hasn\u2019t always worked for women. She is now the communications director for Warren\u2019s presidential campaign, but she spent eight years with Majority Leader Harry Reid in his Senate office. The Nevada Democrat has told CNN that one of his proudest accomplishments in the Senate was being an early leader on making it easy for working moms to thrive in his office, which Orthman said had stuck with her. \u201cI thought it was the norm that a meeting would be scheduled for our foreign policy adviser at 4 so she could go pick up her kid at 5. Realizing that wasn\u2019t the norm was pretty eye-opening, particularly on Capitol Hill, which I think is not that welcoming for working moms,\u201d she explains. Elizabeth Warren is alarmed about turmoil in overnight lending markets For Orthman, working for someone who is trying to be the first female president is an honor, and with it comes new conversations that would happen only with a female boss. \u201cWe had a week-long discussion about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s pregnancy; if I was working for Harry Reid that wouldn\u2019t have happened. But they\u2019re different people, and I think all of us that have worked for different bosses would say, male or female, you do the best to communicate who this person is, and who and what they\u2019re fighting for,\u201d Orthman says. Adams has a truly unique perspective on politics, and the pressures that come with running for office as a woman. It\u2019s likely because she saw her first campaign up close and personal at 3 years old. Her grandmother, Ann Richards, ran for Texas governor in 1990 and won, becoming the first woman to capture the position in half a century. She famously held up a T-shirt at the state Capitol during celebrations that read: \u201cA woman\u2019s place is in the dome.\u201d Adams\u2019 mother, Cecile Richards, carried on the political torch as the former president of Planned Parenthood. She says she\u2019s grateful to both of them for teaching her to be outspoken, funny, and hard-hitting. \u201cIf I had not raised my hand, Ann Richards would have kicked my ass. So I think that I just had a benefit of being surrounded by examples of women who were not afraid to speak up and who were not afraid to shake the status quo and encourage that behavior among any of the kids that were in the family,\u201d she says. Twitter tells Kamala Harris why it won't suspend Trump's account Adams thinks that for women and girls of her generation, that isn\u2019t always the case. \u201cThere\u2019s, I think, especially even women and girls of our generation were raised, many of them, not to be funny, not to speak up, not to raise your hand,\u201d she observes. She has worked for her fair share of powerful women. In addition to her role now on the Harris campaign, she was Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 Iowa communications director. She saw firsthand how her boss was treated differently. \u201cThere was extraordinary discussion over what she was wearing, why was she wearing that? Did that convey the right message? Was she being too angry? Was her tone exactly right?\u201d she explains. Across the board, Adams still thinks women have a tougher time running for office, but she does believe it\u2019s getting better. She hopes more women on campaigns and in office will make the environment better for future generations. \u201cI also think more women in power, more women in Congress, more women, hopefully, in the White House will make that better. But because they\u2019re trying to make people see something that hasn\u2019t been before, there\u2019s no mold for it,\u201d she says. Campaigns are, by definition, raw and freewheeling. But 2020 is the first presidential election cycle since the MeToo era began, and things are changing. \u201cCampaigns, which used to be like the craziest startup ever, right? \u2026 They\u2019re like running a, having a huge amount of money come in with no infrastructure, no HR, no nothing, right, and just a bunch of people running around trying to win,\u201d Dunn explained. \u201cI think that there is a much higher degree of sensitivity, and awareness,\u201d she added. Smith recalls working on campaigns in 2004 and 2006 and it was not unusual to see senior male staffers going out with interns. \u201cI think today you wouldn\u2019t see that, and you can\u2019t do that anymore and there\u2019s no tolerance for that on the campaign,\u201d Smith says. Presidential campaigns, and these women running them, have had to reconcile how exactly to change a long-standing culture in politics, and the general consensus among the five women on the stage is things are getting better. Joe Biden releases labor plan in middle-class pitch \u201cWe have trainings. We have rules about this. \u2026 Back then it was just, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re all having fun,\u2019 but now it\u2019s understood that that\u2019s not OK and that that\u2019s not how we do our campaigns. \u2026 That culture, really, I got to say, no spin, has come to an end, at least in this campaign and the last couple of campaigns I\u2019ve worked on,\u201d Smith says. Consequences, Turner says, are key to making sure disrupting behaviors do not affect the campaign. \u201cYou just can\u2019t assume that everybody comes to the space and the place with the same experiences and/or value. So you have to set the tone. And that\u2019s certainly what we have done in the Sanders campaign. And you have to make sure that there are consequences for behaviors that are not becoming of what the campaign reflects. And that\u2019s whether you are a man or a woman,\u201d Turner says. When women become the majority in the workplace, Dunn points out, things will shift monumentally. \u201cThis is a sea change that you\u2019re seeing. The expectation that those policies are going to be in place and that senior management is going to actually take them seriously. So it\u2019s not just a book on the shelf,\u201d Dunn points out. The old boys\u2019 club of politics is changing, and while a so-called \u201cnew girls\u2019 club\u201d may be growing, Turner warned that it is critical to include men in discussions about empowering women even more. \u201cThat\u2019s what got us into the mess that we\u2019re in right now,\u201d Turner says. \u201cThe country is messed up right now because the boys had been having all the fun, and now women are here to make some crooked paths straight, but not at the expense of men. We need some co-conspirators,\u201d she adds. Adams gave a real-world example of how important is it to have people with different life experiences on these campaigns. \u201cA woman who is a part of our debate prep team had her child, gave birth, on debate two that night. And she was on calls with me all the way up until she went into that delivery room. \u2026 And so she has a different experience, a personal experience, when we\u2019re rolling out our paid leave policy, when we\u2019re talking about, as a campaign, what kind of paid leave should we provide to people on the campaign,\u201d Adams says. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just women only, it\u2019s women of color, it\u2019s young women, it\u2019s older women, it\u2019s men, it\u2019s LGBT community. So I think we just need to look at these campaigns holistically to think, are they reflecting the people that we want to actually cast the ballot for us?\u201d she said. Dunn looked around at the women sitting beside her and marveled. \u201cThere\u2019s not a one of you who couldn\u2019t get hired on your merits and not because \u2018We need to have a woman.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Because we need Lis Smith\u2019 or it\u2019s, \u2018We need Lily Adams\u2019 because she\u2019s going to give us a kind of instant credibility, talent and strategic advice that\u2019s going to make our race look like it\u2019s a real race. And that\u2019s a sea change even from eight years ago,\u201d Dunn said, beaming.",

And so this is a home for everybody who shares those values.\u201d The group\u2019s founders said they traveled around the country recently to listen to women\u2019s stories and learn what issues are most pressing for them. \u201cI think women are just finally saying, you know, if we\u2019re the majority of the voters, we\u2019re the majority of volunteers, of the activists, and work on every single issue, why aren\u2019t the things that we care about actually front and center in the political agenda,\u201d Richards said on \u201cNew Day.\u201d 2020 Democrats face the most diverse electorate in history Poo said the group is already finding that women want to support their movement. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting when women begin to come together and realize how much we have in common,\u201d she said, noting that because women represented \u201c54% of the voters in the last election,\u201d they \u201chave the opportunity really to determine what happens.\u201d The launch of the group comes nearly six months after a record number of women were elected to Congress, an electoral victory Garza said the group hopes to build on. \u201cWe really want to make sure that in 2019 we solve the problem of women not having legislative power, not having political power, but yet being the majority of voters \u2013 changing the balance of power in Congress, electing historic numbers of women of color to US Congress,\u201d Garza said. \u201cWomen are mad as hell. We\u2019re ready to take action and we know that we\u2019re not going backwards,\u201d she added. As for the current field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, Poo called the six women female candidates \u201ctalented\u201d and added that \u201cmillions of women around the country are watching to see all of the candidates speak to the issues that they care about and actually understand that their concerns should be front and center.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat considering a presidential run in 2020, is planning a trip to Iowa next weekend, a Iowa Democrat with knowledge of the plans tells CNN. The trip comes as Gillibrand inches closer to a bid and begins to build a campaign operation that is expected to be based in Troy, New York, an upstate town close to where Gillibrand lives, according to multiple Democrats who have talked to Gillibrand\u2019s team about the campaign. A second Iowa Democrat tells CNN that Gillibrand and her team have begun courting possible staffers in the state and are reaching out a to a \u201cton\u201d of possible supporters. Gillibrand has also made several key hires, signaling that she is close to making her bid official and an announcement could be imminent. Gillibrand has locked in Dan McNally, formerly the political director at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, as her 2020 campaign director, according to a source with knowledge of the hire. McNally, a longtime Democratic operative who managed Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet\u2019s 2016 campaign, has worked at both the DSCC and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Sources tell CNN that Gillibrand has hired Meredith Kelly, the former communications director for the DCCC, to be the communications director on her expected 2020 run. The New York Times first reported Kelly\u2019s hire. Gillibrand has also tapped Emmy Bengtson, digital director to Gavin Newsom for Governor in 2018 and deputy social media director for Hillary Clinton in 2016, as her deputy communications director, according to a source with knowledge of the hire. Prior to Newsom and Clinton, Bengtson worked on digital strategy for Planned Parenthood and Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign. She was widely considered one of the top digital staffers available in 2020. Bengtson declined to comment. Gillibrand told CNN in December that she was \u201cdefinitely thinking\u201d about running for president and would \u201cmake a decision soon.\u201d Politico first reported Gillibrand was planning the trip to Iowa. Gillibrand\u2019s expected trip to Iowa will come two weeks after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who is exploring a run for president, headlined a series of events during a multi-day swing through the state. A Gillibrand spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Gillibrand, should she officially enter the 2020 field soon, would launch with $10.5 million in the bank, a sizable war chest that would make her one of the most financially formidable candidates. As a senator representing the nation\u2019s financial capital, she also has ties to deep-pocketed donors. The securities and investment sector ranks among the top five industries supporting Gillibrand in recent years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But Gillibrand ran afoul of some powerful Democratic donors after leading calls urging Minnesota Democrat Al Franken to resign from the Senate. Franken quit following allegations that he touched women inappropriately. Gillibrand ran for re-election in 2018, raising nearly $18 million in a race where she coasted to victory over a little-known rival. While the Senate run helped replenish her campaign coffers, it also provided opponents with a potent attack and a question Gillibrand has to answer: She promised voters in 2018 to serve her full term. \u201cI will serve my six-year term,\u201d she said during a Senate debate when asked about her 2020 plans. CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. Donald Trump is probably dancing his svelte, 243-pound self around the White House about now. News that Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is not running for president is no doubt turning Trump\u2019s \u201cExecutive Time\u201d into party time. (I\u2019ll pause for a moment while you deal with the thought of our President doing the Dougie. Better? OK.) Mr. Trump surely could use some good news. His former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, has implicated Trump in alleged felonious conduct. His summit with his dear friend, the Dear Leader Kim Jong Un, exploded like a Musudan missile. The trade deficit Trump promised to reduce is instead at a record high.  And he faces investigations by, among others, Congress, special counsel Robert Mueller, the Southern District of New York, the attorney general of New York, the Washington, DC attorney general, and Hawaii Five-0. (I made up one of those.) Politically, these are not the best of times for Mr. Trump, either. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows an uptick in his approval, actually. But he\u2019s still at an anemic 46%. More troubling for him, only four in 10 Americans plan to vote for him for re-election, while 48% say they plan on voting for a Democrat for president. Sherrod Brown: 'Of course' raise taxes on rich Here\u2019s why Mr. Trump is doing the Humpty Dance on the Truman Balcony: Sherrod Brown could have beaten him, and I bet Trump knows it. Why? The math is simple. Trump got 46% in 2016. He has not been over 50% in the national polls for a single day as president. Brown, a Midwestern economic populist, would have eaten into Trump\u2019s working-class support \u2013 a loss Trump could not offset by gaining ground among, say, people of color, or younger voters. To be clear: I have no preference in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. For the first time in my life I am actually an undecided Democrat. But I have my eyes on the prize, and the prize is sending Mr. Trump back to Fifth Avenue \u2013 or perhaps an extended stay at Club Fed. I\u2019m a JFK Democrat:  I will pay any price, bear any burden, support any friend, oppose any foe to ensure the defeat of Donald J. Trump. The rumpled, gravelly voiced Brown seemed almost custom-made to puncture Trump\u2019s phony \u201cblue collar billionaire\u201d myth. Look at how the national media described him in headlines today (emphasis mine): \u2013 LA Times: \u201cMidwestern populist Sherrod Brown decides against running for president\u201d \u2013 CNBC: \u201cWall Street critic Sen. Sherrod Brown will not challenge Trump in 2020.\u201d \u2013 New York magazine: \u201cHeartland Progressive Sherrod Brown won\u2019t run for president in 2020.\u201d With Trump in a cul-de-sac, unable to expand his appeal beyond working-class whites, a Democrat who could pry away some of those Trump voters looked like a winner to me. After all, Brown won a resounding re-election in November, winning his native Ohio by 6%. Hillary Clinton lost Ohio by 8% in 2016. You don\u2019t need to be a math major to know that a 15-point improvement over Hillary\u2019s razor-thin losses in the Big Ten states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan means the moving vans would be rolling up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. While Brown won\u2019t be running, I hope Democrats pick up his message. \u201cThe Dignity of Work\u201d is not just a slogan for Brown; it is the work of his life. Trump\u2019s re-election depends on Democrats practicing the politics of self-destruction \u2013 and you can be sure that Donald Trump, Fox News and Russian intelligence will be doing all they can to divide Democrats. The key, it seems to me, is to find issues that unite the Democrats\u2019 progressive base and welcome disaffected suburban Republicans, while appealing to working class voters who may feel betrayed by Trump. The path to that coalition lies in economic populism. Sherrod Brown: Howard Schultz is an 'idiot' To be clear, nothing in Brown\u2019s record is less than progressive on social issues. He voted against the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act back in 1996 and has a perfect record from the Human Rights Campaign. He is a strong supporter of gun safety legislation, wearing his \u201cF\u201d rating from the NRA as a badge of honor. His support for a women\u2019s right to choose is so deep he has a 100% lifetime rating from Planned Parenthood Action Fund. His support for civil rights and affirmative action earned him a 100% from the NAACP. A Sherrod Brown candidacy would have tested the proposition that a strong social progressive could earn the support of disillusioned working-class Trump voters by answering Trump\u2019s wedge issues with what President Bill Clinton used to call \u201cweb issues\u201d \u2013 economic issues that unite working people of all identities. Brown\u2019s decision opens up more room on the populist front. If former Vice President Joe Biden runs, he could fill that lane with his \u201cJoe Lunchbucket\u201d appeal.  Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has always had a particularly sharp focus on economic issues, as has Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Others may try to emulate Sherrod Brown\u2019s working-class heroism; I hope so.",

            "article_content": "Michael Bloomberg officially announced his late-entry Democratic presidential bid on Sunday, unveiling a campaign that the former New York mayor said will be squarely aimed at defeating President Donald Trump. Bloomberg, in a letter explaining his candidacy on his campaign website, lays out a more moderate vision for the country and casts himself as \u201ca doer and a problem solver \u2013 not a talker.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump\u2019s reckless and unethical actions,\u201d Bloomberg wrote. Bloomberg\u2019s late 2020 bid \u2013 along with the money the billionaire can spend to fund his campaign \u2013 injects a new level of uncertainty into the race less than three months before the first voting in the race begins. In the last several days there was little doubt he was running. Bloomberg, who had said earlier this year that he would not run, reversed his decision because he doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a candidate in the current field of Democrats who can beat Trump next November, several people close to the former mayor told CNN. That includes former Vice President Joe Biden, who Bloomberg has watched fade in Iowa polling and struggle with fundraising. Just hours after officially entering the 2020 Democratic race, Bloomberg was making calls throughout the day from New York, according to a person close to him. Bloomberg is not the first late entry candidate to get into the race. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also announced earlier this month that he, too, would run for the Democratic nomination. To kick start his campaign, Bloomberg has placed at least $37 million worth of television advertising over the next two weeks, according to data from Kantar Media/CMAG. Bloomberg places at least $37 million in television advertising over next two weeks The ads highlight the mayor\u2019s biography \u2013 \u201cHe could have just been the middle class kid \u2026 but Mike Bloomberg became the guy who did good,\u201d said the ad \u2013 and his post-mayoral work on combating climate change. Then the spot turns to Trump, saying now the mayor is \u201ctaking on him\u201d as an image of Trump freezes on screen. The spot ends with narrator saying \u201c\u2018Mike Bloomberg for President\u201d with Bloomberg saying \u201cI\u2019m Mike Bloomberg and I approve this message.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s massive buy \u2013 60 second spots across some 100 markets \u2013 will begin next week, representing more than the entire Democratic field has spent on TV advertising in the race so far, excluding businessman Tom Steyer, who will have aired nearly $63 million of TV ads by the end of Bloomberg\u2019s initial bookings. A 77-year-old entrepreneur and philanthropist, Bloomberg made his fortune creating technology that bankers and traders use to access market data. After building a successful financial information business, he turned to politics. He officially launched a bid to become mayor of New York in 2001. Despite running as a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, Bloomberg won the election and was reelected twice. During this second term, he switched parties and became an independent \u2013 only to re-register as a Democrat in 2018. Because of his late entry, aides to the former mayor have said he won\u2019t compete in the first four voting contests, in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Instead, Bloomberg is staking his chances on an unconventional strategy of building support in the states that hold primaries on March 3, also known as Super Tuesday. Here are the 17 Democrats who are running for president It\u2019s a strategy that has never been successful in Democratic presidential politics. Party officials in Iowa and New Hampshire have publicly expressed disappointment with Bloomberg\u2019s decision. Bloomberg can tout his recent efforts advancing causes important to Democratic voters. He\u2019s put his significant financial resources behind efforts to defend reproductive rights and to tackle climate change and gun violence. He spent more than $100 million to help the party take control of the House during the 2018 midterm elections and, more recently, contributed to important state races in Virginia. But a Bloomberg candidacy could face several challenges, including countering the narrative that progressive candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have already set: that billionaires shouldn\u2019t be able to \u201cbuy elections.\u201d It may also be difficult for Bloomberg to meet the polling and donor thresholds to make it onto debate stages. Michael Bloomberg and the tradition of expecting black forgiveness The first opportunity for Bloomberg to make the debate stage will be in December, when those Democrats who meet the DNC\u2019s thresholds - receiving 4% in at least four national or early state polls that meet the DNC\u2019s criteria or 6% in two early state polls and receiving donations from at least 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 from at least 20 different states - gather in Los Angeles on December 19. That could be a difficult climb for the former mayor, who only has until December 12 to reach the thresholds, but Steyer - who spent millions on digital ads to drum up the needed smaller dollar donations - proved it is possible. This criticism of Bloomberg grew over the weekend when it became clear that Bloomberg was slated to spend tens of millions of dollars on ads at the outset of his campaign. \u201cI see this as one more example where how come when you have someone who is already a multimillionaire in the White House do you think that the people in this country are going to go, \u2018Oh, we need someone wealthier,\u2019\u201d Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in New Hampshire on Saturday. And California Sen. Kamala Harris turned Bloomberg\u2019s entry into a call for campaign finance reform. \u201cListen, we got to get money out of politics,\u201d she told an audience in Iowa. \u201cI mean, I got to raise a ton of money to be competitive.\u201d Then there\u2019s his past support for \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d a type of aggressive policing that allowed \u2013 critics say encouraged \u2013 officers to detain a person on virtually any type of vague suspicion. After defending it for years, Bloomberg apologized last week at a predominantly African American church for implementing the controversial policy. Some questioned the timing of his backtrack on the issue as he made moves toward a presidential run. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting timing that the mayor would apologize for that now,\u201d said one of his rivals for the nomination, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. Bloomberg had flirted with jumping into the crowded contest for months in 2018 and early 2019.  During that time, he crisscrossed the country, holding events in early-voting states that ranged from visiting factory workers in New Hampshire to hosting a premiere of his climate change documentary in Iowa. It had looked like the beginning of a campaign. About a year ago, Bloomberg\u2019s longtime adviser Kevin Sheekey said they were building a team, including hiring former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, among others. But in March, Bloomberg said he wasn\u2019t running. Instead, the former mayor said he wanted to double down on his efforts to attack climate change and gun violence. \u201cI\u2019ve come to realize that I\u2019m less interested in talking than doing,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece that was published in Bloomberg News.

            "article_content": "Democrats will win majorities in Virginia\u2019s House and Senate on Tuesday, CNN projects, giving the party full control of the state\u2019s government for the first time in more than two decades. The victories put Gov. Ralph Northam and Democrats in the Legislature in position to pursue a progressive agenda \u2013 including gun control measures, which majority Republicans had blocked, and a higher minimum wage. Democrat Andy Beshear claims victory in Kentucky governor race With the \u201ctrifecta\u201d of the House, Senate and governor\u2019s office, Democrats will also control the redistricting process after the 2020 census, drawing the new maps for congressional and state legislative districts. The result on Tuesday night was a continuation of the years-long collapse of the GOP in what until recently had been a swing state. Virginia voted for George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election and elected Republican Bob McDonnell governor in 2009, but the state has backed Democratic presidential and gubernatorial candidates since those elections. The victories completed a Democratic comeback in the state Legislature that began in 2017, when Democrats made major gains in the Legislature, largely through suburban districts, and Northam won handily in an early sign of backlash over Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. That election left the GOP with a 51-49 House majority and a 21-19 advantage in the Senate, and Democrats immediately began targeting legislative seats in hopes of winning control this year. Northam said Wednesday those recent wins in the state contributed to the Democrats\u2019 victories on Tuesday. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Washington right now, no doubt, it\u2019s a factor. And then, you know the gun violence issue in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We had a tremendous tragedy back in May,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day\u201d referencing the mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May that left 12 people dead. \u201cI think they\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we as Democrats have made over the last couple of years and they really want us to continue working on that progress.\u201d Another factor, he said, is House Democrats\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. \u201cThis President has been an embarrassment to this country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sold ourselves to other countries, our allies. I mean it\u2019s just one thing after another and I think it\u2019s catching up with him. Certainly was a factor.\u201d Democratic Sen. Dick Saslaw, a veteran lawmaker, strode to the podium at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Richmond on Tuesday night, telling the packed ballroom, \u201cThomas Jefferson told me there\u2019d be nights like this.\u201d Many Democrats attributed Tuesday night\u2019s energy to a main source: Trump. \u201cThe temporary occupant of the White House and with his tweets, that made a difference,\u201d said Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, the current Democratic House leader and the person poised to become the first female speaker of the House. \u201cThat energized the base.\u201d Republicans conceded Trump\u2019s influence loomed large as well. Chris Jankowski, a GOP strategist advising candidates in several competitive districts, said that Trump fatigue and concerns about gun violence played a big role in Democrats carrying the day. \u201cTrump and guns were the difference,\u201d Jankowski said. Democrats were also not afraid to link the results in Virginia to the next big race on the calendar, arguing that the rejection of Trump and his policies here portend trouble for Republicans across the country in 2020. \u201cDonald Trump is too much,\u201d said Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. \u201cIt\u2019s not really leadership, it\u2019s just the shenanigans and the corruption. We\u2019re done with it. And that\u2019s why you see a blue wave tonight, one that will continue right into next election.\u201d The new base of power in Richmond will certainly lead to a whole host of issues in Virginia getting a second look. Progressive issues like the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, a boost to the state\u2019s minimum wage, the expansion of reproductive rights and tighter gun control laws were all promises made by Democratic leaders Tuesday night. But Republicans were already warning with this newfound power, Democrats could fundamentally re-shape Virginia in way that many voters might not expect. And they promised to not go down without a fight. \u201cWe will fight that agenda at every turn, but with unchecked control of both Houses and a governor still desperately seeking rehabilitation, we will have our work cut out for us,\u201d said Del. Todd Gilbert, the current House majority leader. \u201cOne thing is for certain, Democrats will completely own the results of the next two years.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders apologized again on Thursday to the women who have come forward in recent weeks to allege they were sexually harassed while working for his 2016 presidential campaign. His apology marks the second time in eight days Sanders has publicly expressed regrets over the charges and pointed to steps his 2018 Senate campaign took to ensure a more robust reporting structure. On Wednesday, CNN reported his former presidential  campaign manager Jeff Weaver would not return in that role if Sanders runs in 2020. The apology also comes as the Vermont senator\u2019s allies fret over his ability to effectively communicate what they describe as his sincere distress over the substance of the revelations. Sanders was asked at a news conference on Thursday about a Politico report which revealed allegations that Robert Becker, an operative who worked for the campaign in Iowa and Michigan and other states, forcibly kissed a subordinate who had previously worked with him. He began by lauding the political successes of the 2016 campaign, but then quickly transitioned to an apology, thanking \u201cfrom the bottom of my heart\u201d the women who were \u201charassed or mistreated\u201d for speaking out. \u201cWhat they experienced was absolutely unacceptable, and certainly not what a progressive campaign or any campaign should be about,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhen we talk about \u2013 and I do all of the time \u2013 ending sexism, and ending all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words. That, they must be based in day to day reality and in the work that we do. And that was not the case, clearly not the case, in the 2016 campaign.\u201d He also discussed the changes to his political operation that followed the 2016 presidential bid, ahead of his successful 2018 re-election to the Senate, saying \u201cwe established some of the strongest sexual harassment policies in the country,\u201d including \u201ctraining for all employees on this issue and also an opportunity for any woman who believed that she was harassed to be able to call an independent human resources firm outside of the campaign to voice her concerns.\u201d Sanders denied having any knowledge of a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement from the 2016 campaign, reported by Politico, involving two former staffers and tied to Becker, who denied the allegations in a text to CNN. On January 2, following a New York Times report in which several female employees from the 2016 campaign alleged sexual harassment, disparities in pay and a workplace environment they described as either uncomfortable or inappropriate, Sanders first apologized in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cI am not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right in terms of human resources, in terms of addressing the needs that I\u2019m hearing from now, that women felt they were disrespected, that there was sexual harassment which was not dealt with as effectively as possible,\u201d he said. Jeff Weaver will not return as Bernie Sanders' campaign manager in 2020 But Sanders\u2019 reply when asked if he had been aware of the issues at the time \u2013 he had been \u201ca little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case,\u201d he said \u2013 worried allies who were concerned that those words would undermine the apology. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the senator took (the reports) seriously. Whether or not that kind of curt remark was necessary to say? It probably was not necessary to say,\u201d close aide and Our Revolution president Nina Turner told CNN earlier this week. \u201cBut the main thing that he said, that I apologize and my Senate campaign took steps based on what we learned from 2016, and we plan to do even more \u2013 that is what you want somebody to say.\u201d For both Sanders and his team, the spate of allegations have brought front and center both political and organizational challenges awaiting them if, as many believe is likely, he chooses to enter the Democratic primary. \u201cIf he decides to run again, Bernie would have to have a campaign structure which is much more robust with a much bigger leadership team,\u201d Weaver, slated to become a senior strategic adviser if Sanders runs, said on Wednesday. \u201cIt would have to be much more diverse than was the case in 2016, when it was too male and too white.\u201d Outside loyalists \u2013 including a number of whom are either ideological and political allies or former staffers who support Sanders\u2019 agenda \u2013 who spoke to CNN were uniformly insistent that Sanders takes the mistreatment faced by women on his campaign, along with the broader related issues, seriously, even if they doubted his ability to effectively convey it. \u201cIn 2020, we\u2019re going to see how much Bernie has grown from his own limitations in 2016,\u201d Waleed Shahid of the progressive Justice Democrats, which formed out of Sanders\u2019 campaign and recruited New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run in 2018. \u201cCan he speak to this constituency of Democrats who really care about sexual harassment and Me Too, who really care about reproductive rights being under attack, that really care about police killings of black men and women and supporting athletes like Colin Kaepernick? It\u2019s all wrapped up in the same thing of, can you authentically speak to these identity and social movements?\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s taken lots of steps toward doing that,\u201d Shahid said, \u201cbut it is always going to be something that he needs to work on.\u201d Progressive strategist Rebecca Katz cautioned that Sanders had time to improve his posture. \u201cIt\u2019s January of 2019. There is a long road ahead. His first time out after the news was known was not a good answer,\u201d she said. \u201cHis tweet today was good. His actual answer showed improvement.\u201d Katz also stressed that the behavior on the Sanders campaign in 2016 was not \u201cunique to Bernie.\u201d \u201cMaybe the incompetence in how they handled it (on the campaign) was, but this stuff has been going on for decades. Frankly, it\u2019s that more people have voices now and they are exercising their voice and that\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cTeam Sanders now has to show how the culture there has changed.\u201d But as political matter, the concerns over Sanders\u2019 capacity to win over voters outside his core of support have for some progressives come into sharper focus over the last couple weeks. One progressive political strategist and consultant who has worked with Our Revolution and who requested anonymity to speak candidly about a sensitive subject expressed anxiety over what the strategist viewed as a rhetorical blindspot. \u201cI\u2019m worried that there\u2019s a chance that Bernie damages the social democratic cause long-term by not being conversant in gender and sexuality and race,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s bad on these issues \u2013 that critique is BS, he\u2019s actively to the left on almost every single substantive policy issue \u2013 but because our system is so individual-focused, he risks giving the people who oppose him on those issues so much ammo.\u201d",

He co-hosts the podcast \u201cWords Matter.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. The debate among the Democratic presidential candidates about universal health coverage calls to mind a couple of political truths. First, most things that sound too good to be true are, in fact, not true. Second, if you want to take away a public benefit, you\u2019d better have a good replacement for it first. Three candidates are for full-blown Medicare for All, which means eliminating all employer-provided private insurance. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Bill de Blasio argue that only this fundamental restructuring of our health care system will cover all Americans. The idea seems popular on the surface. According to a poll from the Kaiser Foundation, 56% of Americans say they support full Medicare for All. But when respondents are told important details about the plan \u2013  like how much it costs, and how it abolishes private insurance \u2014 that number slips. In similar polls, when voters are presented with the full details of the Sanders and Warren plans, support falls dramatically. A poll done by David Binder for Third Way found a dramatic drop when factoring in the cost, the increase in payroll tax to pay for it, and the potential for the GOP-controlled Congress to have ultimate control of health care decisions including reproductive rights.  That last piece of info drops support for the program to only 23% of Americans. You can expect the Trump campaign to spend a lot of time and money exposing Medicare for All as too good to be true. But the main reason most of the Democratic field is not with Sanders and Warren has to do with that second rule of politics. The Medicare for All bill is a winner Both Sanders and Warren would advocate taking away the benefit of employer based private insurance \u2013 before anyone begins to receive the tangible benefit of going to full blown Medicare for All. And Americans\u2019 first encounter with such a program would be those higher payroll taxes. Perhaps some think that employers, relieved of providing insurance coverage, will pass along those savings to employees to help ease the burden of increased payroll taxes. But where is the evidence of such corporate behavior, particularly in the aftermath of the Trump corporate tax cut? Stock buybacks aren\u2019t going to help people faced with higher tax rates. Most in the Democratic field are mindful of these realities, and favor what Mayor Pete Buttigieg calls Medicare for those who want it. They differ on the details, but the concept is that voters should have a choice:  they can keep their employer-based private insurance or pay into Medicare at a much cheaper rate. Joe Biden told Chris Cuomo that the right way is to build on Obamacare, not to abandon it. Sanders on role of private insurance in Medicare for All Now if you were around in 2009-2010, it\u2019s hard sometimes to think of Obamacare as popular. But despite relentless Republican attacks, the benefits provided \u2013 guaranteed insurance and coverage of pre-existing conditions \u2013  are now seen by many as a benefit to which they\u2019re entitled. Moving to Medicare for those who want it is a logical next step toward a single-payer option, one that maintains choice for millions of Americans. As much attention as Medicare for All gets, as proposed by Senators Sanders and Warren it is a political loser.  Note that Senator Kamala Harris has yet to make up her mind on this subject. I believe it\u2019s critical for Democrats to maintain their advantage on health care going into 2020, and the best way to do that is to reject Medicare for All and embrace Medicare for those who want it.  To put it more starkly, Democrats should listen to one of the most respected Democratic political scientists, William Galston. He told the Wall Street Journal, \u201cIf Democrats back single-payer health care, it could assure Trump\u2019s re-election.\u201d  Medicare for All may eventually be good policy, but for now it\u2019s bad politics and risks what should be the number one goal of all Democrats: to remove Donald Trump at the ballot box and get to work undoing the damage he\u2019s done to the country.",
