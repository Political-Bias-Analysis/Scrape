            "article_content": "Voters in Albuquerque rejected a ballot initiative to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy It is the first known instance the issue of abortion has been addressed at such a local level. Social movements often start at the grass-roots level, rather than the less-pliable federal level The failed referendum in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy is the first known instance of the issue being addressed at a local level, but it might not be the last. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see this more and more,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, communications director for Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly doing things on the local level in terms of outreach because those methods are very effective in bringing about social change in general,\u201d said Tara Shaver, who with her husband, Bud, is with the group Project Defending Life. Albuquerque voters reject late-term abortion ban Texas abortion restrictions overturned Marijuana legalization and American teens The Shavers call themselves \u201cfull-time pro-life missionaries.\u201d They moved to Albuquerque three years ago, after waging an anti-abortion battle in Kansas, because Albuquerque has one of the few abortion clinics in the country to perform abortions beyond 20 weeks. Tara Shaver said the state legislature has repeatedly refused to take up a parental notification measure, one of the most basic steps for abortion opponents. The legislature \u201cnever gives our bill the time of day,\u201d she told CNN. After watching a successful local campaign to place a minimum wage increase on the Albuquerque ballot in 2012, Shaver became inspired. She thought something similar could be done with abortion. It worked. After collecting 27,000 signatures of support, the measure got its own special election. While this is the first time a city has voted on whether to restrict abortions, the idea is not new. Social movements often start at the grass-roots level as cities and localities often shift more quickly than the federal government. That\u2019s where the movement to legalize marijuana got its start. \u201cReformers have always used local referenda and initiative,\u201d Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law, said. Built on principles from the anti-Vietnam War protests, activists seized on a Nixon-era report that criticized the criminalization of marijuana. The report went nowhere at the federal level as Nixon was adamantly opposed to its findings, but activists used the report to organize in cities and towns in all 50 states, St. Pierre said. University towns, especially in the Midwest, including Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Madison, Wisconsin, acted to decriminalize pot. It became a trend and is still happening today. In this past election, three cities in Michigan voted to legalize pot. Although the vote was largely symbolic, it shows that local can still lead the way. Smoke clears for attitudes on pot, voters respond It\u2019s an effort \u201cto get around recalcitrant legislators who don\u2019t want to even introduce bills,\u201d St. Pierre said. Another Midwest town played a central role in the lesbian and gay movement as well. East Lansing, Michigan, was the first place in the country to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. That was in the early \u201970s. Forty years later, Congress has still been unable to pass an LGBT workplace anti-discrimination bill. Sarah Warbelow, state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign, said her group \u201cworks with municipalities all the time\u201d to pass and implement LGBT rights measures. Pro-choice advocates, however, caution the anti-abortion activists from overstepping and trying to chip away at settled law. \u201cWhat we\u2019re actually seeing because of the groundswell of anti-abortion overreach, we\u2019re seeing the entire movement put into an offensive posture,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. She added that Roe v. Wade is settled law and any attempt to roll back abortion access will get caught up in litigation. But the tactic also appeals to anti-abortion activists who hope the courts roll back Roe v. Wade. \u201cWe are more than happy,\u201d Shaver said, \u201cto assist\u2026 and encourage people in the cities who have problems with state legislatures.\u201d And an activist has already begun the process to ban late-term abortions in Valencia, a county neighboring Albuquerque.",

If the referendum passes, it is sure to be challenged in court. But it also may serve as a template for the next front on the anti-abortion battle. Referenda that have put abortion on the ballot has been tried on the state level. But what Albuquerque will do Tuesday makes it unique among cities. At the heart of the matter is a downtown clinic that is one of handful in the country that performs late-term abortions. Over the summer, anti-abortion activists gathered thousands of signatures to force a special election that will ban abortions after 20 weeks \u2013 and make no exception in the case of rape, incest. It does make an exception if the pregnant woman\u2019s life is at risk. \u201cWe are really thinking strategically how to bypass the legislature,\u201d said Tara Shavers. \u201cThat\u2019s where our pro-life bills go and never make it out from committee.  We call them \u2018kill committees.\u2019\u201d Shavers and her husband run a ministry called \u201cProject Defending Life\u201d that was instrumental in gathering the signatures that prompted the referendum. The wording of the ordinance says \u201cunborn children\u201d can feel pain after 20 weeks. \u201cThis election has national implications,\u201d Shavers said. \u201cWe are in a blue state in a blue city.  This is the ultimate test.\u201d In early voting, which ended Friday, about 43,900 people cast ballots, according to the Albuquerque Journal. That\u2019s more than the 26,208 who voted in last month\u2019s mayoral election. Both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups have plastered the airwaves and newspapers with ads, making their case.

            "article_content": "Thousands of people attend state Senate hearing on Texas abortion bill in Austin Bill would ban abortions after 20 weeks, tighten requirements for clinics that perform procedure The Legislature is in special session after Sen. Wendy Davis successfully filibustered the bill The divisiveness of the abortion debate was on full display in the Texas statehouse Monday as SB1, also known as the fetal pain bill, was opened to public comment by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. Thousands began lining up early in the morning, and the testimony was expected to last more than 16 hours. The measure seeks to ban abortions after 20 weeks of gestation, the point at which some claim fetuses begin to feel pain. Republican state Sen. Bob Deuell acknowledged that there are conflicting opinions in the medical community about fetal pain but remains a firm supporter of the bill.  \u201cAre we willing to take a chance that a baby at 20 weeks can feel pain? There was little to no middle ground in the debate. Those in favor of abortion rights accused Republicans of creating a bill based on religion rather than science. Anti-abortion activists accuse the other side of using personal liberty to justify infanticide. Throughout the day the committee called upon dozens of speakers, seating those with opposing views right next to each other. For anti-abortion activists such as Lady Teresa Toms, the bill doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cGod says, \u2018I knew you before you were even knitted in your mother\u2019s womb.\u2019 That baby is a baby from the beginning.  There is no way that you need scientific evidence to know that that baby feels pain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have laws on the books now that say if you murder a pregnant woman you are charged with two murders \u2026 so what is the difference here?\u201d But for Sarah Shimmer, the bill is an egregious violation of women\u2019s rights.  \u201cI am a Republican woman, but regardless of what my personal beliefs and experiences are, my personal reproductive choices do not give me the right to restrict other women.\u201d In addition to banning abortions after 20 weeks, the bill would require clinics that provide abortions to become ambulatory surgical centers; would tighten guidelines for administering the drug RU486, which can terminate early pregnancies; and would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they\u2019re providing abortion services. Critics of the measure said it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas, denying access to many, while proponents say it would raise the standard of care for women. The initial bill failed on June 25 after a dramatic day and night in which state Sen. Wendy Davis, a Democrat, talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on the legislative session. But Gov. Rick Perry called a special session so the legislature could take up the measure again.  Perry\u2019s announcement that he would not be running for re-election fueled speculation about whether Davis can help rejuvenate the Texas Democratic party, which hasn\u2019t won a statewide election since 1994. Davis has not yet announced any plans and released a statement congratulating Perry on his lifetime of public service adding, \u201cI feel confident the next campaign will sort itself out in due time.\u201d Planned Parenthood was quick to condemn the governor in a statement: \u201cRick Perry has done more to hurt women than any governor in history. Perry\u2019s legacy is endangering women\u2019s health in order to score political points with the far-right tea party fringe.\u201d The Senate committee is expected to vote on the bill after the House version of the bill is brought to the floor. That is expected to happen Tuesday, when the legislature reconvenes.",

The only unknown was what he would say in his victory speech. The tough-talking Republican headliner has the most buzz of any potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate and he created more by delivering a speech that was aimed at both New Jersey and a national audience. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t just show up six months before an election. You show up four years before one.  And you don\u2019t just take no for an answer the first time no has happened.  You keep going back and trying more,\u201d Christie told the audience in Asbury Park. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos called Christie\u2019s address \u201can announcement speech.\u201d And it will only serve to stir up more speculation that despite his saying that he\u2019s seriously considering a run in 2016, his mind is already made up. CNN exit polls show Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats. Exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 57% of the female vote and winning all age groups other than those 18-29. Christie also took a fifth of the African-American vote and half - 51% - of Latinos, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections. McAuliffe narrowly wins Virginia Christie to Obama: 'Don't be so cute' Piers Morgan defends Gov. Chris Christie Dancing with the de Blasios Overall, Christie bested his little-known Democratic challenger, Barbara Buono, by a 60%-38% margin with about 99% of the vote counted. Virginia and New Jersey are the only two states that hold elections for governor in the year after a presidential contest. And Virginia\u2019s race provided the only real drama as votes were counted. Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton confidant, trailed Republican state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli through the evening until votes from Democratic strongholds started rolling in and propelled him to victory. A complete list of election results The race was nasty from the get-go and devolved into incessant mudslinging and personal attacks. Voters throughout the commonwealth of Virginia were bombarded by negative ads and polling showed that neither candidate was particularly well-liked by the people who would be voting for them. With nearly all of the vote counted, McAuliffe held a 48%-45% margin over Cuccinelli. Libertarian Robert Sarvis pulled in about 7% of the vote, which could have made the difference. In New York City, the race for mayor was never in question, either, as Democrat Bill de Blasio defeated Republican Joe Lhota, by a 73%-24% margin with 91% of the vote in, making the city\u2019s public advocate the first Democrat to lead the nation\u2019s largest city in a generation. In Alabama, an establishment candidate defeated a tea party-backed candidate in a Republican primary runoff for the congressional seat from Alabama\u2019s 1st district, which had been seen as precursor of intra-Republican party contests in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Bradley Byrne, a former state senator, defeated businessman Dean Young in the race by a  52%-48% margin with all of the vote in. The contest was the first time Republican voters could weigh in on which direction they want to take their party after the partial federal government shutdown in October was laid largely at the feet of tea party instigators in Congress. Exit polls: Christie and McAuliffe took different paths to victory Here\u2019s a closer look at some of the night\u2019s most interesting races and ballot measures: A nasty race in purple Virginia The McAuliffe and Cuccinelli campaigns engaged in nasty political warfare with McAuliffe making sure that women were aware of Cuccinelli\u2019s support of \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation that critics say restricts abortion and some forms of birth control, while Cuccinelli frequently highlighted federal investigations of an electric car company that McAuliffe co-founded. McAuliffe and Democrats pinned Cuccinelli as a tea party activist, linking him to conservative lawmakers in Washington who initiated a strategy that eventually led to the  government shutdown. Take a closer look at the Virginia race What does Christie\u2019s win say about 2016? While much of his address was directed at his New Jersey audience, Christie also had a message for the nation. \u201cI know tonight, a dispirited America, angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington, looks to New Jersey to say, \u2018Is what I think happening really happening? Are people really coming together. Are we really working, African-Americans and Hispanics, suburbanites and city dwellers, farmers and teachers. Are we really all working together.\u2019 \u201cLet me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight: Under this government our first job is to get the job done and as long as I\u2019m governor that job will always, always be finished,\u201d More on Christie\u2019s big win NYC picks first Democratic mayor in a generation At the center of the New York mayor\u2019s race were disagreements over taxes and the city\u2019s controversial \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d program backed by incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten, an idea Lhota vehemently opposed. Go deeper on the NYC race Deep-pocketed Republicans pick winner in Alabama Byrne, the establishment candidate, far outraised Young, the tea party candidate, thanks to major help from the business wing of the party, including the Chamber of Commerce. He also garnered endorsements from establishment figures, including several Republican House leaders. However, despite support for smaller tea party personalities, Young was largely ignored by the national tea party groups. Tea Party Express, Club For Growth and FreedomWorks \u2013 three of the largest national tea party groups \u2013 sat on the sidelines of the intra-party fight. Establishment beats tea party in Alabama runoff Also on the ballot New York is not the only major city that held a mayoral contest on Tuesday. Voters in Boston, Seattle, Detroit and Cleveland  also elected mayors. And voters in six states weighed in on 31 ballot measures. Colorado voters overwhelmingly approved the marijuana tax 65% to 35%. Washington voters rejected genetically modified food labeling with 55% of voters opposing it. And New Jersey voters agreed to increase the minimum wage. Voters in 11 Colorado counties also voted on a Colorado succession measure.

Christie steamrolled hapless Democratic nominee Barbara Buono, 60% to 39% with 80% of the vote counted, crushing her in almost every key demographic.  It was the biggest victory for a GOP gubernatorial candidate in New Jersey since Tom Kean was running in the 1980s. What Christie\u2019s victory means for 2016 McAuliffe\u2019s victory was much narrower than most of the polls indicated, 48% to 46% with 98% of the vote in.  He didn\u2019t win every key group \u2013 self-described independents broke for Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli \u2013 but he successfully stoked fears about Cuccinelli\u2019s strident brand of conservatism in an increasingly moderate battleground state. Christie wins New Jersey governor's race Christie to Obama: 'Don't be so cute' Christie: GOP needs to focus on winning Christie: Romney embarrassed about leak Let\u2019s start with New Jersey. Christie beat his female opponent among women by 16 points.  He won self-described moderates by more than 20 points.  He won independents by more than 30 points.  He won voters making less than $50,000.  He won voters making more than $100,000. Check the exit poll: N.J. governor\u2019s race Christie did very well for a Republican with core Democratic constituencies.  He won 49% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29.  He won roughly three in 10 self-described liberals.  He won 50% of the Hispanic vote.  And he won roughly 20% of the African-American vote. These are all critical selling points for Republicans hungry to take back the White House in 2016. If there\u2019s one warning sign for Christie\u2019s 2016 hopes, it\u2019s the fact that the exit polls show he would lose his home state to Hillary Clinton by four points.  That doesn\u2019t fit with the narrative that he\u2019s a Republican capable of winning in blue America. Half of New Jersey voters said Christie would make a good president.  But that doesn\u2019t mean 50% of New Jersey voters would necessarily back him if he runs for the White House. Christie will have to walk a fine line over the next couple of years, bolstering his standing among national GOP primary voters while maintaining his credibility with more independent and Democratic-leaning voters.  Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney couldn\u2019t do it. As for Virginia, McAuliffe won by getting his base to the polls.  Democrats were the biggest partisan voting bloc in the state, comprising 37% of the total electorate and backing the former Democratic National Committee chairman by a 93-point margin. McAuliffe hit Cuccinelli hard during the campaign on hot button social issues like abortion, and the strategy paid off.  Cuccinelli actually won among the 72% of voters who cared most about the economy or health care.  But among the 20% of voters who called abortion the most important issue, McAuliffe won by 25 points, 59%-34%. Check the exit poll: Va. governor\u2019s race Half  of Virginia voters called Cuccinelli\u2019s issue positions too conservative.  Only 41% called McAuliffe\u2019s positions too liberal. In the end, Cuccinelli was hurt by the same tea party alliance that won him the nomination at the Virginia GOP convention earlier this year.  Only 28% of Virginia voters said they support the tea party movement.  Forty-two percent said they oppose it, and they broke for McAuliffe by more than 70 points. And no, Cuccinelli can\u2019t blame his loss on scandal-plagued outgoing GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell or third-party libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis. Despite his scandals, Virginia voters said they approve of McDonnell\u2019s job performance by 11 points, 52% to 41%.  And if Sarvis had not been in the race, exit polls indicate McAuliffe still would have beaten Cuccinelli by two points, 48% to 46%. 5 things we learned from Election Night",

Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the longtime political fixer and moneyman, hasn\u2019t trailed in a poll since May. Barring a political miracle, Republican Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a concession speech on Tuesday evening in Richmond. In recent cycles, the Virginia race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment. Four years ago, Republican Bob McDonnell won in blowout fashion, a victory that presaged the following year\u2019s GOP midterm wave. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governor\u2019s mansion, tapping into anxiety about President George W. Bush\u2019s handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. Not so this year. The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns. But despite the lack of late fireworks, there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the Virginia campaign.

The 2012 playbook is still potent for Democrats McAuliffe isn\u2019t exactly squeaky-clean. A longtime wheeler-dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns, \u201cthe Macker\u201d has a history of eyebrow-raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder. The opposition research book on the former Democratic National Committee chairman is as thick a Virginia live oak. But Democrats have successfully turned the race into a referendum on Cuccinelli, defining him over the summer as a right-wing zealot. A Washington Post poll last week showed that two-thirds of McAuliffe supporters said they were voting against Cuccinelli, rather than for McAuliffe. How did the Dems do it? With a relentless focus on Cuccinelli\u2019s conservative record on women\u2019s health issues, a playbook that President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign employed to great effect in 2012 against GOP nominee Mitt Romney. And Romney was never as conservative as Cuccinelli. Obama campaigns for McAuliffe in Virginia \u201cIt is impossible to be the candidate of the tea party and still be the candidate of the center,\u201d argued McAuliffe\u2019s pollster, Geoff Garin. In TV ad after TV ad, voters in this swing state were told of Cuccinelli\u2019s record on abortion, contraception and domestic violence. Some of the claims were stretches maybe, but welcome to politics. At the same time, McAuliffe \u201cseized the center,\u201d his campaign aides say, drawing some business-friendly Republican politicians and a few GOP donors to his side. The message from Republicans has been muddy. One week, they were hitting McAuliffe over a sputtering car company he founded, and the next they were calling attention to his attempts to expand a business venture in China. Thoughout the race, Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign has called McAuliffe \u201cdeeply unserious\u201d \u2013 even running a memorable ad with a clip of McAuliffe downing a shot of rum on live television \u2013 but none of the attacks seemed to stick. The unwavering Democratic assault has worked. Romney lost the state last year while losing women by 9 points. The gender gap is much worse for Cuccinelli. In some polls, Cuccinelli trails McAuliffe among women by more than 20 points. That\u2019s a huge problem in a state where more than half of voters in 2012 were women, many of them from the moderate Washington suburbs. 2. Democrats are outspending Republicans It doesn\u2019t happen often in campaigns, but Democrats have already won the money war in Virginia. It helps that McAuliffe is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most prolific fundraisers, running in a state with porous campaign finance laws. He\u2019s collected more than $34 million this cycle, tapping a deep donor Rolodex dating back to the Bill Clinton years that includes media executive Haim Saban, California business maven Ron Burkle and Silicon Valley golden boy Sean Parker. Labor unions have also been generous contributors. Cuccinelli has collected much less this year, nearly $20 million. One reason for the smaller haul: A number of reliable Republican donors, anxious about Cuccinelli\u2019s social agenda, have held back their support. Some have even raised money for McAuliffe, including the Virginia homebuilder Dwight Schar, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman who supported McDonnell during his 2009 campaign. The same tale is true with outside groups. Liberal outfits such as the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood and NextGen Climate Action have ponied up big for McAuliffe, while their counterparts on the right have been far less generous. Democrats have vastly outspent Republicans on the television airwaves. Last week, McAuliffe and his Democratic allies outspent Cuccinelli and Republicans on TV by a four to one margin, according to a Democrat familiar with ad spending in the race. Cuccinelli has relied on the backing of the Republican Governors Association, one of the country\u2019s better-funded campaign committees, but its Democratic counterparts managed to keep pace. The RGA spent $8 million on the race, while the Democratic Governors Association put in $6.5 million, lending a crucial lifeline to the McAuliffe campaign earlier this year when their cash flow wasn\u2019t as hot. 3. Cuccinelli is betting on conservative turnout The Cuccinelli campaign\u2019s slogan in the final weeks of the race might as well be \u201cindependents be damned.\u201d Trailing McAuliffe among independent voters by a 15-point margin, and doing even worse with women voters, Cuccinelli has spent the fall trying to stir the passions of the Republican base in hopes that fired-up conservatives could make up the difference a low turnout, nonpresidential election in which Democrats stay home. In the closing days, Cuccinelli is trying to turn the race into a referendum on the Affordable Care Act, a still-controversial law that\u2019s suffering from enrollment problems. But he\u2019s been trying to rally the right for weeks, giving interviews to conservative media outlets and bringing in an all-star team of Republican surrogates to join him on the campaign trail. Among the team players who\u2019ve made the trip to Old Dominion: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Cuccinelli is also trying to bring libertarian voters back into the fold by campaigning with former Texas Rep. Ron Paul on Monday. A libertarian candidate, Robert Sarvis, has performed surprisingly well in the polls, and it\u2019s hurting Cuccinelli, whose crusading social conservative views don\u2019t exactly square with the limited-government crowd. Polls show Republicans slightly less supportive of Cuccinelli than Democrats are of McAuliffe. Cuccinelli\u2019s closing strategy is a fitting one. He captured the GOP nomination at a party convention in May, nominated by a small batch of the party\u2019s most hard-core conservative activists. Now he\u2019s counting on them to finish what they started. 4. The real action is down-ballot With Democrats bullish on their chances at winning the governorship and the lieutenant governor\u2019s race \u2013 in which Republicans nominated a long-shot candidate, the fiery former pastor E.W. Jackson \u2013 close watchers of the campaign are eyeing the attorney general\u2019s race, shaping up to be Tuesday\u2019s only real toss-up. Democrats haven\u2019t swept all three statewide offices in Virginia since 1989, when L. Douglas Wilder became the nation\u2019s first African-American governor. It could happen again this year. The AG race is a dogfight between two state senators, Democrat Mark Herring and Republican Mark Obenshain, and outside groups have started to inject serious money into the campaign. In some ways, it\u2019s a proxy war between the National Rifle Association and New York City\u2019s anti-gun mayor, Michael Bloomberg. The NRA has funded a TV ad blitz accusing Herring of wanting to curtail gun rights, while a Bloomberg-backed super PAC, Independence USA, has come to Herring\u2019s defense with a $1 million ad campaign painting Obenshain as a conservative extremist. That\u2019s not all. On the GOP side, the Republican State Leadership Committee has pumped nearly $2 million into Obenshain\u2019s coffers. And the Democratic Party of Virginia, content with the state of play in the governor\u2019s race, has spent the final week of the race turning its guns on Obenshain in an effort highlight his conservative voting record in Richmond. 5. It\u2019s the Clintons\u2019 gateway back into politics For almost two decades, McAuliffe has been one of Bill Clinton\u2019s dearest friends and most trusted advisers. The former president campaigned for McAuliffe in 2009, when he made an unsuccessful bid for the governor\u2019s mansion, so it\u2019s no surprise that he got involved again in 2013, hitting every corner of the commonwealth last week in a nine-city swing that drew enthusiastic crowds and generated boatloads of earned media. And Clinton wasn\u2019t shy about using the perch to point out a few of his accomplishments in the White House. Clinton cavalry rides into Virginia But it\u2019s not just Bill: With McAuliffe looking sturdy in the polls down the stretch, the campaign provided Hillary Clinton with a low-risk way to ease back into campaign politics after spending the previous four years traveling the globe as secretary of state. With a possible 2016 presidential bid on the horizon, she made her first overtly political speech at a McAuliffe rally two weeks, drawing almost 600 people, many of them women, to a theater in northern Virginia. Her speech was vintage Hillary, more prose than poetry, but the appearance gave her a chance to get in front of a partisan crowd and test drive some potential campaign themes of her own. The Clintons have also used the Virginia race to get back in the fundraising game, hosting a number of closed-door finance events for McAuliffe and burnishing their relationships with the Democratic donor class in the process.",

            "article_content": "NEW: The establishment candidate beat the tea party candidate in Alabama primary runoff Democrat Terry McAuliffe defeats Ken Cuccinelli in race for Virginia governor, CNN projects Bill de Blasio heads toward becoming first Democrat to lead NYC in 20 years Chris Christie easily takes another term as New Jersey governor Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton confidant, trailed Republican state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli through the evening until votes from Democratic strongholds started rolling in and propelled him to victory. The race was nasty from the get-go and devolved into incessant mudslinging and personal attacks. Voters throughout the commonwealth of Virginia were bombarded by negative ads and polling showed that neither candidate was particularly well-liked by the people who would be voting for them. Libertarian Robert Sarvis, a third-party candidate, has pulled in 7% of the vote with more than 90% of the vote counted. That\u2019s a significant chunk when the Republican and Democratic candidates are so close. McAuliffe will succeed Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who\u2019s not running for re-election because Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms. In New York City, the race for mayor was never in question, either, as Democrat Bill de Blasio defeated Republican Joe Lhota, by a 73%-24% margin with 91% of the vote in, making the city\u2019s public advocate the first Democrat to lead the nation\u2019s largest city in a generation. 5 things to know about this year\u2019s most important race The Big Apple votes for a new mayor Christie wins New Jersey governor's race Key races on Election Day 2013 What a win could mean for Gov. Christie Democrat Bill de Blasio has defeated Republican nominee Joe Lhota in the race for mayor of New York City, CNN projects, making the public advocate the first Democrat to lead the nation\u2019s largest city in 20 years. After de Blasio won the Democratic nomination in a crowded and circus-like field earlier this year, the liberal Democrat\u2019s victory in the general election was never in question. All polls going into the election had de Blasio defeating Lhota in a landslide, with one released Monday indicating de Blasio was ahead of Lhota with likely voters by more than 40%. Earlier Tuesday night, in another long-predicted result, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won four more years leading the Garden State by defeating Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono in the state\u2019s gubernatorial race. Christie\u2019s victory became a forgone conclusion long before polls closed in New Jersey, as public opinion polls for months have indicated the tough-talking Republican headliner was far ahead of his Democratic challenger. There are national implications to the race, too. With Christie considering a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, his re-election campaign is seen as a tuneup or stepping stone for that likely White House bid. According to CNN exit polls of New Jersey voters, Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats. Early exit polls indicate the GOP governor grabbing 56% of the female vote, and winning all age groups other than those 18-29. Christie also took a fifth of the African-American vote and 45% of Latinos, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections. Virginia and New Jersey are the only two states that hold elections for governor in the year after a presidential contest. In Alabama, an establishment candidate defeated a tea party-backed candidate in a Republican primary runoff for the congressional seat from Alabama\u2019s 1st district, which had been seen as precursor of intra-Republican party contests in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Bradley Byrne, a former state senator, defeated businessman Dean Young in the race by a  52%-48% margin with all of the vote in. The contest was the first time Republican voters could weigh in on which direction they want to take their party after the partial federal government shutdown in October was laid largely at the feet of tea party instigators in Congress. Here\u2019s a closer look at some of the night\u2019s most interesting races and ballot measures: A nasty race in purple Virginia The McAuliffe and Cuccinelli campaigns engaged in nasty political warfare with McAuliffe making sure that women were aware of Cuccinelli\u2019s support of \u201cpersonhood\u201d legislation that critics say restricts abortion and some forms of birth control, while Cuccinelli frequently highlighted federal investigations of an electric car company that McAuliffe co-founded. Both sides also attempted to frame the race as a referendum on larger national issues. Cuccinelli\u2019s supporters argued a vote against McAuliffe was a vote against Obamacare. McAuliffe and Democrats pinned Cuccinelli as a tea party activist, linking him to conservative lawmakers in Washington who initiated a strategy that eventually led to the  government shutdown. Take a closer look at the Virginia race What does Christie\u2019s win say about 2016? Christie performed well with groups that normally cast ballots for Democrats. Gingrich: McAuliffe has 'Clinton machine' Analysis: Christie's political future Cory Booker's political future Who is Bill de Blasio? While much of his address was directed at his New Jersey audience, Christie also had a message for the nation. More on Christie\u2019s big win NYC picks first Democratic mayor in a generation At the center of the New York mayor\u2019s race were disagreements over taxes and the city\u2019s controversial \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d program backed by incumbent Mayor Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten, an idea Lhota vehemently opposed. While Lhota painted himself as a fiscal conservative, he sought distance from national Republicans on social issues by reiterating his support of abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Go deeper on the NYC race Deep-pocketed Republicans pick winner in Alabama Byrne, the establishment candidate, far outraised Young, the tea party candidate, thanks to major help from the business wing of the party, including the Chamber of Commerce. He also garnered endorsements from establishment figures, including several Republican House leaders. In total, Byrne has raised nearly $700,000, with substantial donations from business community political action groups and individual business donors. Young, on the other hand, has raised $260,000 and has received donations from a political action committee run by former Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle, a darling of the tea party movement, as well as endorsements from conservative talk show hosts Mark Levin and Erick Erickson. However, despite support for smaller tea party personalities, Young was largely ignored by the national tea party groups. Tea Party Express, Club For Growth and FreedomWorks \u2013 three of the largest national tea party groups \u2013 sat on the sidelines of the intra-party fight.

The embattled Health and Human Services Secretary was the daughter of a Democratic governor of Ohio, then became the daughter-in-law of a Republican Congressman from Kansas. Her husband is a federal magistrate. \u201cYou know, when you\u2019ve got a father and father-in-law who are from different political parties, both outspoken.  \u2026  I think she learned a great deal from that and I think it has served her very well,\u201d says Ron Pollack of the health care advocacy group Families USA. Sebelius will need every ounce of that experience. Aside from Obama, Sebelius has been the most prominent figure associated with Obamacare and, because of that, a top target. Demanding she step down, Republicans have ripped her; Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming called her a \u201claughingstock\u201d who has lost credibility. They won\u2019t go easy on her Wednesday, when she testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about problems with HealthCare.gov, the sign-up website for President Barack Obama\u2019s sweeping health care plan. The website isn\u2019t the only problem: Other parts of the Affordable Care Act have come under fire too, including whether people could have their current insurance policies dropped or how much more they might pay for insurance. Ryan: Sebelius should step down over Obamacare Yet as her critics have stepped up, so has Sebelius. Last week, she crisscrossed the country touting the benefits of Obamacare and teaching people how to take advantage of them. And in an exclusive interview last week with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Sebelius said that \u2013 for all the flak directed her way \u2013 she is eager see this program through and to watch it succeed. \u201c(This is) the job that I came here to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the most important work I\u2019ve ever done in my life, delivering on an historic act, making sure that we have health security for \u2026 millions of Americans.\u201d Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview Sebelius\u2019 Obamacare damage control fuels critics\u2019 fire The health care wars are nothing new to her. A Catholic, she drew the wrath of the Church when, as Governor of Kansas, she vetoed a restrictive anti-abortion bill. But as the nation\u2019s Health Secretary, she made a decision contrary to her pro-choice record, overruling an FDA recommendation to make the \u201cmorning after pill\u201d available over the counter to females under 17. As Governor she tried and failed to finance expanded health coverage through cigarette taxes.  Earlier, as the state\u2019s Insurance Commissioner, she fought to bring premiums down.  But one critic says she drove insurers out of the state. \u201cThere was a significant rise in regulations placed on health care, which drove the cost of providing  health care in Kansas up,\u201d said Todd Tiahrt, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas.  \u201cI think that was the most significant reason, that\u2019s why they departed. They felt like they were in a position where it was not profitable to do business in Kansas. So it limited our choices for health care providers,\u201d Tiahrt said. But Pollack defends Sebelius on that score. \u201cHer first focus is how to help consumers, how to help patients.  And she has been on that side all along,\u201d he says. Born in Cincinnati, Sebelius is the daughter of the late John \u2018Jack\u2019 Gilligan, who served as Ohio\u2019s Governor from 1971 to 1975. They became the first father/daughter pair to serve as governors, with her election in 2002. John Gilligan died in August.  Sebelius\u2019 husband, Gary, is a federal magistrate judge in Kansas. They have two grown sons. Sebelius\u2019s father-in-law, Keith Sebelius, was a conservative Republican congressman from Kansas from 1969 to 1981. One of Keith Sebelius\u2019 top aides was current Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who considers himself a longtime friend of the Sebelius family. But Roberts was among the first members of Congress to call for the Secretary\u2019s resignation. Some Sebelius allies believe Roberts turned on her because he\u2019s got a primary challenge from a tea party-supported candidate.  Roberts spokeswoman Sarah Little denies that. She says Roberts was a longtime opponent of Obamacare, but the \u201clast straw\u201d  for him was when Sebelius went on a public speaking tour just as the rollout calamity began. \u201cWhen the ship was sinking,\u201d Little says.

            "article_content": "The Democratic Party is launching a new initiative to attract women The goal is to widen the advantage the Democrats have with women voters The Republican Party knows it has work to do and has launched its own efforts The Democratic Party is waging a battle. They want to take back the House in the 2014 midterms and maintain their majority in the Senate. And one political front is with women. In recent years the Democratic Party has enjoyed a political advantage with women as more of them have voted for Democrats. The Republican Party admits errors leading to success of female Democrats. For instance, in the last election, Republican candidates, including Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, marginalized women by espousing controversial opinions on rape and abortion. The situation was so crippling that Republican leaders conducted an \u201cautopsy\u201d after the 2012 election to evaluate the party\u2019s shortcomings. Analysis: Tea Party caucus like vampires Rubio: We need Obamacare penalty delay Obamacare hearing dubbed 'monkey court' The image of the white man is something the Republican Party is having trouble breaking. Voters were reminded of the patrician perception just a couple of weeks ago during the government shutdown when House Republican leaders let the press in a meeting to take pictures as they worked. At the long table sat eight men in their shirtsleeves. Not one woman was present. Those examples of images and statements make a difference at the voting booth. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney\u2019s nine-point loss among women to President Barack Obama. Additionally, of the 81 women members of Congress, only 19 are Republican. The story is similar in the Senate. But the Democrats aren\u2019t taking any chances. They don\u2019t want to lose their electoral advantage. Last year, they attacked the Republicans\u2019 anti-choice, anti-Obamacare and anti-higher minimum wage policies as a \u201cwar on women.\u201d This year they are launching a war with women. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, on Friday unveiled the Democratic Women\u2019s Alliance, a new initiative to \u201ctarget, motivate and mobilize women\u201d to vote and run for office. And they are throwing money, resources and staff at the effort. They will conduct polls and gather data directed at women voters, find the forgotten women voters and train women to become involved or run for office. It was rolled out at the 20th anniversary of the DNC\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Forum where House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke as did Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. Republicans are \u201ctrying to reach out to women,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said in a hotel ballroom full of women activists. \u201cIsn\u2019t that adorable?\u201d she smirked. \u201cOutreach is inserting themselves into the most private decisions women make,\u201d she added. Wasserman Schultz\u2019s entire message wasn\u2019t about beating the Republicans. She said that when women sit at the table, they bring solutions. \u201cWe understand the role of compromise. When we\u2019re at the table, government is more responsible,\u201d Wasserman Schultz told the audience, referring to the latest gridlock in Washington that partially shut down the government. \u201cEven with Sarah Palin involved, we could\u2019ve struck an agreement,\u201d the Florida congresswoman said. The return of Sarah Palin Her goals, however, are still specific: Enroll more women into the Democratic Party. Republicans admit that they have some work to do. \u201cWe hurt ourselves,\u201d Republican National Committee spokes woman Kirsten Kukowski told CNN. \u201cBut we need to start fighting back on that narrative,\u201d she added. The RNC has recently launched some of its own initiatives focused on women. One of those programs is Blackboard to Blacktop, an education program to enhance women\u2019s role in the party. In addition, Kurkowski said they must do a better job of pushing back against damaging rhetoric by their candidates. \u201cAll of us need to do a better job,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re being much more conscious of it and tackling it every single day,\u201d she added.",

As Governor she tried and failed to finance expanded health coverage through cigarette taxes.  Earlier, as the state\u2019s Insurance Commissioner, she fought to bring premiums down.  But one critic says she drove insurers out of the state. \u201cThere was a significant rise in regulations placed on health care, which drove the cost of providing  health care in Kansas up,\u201d said Todd Tiahrt, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas.  \u201cI think that was the most significant reason, that\u2019s why they departed. They felt like they were in a position where it was not profitable to do business in Kansas. So it limited our choices for health care providers,\u201d Tiahrt said. But Pollack defends Sebelius on that score. \u201cHer first focus is how to help consumers, how to help patients.  And she has been on that side all along,\u201d he says. Born in Cincinnati, Sebelius is the daughter of the late John \u2018Jack\u2019 Gilligan, who served as Ohio\u2019s Governor from 1971 to 1975. They became the first father/daughter pair to serve as governors, with her election in 2002. John Gilligan died in August.  Sebelius\u2019 husband, Gary, is a federal magistrate judge in Kansas. They have two grown sons. Sebelius\u2019s father-in-law, Keith Sebelius, was a conservative Republican congressman from Kansas from 1969 to 1981. One of Keith Sebelius\u2019 top aides was current Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who considers himself a longtime friend of the Sebelius family. But Roberts was among the first members of Congress to call for the Secretary\u2019s resignation. Some Sebelius allies believe Roberts turned on her because he\u2019s got a primary challenge from a tea party-supported candidate.  Roberts spokeswoman Sarah Little denies that. She says Roberts was a longtime opponent of Obamacare, but the \u201clast straw\u201d  for him was when Sebelius went on a public speaking tour just as the rollout calamity began. \u201cWhen the ship was sinking,\u201d Little says.

            "article_content": "Five things you may have missed about the Supreme Court while the partial government shutdown and the debt ceiling deadline grabs the headlines. 1. Business as usual, sort of The federal courts have maintained \u201cnormal\u201d operations this month, the only part of the federal government to remain fully staffed and functional during the two-weeks and counting partial shutdown. That\u2019s because judicial officials planned ahead, stocking away contingency funds to offset any forced furloughs or reduction of services. But the emergency money runs out at week\u2019s end, and individual courthouses are already planning for the worse. It\u2019s a little known aspect of the judicial system, where the 87 federal judicial districts around the country have a lot of discretion to manage their budgets. Some have defiantly designated all their staff to be \u201cessential,\u201d vowing not to lay off anyone. Others have followed the advice of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and begun readying shutdown plans. \u201cFrustration\u201d is the word judges have said. Part of it has to do with their lack of institutional political clout. The federal courts only comprise a tiny fraction of the federal budget and judges by custom stay out of partisan policy fights. Big money goes before the Supreme Court Five Things - Supreme Court But they don\u2019t like how the other two branches are handling the fiscal crisis in their sphere. And the ongoing \u201csequester\u201d cuts leading to staggered layoffs in past months have exasperated an already tough situation for the courts. Senior Judge Richard Kopf, a Nebraska-based 1992 appointee of President George H.W. Bush, summed up the feeling of many on the bench when he wrote this week in his personal blog: \u201cTell Congress to go to hell \u2013 all federal court employees are essential.\u201d Justices prepare for hot-button cases 2. Race and politics The U.S. Supreme Court is also taking the budget mess day-to-day, and has not canceled any of its public sessions, including Wednesday\u2019s two hours of oral arguments. Its building is one of the few government institutions open to tourists and the general public. But that may change next week if the standoff continues. The justices have not said anything public about the political crisis, and have carried on with their work. They have enough controversy to deal with without messing with budget politics. The clearest example was Tuesday\u2019s arguments on affirmative action. Questions of race and remedies have always touched a nerve with the courts, and the takeout from this appeal may prove disappointing to civil rights activists. The issue is Michigan\u2019s Proposal 2, a voter-approved referendum, that bans race preference in state college admissions. The conservative majority seemed to support the idea the voting public could decide such things, despite the effect it might have on efforts to promote diversity in the classroom. 3. Money and politics For political junkies, it\u2019s never to soon to start thinking about the 2014 mid-term elections, little more than a year away. And for those that provide the fuel of partisan politics \u2013 the billions of dollars in individual donations expected to pour into Republican and Democratic coffers \u2013 all eyes are watching the high court. The justices last week held arguments in a case testing whether Congress can continue to limit the \u201caggregate\u201d or total amount individuals may give to federal candidates and national parties. An Alabama businessman named Shaun McCutcheon has become the new face of campaign finance reform\u2013 both cheered and reviled depending on your views on the case. He claims a First Amendment right to donate to as many federal office seekers as he wants, so long as no one candidate gets more than the $2,600 per election limit. But supporters of existing regulations say the law prevents corruption or the appearance of corruption. They say if the rules are loosened, a well-heeled donor could fork over more than $3 million per election in direct donations. Again, the conservative majority may be poised to strike down or severely weaken the current restrictions, similar to what it did three years ago in the so-called \u201cCitizens United\u201d ruling. Citing free speech, the 5-4 majority eased longstanding restrictions on \u201cindependent spending\u201d by corporations, labor unions, and certain non-profit advocacy groups in political campaigns. The Citizens United ruling helped open the floodgates to massive corporate spending in the 2012 elections, and some fear the high court may be on a steady path to eventually gut all campaign regulation, in the name of free speech. 4. Clearing the air Hot-button issues like abortion, gay marriage, and healthcare reform may get all the headlines, but ask both liberal and conservative court watchers what area of the law the Roberts Court has had the greatest impact, and they will tell you it\u2019s business regulation. From limiting lawsuits against the employers, to loosening government oversight, the conservative bench has been forging a not-so quiet revolution. The court on Tuesday accepted review of an important environmental case over regulating greenhouse gases form \u201cstationary\u201d sources like power plants. It\u2019s the second case over carbon emission standards that will be decided this term. These petitions pit the Obama administration and its environmental allies against a range of business and \u201climited government\u201d interests. 5. Ginsburg going? If one group of federal employees can be considered \u201cessential\u201d and beyond any furlough, it\u2019s the federal judges themselves. If you don\u2019t believe so, it\u2019s in the Constitution. Article III gives judges life tenure and guaranteed salary. So long as they maintain \u201cgood behavior,\u201d they cannot be removed from office That means they get paid despite any shutdown, and can continue their regular duties. But as determined as some justices may want to stay on the job \u2013 now and for years to come \u2013 politics and age may conspire against them. Take Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 80 the oldest of the nine-member court. Her past health issues \u2013 she\u2019s a two-time cancer survivor \u2013 have led many fellow progressives to not-so gently insist she retire. Now. They want  President Barack Obama to get another crack at filling the high court, ensuring a liberal legacy will continue for perhaps decades. They cite the influence Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 both in their 50s \u2013 have had, inside the court and with the public at large. A Republican president elected in 2016 could upset that legacy, and move the court further to the right with future appointments. But Ginsburg has pushed back, suggesting she is in no hurry to go. The senior associate justice gave several candid press interviews over the summer\u2013 unusual for a justice not promoting a book\u2013 to suggest she may stay on for a few more years. The justice told CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin she would stay on this term, and perhaps the next, at least. To the New York Times she was more coy: \u201cThere will be a president after this one, and I\u2019m hopeful that that president will be a fine president.\u201d Test your knowledge of the Supreme Court",

            "article_content": "Values Voter Summit: ground zero for the no-compromise wing of the Republican Party Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council talks on conservatives and Congress The anti-Obamacare crowd will give Ted Cruz \"a rock star reception,\" Perkins says As trench warfare over the government shutdown drags into its 11th day, a number of Republicans with visible roles in the stalemate, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, will take a breather from Capitol Hill on Friday to speak at the Values Voter Summit, one of the conservative movement\u2019s marquee annual events. Pretty much everyone in official Washington has taken a beating in public opinion polls during the shutdown mess. Republicans, however, continue to shoulder most of the blame. But don\u2019t expect to hear calls for GOP compromise from the hundreds of activists, elected officials and conservative celebrities at Friday\u2019s kickoff to this weekend\u2019s summit, said Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, the event\u2019s sponsor. Cruz: I\u2019m for health care reform, just not Obamacare Instead, he said, expect this year\u2019s Values Voter Summit to be ground zero for the no-compromise wing of the Republican Party, and a hive of anti-Obamacare fervor where polarizing leaders like Cruz will be welcomed as conquering heroes. Cruz: I do support health care overhaul Photos: Texas junior Senator Ted Cruz Ted Cruz: Hurting the GOP brand? Perkins spoke to CNN about his annual conference and the state of the conservative movement as it goes toe-to-toe with the Republican establishment and a White House that shows few signs of backing down. Here is his interview, condensed and lightly edited. Q: What message do you expect the congressional leaders speaking at the summit to have about the shutdown, and any potential deals to reopen the government or raise the debt ceiling? Perkins: If you look at most of those we have coming to speak here, they\u2019re conservative leaders who have been pushing this effort to delay or suspend Obamacare. I don\u2019t think you are going to see them saying, \u2018Hey, we are going to settle here,\u2019 except for maybe Paul Ryan. I think they are going to use this as a platform to push for something of significance to come out of this showdown that has occurred between Republicans and the president. Sources: Key moment came between Ryan and Obama Q: Who wields more power in the GOP these days: Republican leadership in Congress, or the outside groups and conservative members who have tried so aggressively to dismantle Obamacare? Perkins: I don\u2019t know why people are surprised by this. Just go back and look at what happened. In 2006 and 2008, Rahm Emanuel was very successful in knocking off moderate Republicans as he headed up the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. And then the president forced them to walk the plank on Obamacare, and they got hammered in the 2010 election by conservatives. All of a sudden we saw this ideological shift. People running against Obamacare got elected in 2010. And that continued into 2012. Cruz: Debt ceiling is the best leverage Sen. Ted Cruz: GOP's odd man out S.E. Cupp: Ted Cruz is a hero DNC targeting key Republicans over shutdown So now you\u2019ve got this strong contingent of social, fiscal and foreign policy-related conservatives in the House who are simply doing what they campaigned on. They campaigned on repealing Obamacare, and that is what they are doing. And people are surprised by it. I know it\u2019s amazing that politicians do what they campaigned on, but that\u2019s what these guys are doing, and people can\u2019t figure it out. Q: So what\u2019s your reaction to the swift rise of Ted Cruz? Perkins: He has become a de facto leader of the Republican Party. He is what people are looking for. Somebody who will stand up and say, \u2018This is what I stand for, this is what I believe.\u2019 I would venture to say that he is going to get a rock star reception here. What he is doing is he is filling vacuum. And Mike Lee as well. There has been a complete breakdown between the formal GOP leadership and the outside conservative groups. There is even a breakdown between the GOP leadership and the conservatives on the inside. So you have Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Jim Jordan, Steve Scalise and others who are filling that void. S.E. Cupp: In Cruz vs. Ryan, Ryan is the winner Q: What\u2019s your take on John Boehner\u2019s leadership, as House Speaker, during this process? Perkins: I think he pulled it out of the fire by listening to his membership on this. I think his speakership was really in trouble, because he continued to go a direction that the membership did not want to go. These guys are simply doing what they said they were going to do once they were elected. I think he has a very difficult path to go. Now, his inner circle is not necessarily reflective of the conservatives. So he is being pulled in the opposite direction of where his members in his conference want to go. Analysis: This is Obama-Cruz shutdown Rep. King: Ted Cruz is a fraud Podesta: Ted Cruz 'running the House' Q: But he\u2019s helped himself on the right? Perkins: There is no question he has. I talk to members, the conservatives, daily. And I have heard very good remarks in terms of how he has handled this, both publicly and privately. Now, that could all change if we see a capitulation here at the end. Cruz: Use debt ceiling debate for leverage Q: Where do you stand on these primary challengers to veteran GOP senators like Mitch McConnell, Lamar Alexander, Pat Roberts, Lindsey Graham? Would you prefer to see the old guard lose in 2014? Perkins: I think it\u2019s good for the process. The Republican establishment has lost touch with where conservatives are. It\u2019s a challenge. The GOP has become a big tent in some respects. You\u2019ve got some libertarian-minded people in there. You\u2019ve got social conservatives. You\u2019ve got fiscal conservatives. There is a pretty big overlap between those two in many cases. The tea party has changed a lot of the dynamics for the Republican Party. You have probably 80%, 75% of the tea party are also social conservatives. But they are organized in ways that they haven\u2019t been in a long time. And that\u2019s hard for the establishment to handle. Q: You mentioned Paul Ryan earlier, who floated a solution to the shutdown fight that did not include Obamacare as a bargaining chip. He took some heat for that. How is perceived right now in the conservative movement? Perkins: He still has high standing. We\u2019ll see. He\u2019s not out of the mix. Look, it\u2019s a challenge when you hold a formal leadership position, especially in the House, where you do have a growing contingent of conservatives, but you\u2019ve also got the establishment-type Republicans who are in more of the leadership positions and have been around longer, and you are trying to balance all of them. Paul Ryan, being a player, having a seat at the table, it is a process of give and take. He has been given some element of grace from that standpoint. Ryan steps in at key moment Q: If you go to any conservative event and ask grass-roots activists about Chris Christie, you get the same reaction: He\u2019s a liberal, he pals around with Obama. But is that fair? Isn\u2019t he just as conservative on abortion and same-sex marriage, for example, as other prominent Republican leaders? Perkins: Well, he is not in the Rudy Giuliani school of social politics. But he was certainly to the left of where Mitt Romney was, I think, on some issues. His stated positions. There are some perception things, and then some policy things. We have had a few policy issues with him in the past. The perception is the way he publicly positioned himself right before the election with Obama. That incident remains very prominent in people\u2019s minds. Q: Did you invite him to the summit? Perkins: No. We invite conservatives that we work with. Q: So you don\u2019t view him as a conservative? Perkins: Well, when we get around to the presidential, if he is considered a contender at that point, we will issue invitations to everybody. We\u2019ve had Rudy Giuliani, we\u2019ve had John McCain. But that\u2019s not where we are focused this year. We want to give room for giving platform to the conservatives that we work with in Congress. Is shutdown a sorry spectacle or shock treatment? Q: So would you say the beating heart of the conservative movement right now is in Congress? Perkins: No, I would disagree. The strength of the conservative movement is in the states. We are not on defense on the state level. We are on the offense. We passed, in the last three years, 200 pieces of pro-life legislation. We are strengthening marriage. We are doing some good things in the red states across the country. So that\u2019s exciting. I am a little biased because I was state legislator, and I am more inclined toward the states. I have worked with governors. (Louisiana Gov.) Bobby Jindal is a friend of mine. And I have been a legislator. Legislators don\u2019t have to do a whole lot, except they talk a lot. They do shape policy. But you can walk away from that. Gingrich: The startling CNN poll It\u2019s the governors, it\u2019s the executives who actually have to implement things and make things happen and take care of real needs and infrastructure. It\u2019s hands-on. I think a proving ground for leaders. I think we would be a lot better off right now in America if we had a former governor in the White House instead of a senator. This is nothing against my friends here in Washington, but I will have to look hard when I\u2019ve got a good conservative governor running for president, because their executive skills have been proven. Q: The Family Research Council went up with a Christian radio ad in Virginia this week on behalf of Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican gubernatorial candidate. Democrats have relentlessly attacked him as a right wing social crusader, and it appears to be hurting him in the polls among women. Is it politically dangerous today to be a staunch cultural conservative running for office in a swing state? Only if you are unwilling to talk about those issues. If you are willing to stand on your record, the fact that you have passed laws that have protected women against unscrupulous abortionists, then yeah, absolutely you can run on it. If you are not going to run on them and talk about them and just let liberals define you on those issues, then you should not. Zelizer: D.C. crisis could jump-start case for reform Q: So you don\u2019t think Cuccinelli is talking enough about cultural issues? Perkins: No, I don\u2019t. He has got a great record. He has defended women against criminal behavior of abortionists. He supported and defended the clinic regulation act, which is the kind of stuff that keeps the Kermit Gosnells of the world in check. There is nothing to be apologetic for about that. Q: Who makes you more anxious, President Obama or Hillary Clinton? Perkins: President Obama. In the wake of Obama, the prospect of a Hillary presidency would be very concerning. If we were able to turn the clock back, I actually think we would have seen a more moderate government \u2013 certainly not to my liking, but much more moderate than what Barack Obama has done. But he has moved the line so much that I think that even a Hillary presidency would be radically to the left of center. Just because he has moved the bar.",

            "article_content": "Outlined below are some key cases the Supreme Court is scheduled to tackle in its 2013-14 term, which starts Monday. Forty-eight appeals are currently on the docket. As many as three dozen more are expected to be added in coming months. The caseload for the term is usually settled by February, with the term effectively ending in late June. Other important appeals that may yet be added cover such issues as gun rights, abortion regulation, cell phone privacy, as well as further litigation over President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law. Cases on the court\u2019s docket AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Photos: Today's Supreme Court Did Supreme Court make history or not? The politics of the high court's ruling Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action At issue: Whether a state violates the Equal Protection Clause by amending its constitution to prohibit race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public-university admission decisions. The case: Michigan\u2019s Proposition 2 was approved by voters seven years ago with 58 percent support. A federal appeals court later tossed the initiative, concluding it \u201cdistorts the political process and imposes a burden based on race that violates\u201d the federal Constitution. The arguments: The high court this past term considered a similar case from the University of Texas, which in some ways present mirror issues. A white student said a college\u2019s existing affirmative action policy violated her \u201cequal protection\u201d rights, while civil rights supporters of such programs claim Michigan\u2019s ban also has the same effect. The high court in the Texas petition made it harder to use affirmative action in the future, while not totally eliminating its use. The impact: The court\u2019s most closely watched current case this term, it raises a new thorny, unresolved questions over race and remedies. Justice Kagan will not hear this case, leaving the possibility of a 4-4 high court tie and no important precedent being established. CAMPAIGN DONATIONS McCutcheon v. FEC At issue: Constitutionality of a two-year ceiling on individual campaign donations to federal candidates and political committees. The case: The appeal comes from Alabama businessman and donor Shaun McCutcheon, supported in court by the Republican National Committee. The arguments: They object to a 1970s-era law restricting someone from giving no more than $48,600 to federal candidates, and $74,600 to political action committees, during a two-year election cycle. McCutcheon says he has a constitutional right to donate over that amount to as many candidates as he wants, so long as no one candidate gets more than the current $2600 limit. But the law\u2019s supporters worry millions of dollars could easily be funneled by a single well-heeled donor to his or her party and candidates of choice, reviving a system of \u201clegalized bribery.\u201d Supreme Court strikes down part of DOMA Summer Stories Wrap: U.S. Supreme Court The impact: A ruling by spring could have immediate impact on the mid-term elections, and further erode congressional efforts to regulate aggregate federal campaign money limits. Money and politics Supreme Court\u2019s first big case CHURCH & STATE Town of Greece, New York, v. Galloway At issue: Public prayer in town meetings. The case: The Town Board of this Rochester suburb had long opened its monthly public sessions with individual prayers. The policy was challenged because virtually all of those invited to offer prayers were Christians, so the board for a time asked a few others\u2013 including a Wiccan, Baha\u2019i leader, and Jewish lay person\u2013 to offer invocations. But local citizens Susan Galloway and Linda Stephens nevertheless sued. The arguments: A federal appeals court found the practice an unconstitutional mix of church and state, and that local officials were not diligent enough seeking more diverse voices from other faiths. But local officials call it highly inclusive, and say civic prayers have long been permitted nationwide. The impact: Few issues draw as much controversy as those approaching the intersection of faith and the public arena. The Supreme Court has taken a case-by-case approach to Establishment Clause appeals, but generally upholds the discretion of government bodies to acknowledge America\u2019s religious heritage\u2013 whether in Christmas displays, Ten Commandment monuments, or legislative prayers. EXECUTIVE POWER NLRB v. Noel Canning At issue: The validity of President Obama\u2019s recess appointments to a federal agency. The case: A U.S. appeals panel concluded three people named to the NLRB lacked authority, because the presidential appointments were made while the Senate was technically in a \u201cpro forma\u201d session during the winter holiday break. That Board had ruled on a Washington state labor dispute, but the canning company filing suit claims the panel\u2019s members did not have a proper quorum. The arguments: Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the past have used the \u201cvirtual Congress\u201d tactic to block unilateral appointments by the president when the Senate is away. But GOP leaders here claimed the Obama appointments to the board created a panel that was overly pro-union, and an eventual high court ruling could invalidate hundreds of findings issued over the past two years. The impact:  The case sets up a high-stakes Supreme Court fight between the other two branches of government. What the justices decide could also put in jeopardy the recess appointment of Richard Cordray, who heads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a move also being challenged in a separate lawsuit. Cases that might be added HEALTH CARE REFORM Liberty University v. Lew; Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.; Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius. At issue: A provision in the new healthcare reform law requiring companies and institutions of a certain size to provide insurance coverage for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay. Can private employers refuse on the claim it violates their religious freedoms? The case: Appeals by a Christian university in Virginia, an Oklahoma-based retail chain, and a Mennonite family-owned for-profit company. The petitions also make larger arguments in opposing other provisions of the Affordable Care Act, championed by President Obama. These are among more than six dozen separate legal challenges to nearly every aspect of the healthcare law, including the \u201cemployer mandate\u201d to provide a minimum level of health insurance for their workers, or pay a federal penalty. The arguments: The high court in 2012 narrowly upheld the law\u2019s key funding section\u2013 the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance or face a financial penalty. That ruling allowed other parts of the law to go into effect, but also allowed those pending lawsuits over its application to proceed. The impact: These cases are coming to high court attention as conservative lawmakers in Congress seek to eliminate or severely eviscerate the ACA. GUN RIGHTS National Rifle Association v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives At issue: Appeal of a federal law banning sales of handguns to minors by licensed firearms dealers. The case: Two 19-year-old individuals are part of the original lawsuit brought. A federal appeals court in New Orleans had upheld the law, saying \u201cCongress designed its scheme to solve a particular problem: violent crime associated with the trafficking of handguns from federal firearms licensees to young adult.\u201d The ruling does not apply to licensed sales of long rifles, or private handgun sales or gifts to minors. The arguments: The NRA says those age 18-20 are unfairly being singled out, while the court said Congress took a \u201ccalibrated, compromise\u201d approach. The impact: This could be one of the biggest Second Amendment legal challenges since the high court upheld an individual right to possess handgun for self-protection. It would further test the acceptable constitutional limits of state and national governments to pass \u201csensible\u201d gun control legislation. ABORTION RIGHTS Cline v. Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice State discretion to limit or ban abortions performed with medicine, instead of surgery. The case: An Oklahoma state law regulates the ability of doctors to prescribe a medication regime (the so-called RU-486 pills) to terminate early pregnancies. The law makes it a crime to deviate from the FDA-approved dosage and time limits of the drugs. But many physicians\u2013 backed by abortion rights supporters\u2013 say they routinely induce medical abortions through a combination of drugs they safer is simpler, safer, and less expensive. The arguments: The high court has formally added this case to its docket, but put things on hold while it seeks procedural answers from lower state courts. This petition is the first of several restrictive abortion laws nationwide to get review by the justices. The impact: The justices have already agreed to review a separate appeal: a free-speech challenge by anti-abortion protesters to a Massachusetts law permitting buffer or exclusion zones around facilities that perform abortions. PRIVACY U.S. v. Wurie and Riley v. California AT ISSUE: Separate appeals over whether police must obtain a warrant to search data on the cellphone of a person under arrest. The cases: Criminal suspects in Massachusetts and California were convicted, in part after phone numbers, text messages, and addresses obtained from personal electronic devices linked them to criminal drug and gang activity. The arguments: The Supreme Court has issued mixed privacy rulings in the past two years: allowing criminal suspects to be DNA-tested upon arrest yet before conviction, to help solve \u201ccold\u201d cases; but saying in most cases, search warrants are needed before GPS electronic surveillance of vehicles, or blood tests for suspected drunk drivers. The impact: Chief Justice John Roberts recently said his court\u2019s biggest challenge in coming years will be to articulate what constitutional protections \u201capply to new issues and new technology.\u201d Also: In Re Electronic Privacy Information Center (13-58) - A direct challenge to the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance of domestic telephone communication records. A privacy rights group claims a secret federal court improperly authorized the government to collect the electronic records. The court for a variety of procedural and substantive reasons is unlikely to accept the case at this time, perhaps waiting for it to percolate in the lower courts. SAME-SEX DISCRIMINATION Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock At issue: Whether private businesses can refuse\u2013 on personal religious grounds\u2013 to offer services typically available to the general public. The case: The owners of a small Albuquerque photography studio refused to film a 2006 commitment ceremony involving a lesbian couple, saying it went against their Christian beliefs of \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d between one man and one woman. The state supreme court concluded that violated New Mexico\u2019s Human Rights Act. The arguments: Competing debate over religious freedom versus \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d discrimination of homosexuals. Although some of New Mexico\u2019s counties have recently issued marriage licenses for same-sex couples, the state as a whole neither allows, nor bans it. The impact: This could be the latest constitutional test of gay rights, after the Supreme Court in June struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied a range of federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. The legal debate now shifts back to state laws.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Wendy Davis has officially announced her candidacy for governor of Texas She hasn't lost an election since 1999 but faces an uphill battle in the GOP-dominated state Though his war chest is full, her Republican opponent is short on name recognition Obama campaign operatives bring well-honed experience to race Correction: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated that Wendy Davis had not lost an election prior to 1999. Wendy Davis went public Thursday with some news that everyone in politics already knew: She\u2019s officially running for governor of Texas. The state senator from Fort Worth electrified Democrats in June by slipping on a pair of pink Mizunos and a back brace to stage a dramatic 11-hour filibuster of a Republican bill that drastically scaled back abortion rights in the state. Never mind that the bill eventually passed in a special legislative session: Democrats across the country were in full swoon mode. In an e-mail officially announcing her candidacy, she said, \u201cAs Texans, we believe that with hard work, determination, and a little old-fashioned common sense, we can build a better future for ourselves and our families. \u201cWe can make our communities safer, create jobs, and get Texas moving in the right direction.\u201d Davis, a single mom who worked her way up from a trailer park to make it through Harvard Law School, danced around the question of running for governor all summer but is now ready to make it official. For the beleaguered Democrats of Texas, she represents the best shot at capturing the governor\u2019s mansion since George W. Bush ousted Ann Richards in 1994. But the excitement swirling around her candidacy will quickly give way to a grim reality: Texas is still deep red and socially conservative, dangerous turf for a Democrat best known for standing up for abortion rights. In 2012, Mitt Romney drubbed President Barack Obama by 16 points there. Smart political types in Washington and Austin have already come to the same conclusion: Davis can\u2019t win. They\u2019re probably right. Time and again, ambitious Democrats have been tempted by the forbidden fruit of Texas politics \u2013 a seemingly favorable demographic upheaval, driven by thriving urban centers and a booming Hispanic population \u2013 only to come up woefully short. The task becomes even more challenging in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout tends to fall off and the white share of the vote spikes, favoring Republicans. The likely GOP nominee, state Attorney General Greg Abbott, has a substantial war chest, powerful allies and a compelling life story. He became a paraplegic in 1984 when a tree fell on him after a storm, crushing his spine. Texas abortion bill fails amid chaos Perry: Filibuster senator was a teen mom But in the spirit of contrarianism, here are eight glimmers of hope for Davis as she tries to pull off what would undoubtedly be one of the biggest upsets of the 2014 cycle. Wendy Davis: It\u2019s the real Texans who count 1. She knows how to win Winning a state Senate campaign is a far cry from winning a statewide election, especially for a polarizing Democrat in GOP-leaning Texas, but Davis survived two brutal campaigns in a Fort Worth-area district that, in many ways, is a microcosm of the state. The area\u2019s Hispanic population surged over the past decade, and nonwhite voters now make up a majority of Davis\u2019s district, particularly in Fort Worth\u2019s heavily Hispanic north side. In 2008, when she first ran for the seat, and in her tough 2012 re-election fight, Davis outworked her opponents in Tarrant County and assembled a coalition of Hispanics, African-Americans, female voters and moderate Republicans to win. Both races were squeakers: She won by less than 3 points each time. Davis isn\u2019t afraid to throw a punch, either. In 2008, her campaign nuked the Republican incumbent, Kim Brimer, with negative television ads portraying him as a crooked Austin insider (her supporters snarkily called him \u201cKim Shady\u201d). Four years later, Gov. Rick Perry and an armada of Republicans pumped time and energy into the race to unseat Davis, but she still beat back her GOP challenger \u2013 even in a district that Obama lost badly. Davis was first elected to the Fort Worth City Council in 1999 and has not lost a race since. Abbott, who served on the Texas Supreme Court before becoming the state\u2019s attorney general in 2002, has not faced a credible opponent, Republican or Democrat, in years. Wendy Davis weighs in about her future \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic about Wendy\u2019s for upsetting Greg Abbott,\u201d said Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, another bright light on Texas\u2019s fresh-faced roster of Democrats. \u201cShe is a very talented candidate and incredibly hard working. Greg Abbott represents what has become a very extreme wing of the Republican Party. And more independent and moderate Republicans in Texas have had enough of tea party Republicans.\u201d 2. Greg who? In his three re-election bids, Perry laid waste to a trio of Democratic challengers \u2013 Tony Sanchez, Chris Bell and Bill White \u2013 who dared to run statewide with a scarlet D next to their name. Perry\u2019s political talents aside, he benefited from the power of incumbency and name recognition. Despite having more than $20 million in the bank, Abbott lacks Perry\u2019s star power. According to a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll released in June, more than half of voters had no opinion of Abbott, including 46% of Republicans. A Texas Lyceum poll out this week showed Abbott leading Davis 29% to 21% but showed that a majority of voters had no preference in the race and revealed that 45% of Republicans and almost 80% of independents didn\u2019t know enough about Abbott. Despite her buzz in political circles, Davis is similarly unknown to most voters. But unlike the Democratic gubernatorial candidates who preceded her, she\u2019s getting started on a roughly even playing field and has an opportunity to define her opponent early. 3. Campaigns matter Few things seem to send a thrill up the leg of polling wizards than writing off candidates before a race has even begun. \u201cWendy Davis Won\u2019t Win,\u201d blared the headline of a recent New Republic piece by Nate Cohn, the magazine\u2019s resident numbers-cruncher. Cohn\u2019s analysis was mostly accurate, but these high-and-mighty dismissals ignore one immutable fact of politics: Campaigns and candidates matter. Just ask Missouri\u2019s Claire McCaskill and Todd Akin. Texas offers a wonderful example. The state\u2019s last Democratic governor, Richards, began her campaign in 1990 in a 27-point hole against a well-funded Republican named Clayton Williams. But \u201cClaytie\u201d did himself in on the campaign trail with a series of damaging gaffes: He once refused to shake hands with Richards at a candidate\u2019s forum, and he made a rape joke that haunted him throughout the campaign. Meanwhile, Richards leveraged her natural charisma and appeal to suburban women to eke out a 3-point win that November. 4. The Texas Hispanic boom According to the 2010 census, the Hispanic population in Texas ballooned by almost 3 million during the previous decade, and it\u2019s safe to assume that number has only expanded since then. Much as it does nationally, this demographic trend in Texas works unmistakably in the favor of the Democrats, who have capitalized on the abrasive anti-immigrant rhetoric emanating from conservative pockets of the Republican Party. In the 2010 governor\u2019s race, for example, Democrat Bill White won Hispanic voters, who made up about 17% of the vote that year, by a nearly 2-1 margin (the flip side of the math here is that White\u2019s opponent, Perry, swamped him overall by racking up a huge margins among \u201cAnglos,\u201d as they say in Texas). But Davis can\u2019t take Hispanic voters for granted, argued Texas GOP Chairman Steve Munisteri, who said he has five full-time staffers assigned to outreach efforts in Spanish-speaking communities. Munisteri said Texas Republicans understand the pressing need to expand the party\u2019s appeal beyond white voters, noting that the Texas GOP endorsed a guest-worker program into their 2012 party platform, even as conservative activists opposed the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s not just policy and whether there is action or inaction,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also whether the Republican Party is viewed as welcoming to Hispanic citizens or hostile to Hispanic citizens. We have to come across as sincere that we really want to include Hispanics in the party.\u201d 5. The Obama SWAT team After re-electing the president last year, a handful of field marshals from the Obama campaign turned their eyes to Texas, with its exploding and under-registered Hispanic population, in hopes of growing the electorate and one day moving the state\u2019s cache of 38 electoral votes into the Democratic column and forever road-blocking Republican hopes of capturing the White House. They dubbed their new group \u201cBattleground Texas.\u201d The group\u2019s organizers have been clear-eyed and honest with reporters about the challenging and long-term nature of the project. Few expect Battleground Texas organizers to register enough Hispanic, African-American and other first-time voters to overcome entrenched GOP advantages in such a narrow time frame. Even so, Davis will have on her side the brains and muscle behind the most sophisticated voter turnout operation in American political history. That\u2019s an unequivocal asset. Critics have questioned how effective Battleground Texas can be without Obama, a uniquely talented and charismatic figure, at the top of the ticket rallying voters. But this is Texas, where Obama is about as popular as the Oklahoma Sooners. Pragmatic Democrats are just fine keeping a safe distance from the president, even though Abbott and his team will do their best to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. 6. A potential spoiler Debra Medina, a Wharton businesswoman and conservative activist, captured nearly 20% of the vote in the 2010 Republican gubernatorial primary by making a strong play for the nascent tea party movement. She\u2019s currently raising money for a possible 2014 comptroller campaign but also leaving the door open to an independent run for governor next year, in part because of her not-so-subtle disdain for a long line of establishment-backed GOP figures in her state \u2013 Perry and Abbott chief among them. \u201cYou look at our ticket, and it\u2019s all rich white guys,\u201d Medina said. \u201cThere are few women and liberty-leaning candidates on the ballot. If we go through the nomination process and end up with a whole bunch of Mitt Romneys on the ticket next November, people aren\u2019t going to get excited about it.\u201d Medina said she plans to make a decision about an independent bid for governor by early December, after she decides whether to file as a candidate for comptroller. If she does run for the top office, Medina\u2019s support would almost certainly draw from the tea party activist wing of the Republican coalition. That would be bad news for Abbott. 7. Suburban women Davis is most famous for her filibuster of Senate Bill 5, which curtailed access to abortion in Texas after it passed this summer in a special legislative session. The fight made her an archvillain in the eyes of many conservatives and anti-abortion activists, but it transformed her into a folk hero among left-leaning women\u2019s groups, who believe Davis can use the issues of women\u2019s health care to drive a wedge between Republicans and female voters. Texas abortion law challenged in Plan Parenthood lawsuit She has an opening, according to Jim Henson, the director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, and Joshua Blank, the project\u2019s pollster. As the pair recently wrote in the Texas Tribune, suburban women have been trending away from the GOP in recent years. In late 2010, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll found that 50% of suburban women identified as Republicans. Two years later, 43% called themselves Republicans. And in their most recent survey, in June of this year, the number had dropped to 38%.  Over the same three-year span, the number of suburban women calling themselves Democrats jumped from 37% for 46%. In other words, women in Texas are increasingly kosher with voting for the blue team. Davis will need their help to break the Republican chokehold on white voters. In conservative states, abortion pushback with an eye toward Roe 8. Outside money The filibuster that was so popular online in June and made Davis an instant Democratic celebrity had the added benefit of growing her list of supporters: an e-mail network that\u2019s about to double as a national donor base. But Davis will also have reinforcements. While Battleground Texas works the ground game, the women\u2019s groups who worked hard to recruit Davis into the race \u2013 Planned Parenthood, EMILY\u2019s List and Texas-based Annie\u2019s List \u2013 are expected to provide air cover, pumping money into Texas this year and next to fund radio, television and mail ads. Even if Davis comes up short, the opportunity to help inch Texas toward Democratic hands in the makes it an appealing target for donors and outside groups, said one well-connected Austin Democrat who is close to the soon-to-be-launched campaign. \u201cThere will be a confluence of excited and effective organizations that could have important roles to play inside and out of the campaign structure,\u201d said the Democrat, who declined to be named because the campaign was not official. \u201cAnnie\u2019s List, the Texas Democratic Party, labor unions are all gearing up and appear to be working together effectively. And individual/institutional donors from across the nation saw Wendy\u2019s filibuster and have made it clear they are interested. After all, there is a long-play beyond just 2014 that is very compelling. \u201cThe more you invest in the state, the more you accelerate demographic change in voter turnout and the quicker you put Texas in play in the electoral college map and change the politics of the nation.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans look to retain governorship in battleground state Race between Terry McAuliffe and Ken Cuccinelli is viewed by some as \"lesser of two evils\" Enter Robert Sarvis, a Libertarian candidate who has quietly crept up in the polls He says \"the system is rotten\" due to Republican and Democratic \"malfeasance\" The Virginia governor\u2019s race has often been looked to as an off-year barometer of national political sentiment. This year\u2019s grind-it-out race, an acrimonious spitball contest between two candidates only slightly more likeable than Walter White, is anything but. In a lesser-of-two-evils campaign, Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Democratic fundraiser and confidante to former President Bill Clinton, is clinging to a modest but sturdy lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli, the state\u2019s attorney general. Republicans have pilloried McAuliffe as a sleazy political operator and failed businessman who exploited his Washington connections to help his sputtering car company, GreenTech Automotive. Cuccinelli has been targeted as a far-right social crusader who would curb abortion rights and access to contraception. Democrats on Twitter are fond of calling him #creepyken. McAuliffe is leading Cuccinelli among likely voters by an eight-point margin, 47% to 39%, according to a Washington Post poll out this week. McAuliffe is hardly bulletproof: A federal investigation into GreenTech has sullied his reputation, and only two-thirds of Democrats \u2013 his own party \u2013 consider him \u201chonest and trustworthy.\u201d Virginia's gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe under fire But Cuccinelli is on much shakier ground. While Republicans are slightly more fired up about voting for him than Democrats are for McAuliffe, Cuccinelli\u2019s favorable ratings are next-to-toxic: More than half of likely voters view him unfavorably. Enter Robert Sarvis. As public dismay with the two main candidates calcifies, the baby-faced 37-year old Libertarian candidate from Fairfax has quietly crept northward in the polls, reaching 10% in the Post poll. That\u2019s not nearly enough to win in November \u2013 with just five weeks until Election Day, even Sarvis admits \u201cwe have to get a lot higher\u201d \u2013 but he looks increasingly likely to play the role of spoiler by siphoning conservative votes away from Cuccinelli. Sarvis chafes at the label. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what it means to be a spoiler,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe system is rotten to the core from Republican and Democratic malfeasance. They have already spoiled the system. I don\u2019t even know what it means to be a spoiler. If I am the only one arguing for freedom and the rule of law, then those two are the spoilers as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Positioning himself as a moderate The Harvard and NYU-educated attorney and software programmer \u2013 he was part of a team that won Google\u2019s Android Developer Prize for creating a \u201cmobile app for true nightlifers\u201d \u2013 is positioning himself as the moderate choice between two \u201cextreme\u201d candidates. In his telling, McAuliffe \u201cstands for an extreme version of crony capitalism.\u201d  Cuccinelli is \u201cvery regressive on social issues\u201d and \u201cunreliable\u201d on economic matters. Both parties, he said, are in league with the banks and \u201crich folks\u201d \u2013 a frustration that first motivated him to run for office in 2011, when he mounted an unsuccessful Republican bid to unseat longtime Democratic state Senate leader Dick Saslaw. Though he said he left the GOP after that race, he voted in Virginia\u2019s Republican presidential primary in 2012, casting a ballot for Ron Paul. That November, he voted for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee. Sarvis supports same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization and says climate change is real. He opposes gun restrictions, higher taxes, the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and last year\u2019s landmark transportation bill in Richmond that raised some taxes to help fix northern Virginia\u2019s clogged roadways. Sarvis said he would pay for transportation funding, in part, by cutting from the education budget and finding ways to \u201cprioritize spending.\u201d Sarvis might deny being a spoiler, but Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign conceded Thursday that the Libertarian is draining support from the Republican nominee. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that a vote for Robert Sarvis is a vote for Terry McAuliffe and a vote against liberty,\u201d said Richard Cullen, Cuccinelli\u2019s communications director. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that there\u2019s no greater defender of first principles and liberty in Virginia than Ken Cuccinelli,\u201d Cullen said, outlining why Libertarian-leaning Republicans should stay in the party fold. \u201cKen was the first attorney general in the nation to sue to stop Obamacare and he led an eight year battle to secure Virginians\u2019 private property rights in the state constitution. He\u2019s also the only candidate in this race who\u2019s laid out a clear, substantive plan to free up the private sector and create 58,000 jobs.\u201d Challenges for third-party candidates Few political observers in Virginia expect Sarvis, who has little money in the bank and almost no political machinery behind him, to reach the 10% threshold, or even the 8% mark he hit in another recent poll from NBC News and Marist. The last third-party candidate in Virginia to reach that level of support was Marshall Coleman, who snagged 11% of the vote in the madcap three-way 1994 Senate race. Unlike Sarvis, though, Coleman had political pedigree and bona fide institutional support: then-Sen. John Warner backed Coleman that year over the flame-throwing Republican nominee, Oliver North. The Democratic incumbent, Chuck Robb, eked out a three-point win that year. A more recent example of third-party noise-making came in the 2005 governor\u2019s race, when Russ Potts, a GOP state senator who ran as an independent, aired a memorable statewide television ad featuring people loudly banging on pots as they chanted \u201cWe want Potts!\u201d Despite polling as high as 9% that year, Potts only garnered 2% in the end, as Democrat Tim Kaine edged out Republican Jerry Kilgore to win the governorship. Even if Sarvis tumbles from his current standing and only captures a small slice of the vote on Election Day, Republicans fear that most of that support will come straight out of Cuccinelli\u2019s back pocket, especially in what\u2019s expected to be a low turnout election. \u201cNearly all of his vote will come from people right of center who feel obligated to vote but can\u2019t support Cuccinelli because he is too far to the right, or they fear what he would be like as governor and can\u2019t vote for McAuliffe because he\u2019s a Democrat,\u201d observed one well-connected Richmond Republican who is not directly involved in the race. Cuccinelli faces gender gap Cuccinelli is in trouble with or without a third party candidate, due in large part to a startling gender gap that emerged this summer after free-spending Democrats began hammering the Republican on women\u2019s health issues. Women favor McAuliffe over Cuccinelli by an enormous 24-point margin, and even without Sarvis in the race, the Post poll showed McAuliffe leading Cuccinelli by a five-point margin, 49-44. But Sarvis isn\u2019t going anywhere, and his rising poll numbers are making an uphill fight for Cuccinelli that much steeper. Sarvis\u2019 most obvious challenge is exposure. A large majority of Virginia voters still have no clue who he is or what he stands for, a challenge that wasn\u2019t made easier by his exclusion from a debate Wednesday night sponsored by the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. In response, Sarvis tapped into his meager campaign budget \u2013 he reported having only $19,109 in the bank at the end of August \u2013 to run a TV ad during the debate attacking McAuliffe\u2019s \u201ccronyism\u201d and Cuccinelli\u2019s \u201cnarrow-minded social agenda.\u201d The ad starred his two children and his African-American wife, Astrid, whom he met in a Mississippi book store when he spied her reading \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d and told her he had recently seen the movie. John Vaught LaBeaume, a Sarvis adviser, said the campaign has been in touch with the organizers of the third and final debate in Roanoke in late October, and have received \u201cencouraging\u201d signals about being included. Until then, Sarvis said he\u2019s content to meet voters by driving around the commonwealth in his van, listening to Pink Floyd, as the other campaigns savage each other on the airwaves. \u201cIf they keep destroying each other with negative ads that\u2019s fine with us,\u201d he said drily.",

            "article_content": "Running a state and running for president at the same time presents huge challenges. Will he do it? While his party has tacked hard to the right, Christie seems to most a centrist by comparison Analyst says that the positions that give Christie crossover appeal will hurt him in the primaries Christie's strong personality and bluntness could also be detrimental in scripted presidential politics Charging out of last week\u2019s Republican National Committee meeting in Boston, Chris Christie\u2019s message was clear: The party needs to ditch fights over ideology and get back to winning elections. \u201cI am in this to win,\u201d the New Jersey governor told establishment Republicans. \u201cI am going to do anything I need to do to win.\u201d Christie raps potential 2016 rivals at Republican confab Christie aims to do just that in his home state, where he\u2019s expected to be easily re-elected in November. But others see his winning attitude, popularity, and personal forcefulness as qualities that make him a possible favorite for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Christie says he\u2019s focused on his current job and plans to keep it. Growing outside expectations for a national candidacy bring positive attention that can amplify his message and agenda for the state. Could Christie's decision hurt in 2016? Chris Christie's political ambitions Dad's plea: 'Don't let my daughter die!' Christie points to 2016 in RNC speech Does the GOP need more navel-gazing? Ron Paul: Chris Christie offers nothing But the leading edge of presidential politics \u2013 welcomed by him or not \u2013 also comes with new scrutiny and pressures that will test his ability to govern effectively if he is in fact positioning himself for a run \u2013 and a win. \u201cThe politics \u2013 he got three big audiences he\u2019s got to be worried about: New Jersey, where you have a moderate to left-leaning audience. Soon, he\u2019s going to be worried about Republican caucus-goers (in Iowa). Going to be much more conservative. And then at the end, he\u2019s going to be worried about those swing voters,\u201d said Jennifer Millerwise Dyck, a Republican strategist and former George W. Bush campaign spokeswoman. As governor, Christie finds himself in a far different position than other potential 2016 contenders. Those in Congress flirting with presidential ambitions can posture, propose bills that go nowhere, and largely avoid accountability for a period of time, if they choose. Those outside of government entertaining White House possibilities may have more room to position themselves; travel more freely to key states and otherwise test the waters without having to think twice about how a tweet, or a speech or a photo-op might play at home. Christie must run New Jersey. He must make decisions that effect nearly nine million people - execute policy, sign or reject bills, and be a visible booster for a state where the economy continues to recover slowly and still feels the effects of Superstorm Sandy last October that devastated parts of economically vital Jersey Shore. Though there is an upside that may favor winning. Beginning with Thomas Jefferson, 17 governors have run for president and won, and two of the last three Republican presidents \u2013 George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan \u2013 were governors before they entered the White House. Republican voters, too, seem to prefer candidates with Christie\u2019s background. One April poll showed 59% of GOP voters said they would prefer a governor as their party\u2019s nominee, compared to 23% who opted for a senator. \u201cAs a candidate, it is probably helpful to be a governor,\u201d said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cYou are making decisions, you are exercising leadership, in a way that you can\u2019t do if you are one person in a legislative body.\u201d But the up and down nature of what Christie faces was clear over the past several days. There was his speech in Boston, a largely positive moment for him. Then it was back to business. In the span of a few days, Christie approved edible forms of marijuana to be available to qualified minors, vetoed a weapons ban and  decided to outlaw gay conversion therapy for minors in his state. Each decision was viewed through a presidential political lens and presented complex challenges that impacted the lives of people in his state. A centrist by comparison? When Christie forbid gay conversion therapy for minors, many conservatives took to Twitter to critique the decision. \u201cThe future Democrat president candidate?\u201d asked Tom Orr. \u201cIf Chris Christie gets the Republican bid for President I will not vote Republican,\u201d tweeted Brian Vazquez. For his part, Christie has been outspoken in favor of compromise and working with Democrats. \u201cWe can stick to our principles and still come together to compromise,\u201d Christie said on Monday. \u201cCompromise is not a dirty word.  It is the way this country was built. And we need to get things done for the people that elect us.\u201d But to many he is seen as a centrist in a party that has steadily swung away from the center. The same traits that make Christie popular in New Jersey and a potentially strong presidential candidate in a general election could keep him from winning anything beyond another four years in Trenton. \u201cCommon sense sells. He\u2019s great on that. He\u2019s a great national candidate. He will be great in a general election, if he makes it that far,\u201d said CNN \u201cCrossfire\u201d host and Republican analyst S.E. Cupp. \u201cThe problem will be he will have to get through a primary.\u201d CNN contributor and New York Times columnist Charles Blow agreed that Christie has some crossover appeal. But his appeal to moderates will hurt him with the hard right in his party. \u201cThis is the kind of Republican that you could get more moderates behind. Maybe you could shave off a few Democrats,\u201d Blow said. \u201cBut you cannot escape the Republican primary process and that process is much more conservative than Republicans in general, and definitely much more conservative than the American populace and electorate.\u201d Is Chris Christie really a centrist? But to get to a general election, Christie needs to capture the nomination, which has favored conservative positions. The Republican governor is anti-abortion \u2013 a decision he made years ago. At a 2011 anti-abortion rally at the New Jersey statehouse, Christie said that \u201cevery life is precious and a gift from God.\u201d Christie is also against same-sex marriage and lampooned the Supreme Court earlier this year for striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited federal benefits for same-sex spouses. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is a centrist,\u201d said Weingart, pointing out that many of his positions are conservative, despite that fact that both houses of the New Jersey legislature are controlled by Democrats. \u201cThat may or may not be tempering the decisions he would make if he had Republican majorities in both houses,\u201d Weingart concluded. Will his persona wear on voters? The list of ways you could use to describe Christie is long: brash, unvarnished, confrontational, loud, and the list goes on. He has been described as an \u201caverage joe,\u201d someone who speaks like many of the voters who will go to the ballot box and vote for him. That was clear when he Christie gave an answer about why he started the public argument with Paul. \u201cI was asked a question at a forum in Aspen and I gave an answer. I was asked a question at a forum in Aspen and I gave an answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ask me a question, I give an answer. That\u2019s what people expect from people in public life.\u201d Christie\u2019s directness, however, also comes with a downside. \u201cNew Jersey voters take it with a grain of salt,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll, said of Christie\u2019s forwardness. \u201cThat has certainly been attractive to voters outside New Jersey, but I am not sure it plays everywhere. If you go out to the Midwest, I think it has an appeal for a limited amount of time.\u201d Murray said the bigger problem for Christie is whether or not he can maintain that bluntness in face of the tightly controlled world of presidential politics where a unscripted remark can send the front-runner back into the pack. \u201cWe are now seeing decisions being made where running for president is at the front of his mind,\u201d Murray said, pointing to the vetoing the ban on guns and his decision on gay conversation therapy. \u201cThat, at some point, could undercut his image as being authentic.\u201d That issue is one that illustrates the challenge of governing a state and running nationally, and in the end, winning - or not.

            "article_content": "Virginia governor Bob McDonnell was considered a Republican rising star Gifts from businessman have raised questions about the once-invincible governor Current gubernatorial candidate also has ties to businessman Jonnie Williams Williams' gifts included picking up catering tab for daughter's wedding and $6,500 Rolex This southern city is a tranquil place in the summertime. The steamy downtown streets and grand boulevards that radiate outward from the old Confederate capital are less choked as families seek shelter from the heat and clear out of town for jaunts to the beach or the river. Children are off to summer camp or at the pool. Attention has turned to barbecues, outdoor concerts and the hotly anticipated arrival of the Washington Redskins\u2019 training camp. Even in election years, politics in Virginia is usually an autumn enterprise. Until this year. Even with the legislature out of session, Richmond has been consumed this summer by a slowly unfolding drama starring the once-invincible governor, Bob McDonnell, and a charismatic donor who provided the Republican and his family with almost $150,000 in previously undisclosed gifts, including a Rolex watch, a Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree, and a high-dollar payment to a company owned by the governor. State and federal investigators are now looking into McDonnell\u2019s relationship with Jonnie Williams, the CEO of a troubled nutritional supplement company called Star Scientific who was recently dubbed \u201cUncle Jonnie\u201d by longtime Richmond Times-Dispatch columnist Jeff Schapiro for his apparent willingness to shower the McDonnell clan with fancy gifts. Poll: McDonnell\u2019s numbers fall as scandal unfolds Virginia's McDonnell giving it all back McDonnell: GOP soul-searching 'healthy' McDonnell: GOP 'has work to do' New strategy for the GOP The inquiries into McDonnell and Star Scientific have also threatened to ensnare this year\u2019s Republican nominee for governor, Ken Cuccinelli, who has his own ties to Williams but has recently sought to distance himself from both the donor and the embattled governor. The details of the investigation, revealed by leak after devastating leak in the pages of The Washington Post and other newspapers, have stunned both Republicans and Democrats, who are having trouble squaring the well-mannered politician they know with the careless and tacky figure portrayed in news reports. \u201cYou can disagree with the person on policy, and the disagreements can be passionate or even vehement, but you just didn\u2019t expect this from this governor,\u201d said state Sen. Donald McEachin, a Democrat from Richmond. \u201cHe has always come across in dealing with him, on a political level and personal level, as someone who is squeaky clean. Regrettably, it\u2019s appearing that that\u2019s not the case.\u201d McDonnell has been at the center of some hot-button partisan fights \u2013 notably a 2012 legislative battle over an invasive abortion procedure \u2013 but the biggest personal knock on McDonnell before this summer\u2019s scandal was the compulsive attention he paid to his diligently parted hair. McDonnell: Resignation rumors \u2018irresponsible\u2019 Since his election in 2009, Republicans have labeled McDonnell a star. His fundraising acumen, message discipline and understated charm helped lift him to the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association in 2011, a post other governors have used as a springboard to a presidential campaign. McDonnell\u2019s tightly knit team of advisers exercised great power over the machinery of Virginia Republican politics, appeasing the right wing of the party while also courting the business community that has long held sway in Richmond. The governor and his aides, many of whom were caught off guard by the Star Scientific imbroglio, also proved skillful at courting members of the national media. Impressive resume eclipsed by scandal Political watchers assumed in 2012 that McDonnell was considered for the position of GOP presidential Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate even though McDonnell was never vetted for the job, a person familiar with the vice presidential search process told CNN. Still, some Republicans figured McDonnell would at least take a look at running for president in 2016. Others pegged him for a future cabinet official, perhaps attorney general, in a Republican administration. Now, facing the appearance of impropriety, ethical wrongdoing and, according to The Post, a federal grand jury, those hopes appeared dashed. New allegations against McDonnell emerge But more troubling to McDonnell loyalists is that his impressive gubernatorial resume \u2013 the crowning achievement of a long political career \u2013 has been eclipsed by scandal. The governor marshaled a landmark bipartisan transportation deal through the legislature earlier this year, even though it included tax hikes that rankled conservatives in his own party. Virginia ended the most recent fiscal year with a $262 million budget surplus, ensuring pay raises for state employees for the first time since 2007. The state unemployment rate has dropped to 5.3%. At one point in 2011, McDonnell\u2019s approval rating was a sky-high 70%. Those numbers later came back to earth, but he has mostly hovered above a 50% approval rating throughout his tenure in Richmond. Today, with the Star Scientific saga a regular feature on Virginia news broadcasts thanks to the drip-drip nature of story, more Virginians disapprove of his performance than approve. McDonnell and allies have cautiously defended the lack of disclosure as consistent with Virginia law, which does not require elected officials to report gifts provided to family members like McDonnell\u2019s wife and daughter. Elected officials in Virginia are allowed to accept gifts over $50, as long as they are publicly disclosed. McDonnell has reported other gifts from Williams, including a stay at a lake house and private plane travel. Williams has also given generously to McDonnell\u2019s political organization. McDonnell denies mansion allegations \u201cThe rules that I\u2019m following have been rules that have been in place for decades,\u201d McDonnell told a radio interviewer last week. \u201cThese have been the disclosure rules of Virginia. I\u2019m following those.\u201d There is no evidence that the governor granted special favors to Williams or his company in exchange for his financial largesse, a point hammered home by McDonnell loyalists. \u201cNothing that is publicly available indicates that he has broken any laws and the key point is Williams has gotten nothing, not one thing, from the administration,\u201d said one person close to the governor who did not want to be identified talking about a legal investigation. \u201cThe governor may have misreported some gifts, but it seems clear he didn\u2019t break any laws.\u201d A man under siege At the same time, McDonnell is behaving like a man under siege. He has hired a veteran communications strategist, Rich Galen, to help manage the crisis, and on Tuesday he hired a former U.S. attorney, John Brownlee, onto his private legal team. The moves suggest McDonnell is aware of the seriousness of the investigation and is bracing for a fight. The person close to the governor said the swirling controversy has \u201cbeen very hard on him personally.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s advisers insist he has no plans to resign before his term expires next January \u2013 although that calculus could change if he is indicted, a what-if scenario that has the Richmond political class buzzing. But even if federal authorities decline to pursue charges against McDonnell, he will leave office a greatly diminished politician. \u201cThe Republican now faces the real possibility of leaving Richmond next January as a Richard Nixon-like figure: embattled stonewaller disconnected from events; branded by enemies as shady, dismissed by sympathizers as na\u00efve,\u201d Schapiro, the bow-tie wearing oracle of the Times-Dispatch, wrote in a June column. \u201cThese are images that will overshadow the one profile McDonnell refined over two decades in public life: hard-working, earnest, a guy of the people rather than above them, a disciplined, self-described problem-solver.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s problems burst into pubic view in March, when The Post reported that Williams picked up the expensive catering tab for the wedding of McDonnell\u2019s daughter, a $15,000 check that McDonnell aides said he did not report because it was a \u201cgift\u201d to the newly wedded couple and not the governor. That piece of information appeared to come from Todd Schneider, the former chef of the Virginia Executive Mansion who catered the wedding but is now facing felony charges for embezzling state money. In court filings, Schneider\u2019s attorneys said that the chef alerted investigators about gifts from Williams to the McDonnell family. The initial Post story prompted other disclosures about the close relationship between Williams and the McDonnell family, including that Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell flew to Florida to promote one of Williams\u2019 supplements at a conference, and that McDonnell\u2019s political action committee hosted an lunch promoting the supplement at the governor\u2019s mansion. Williams also reportedly picked up Maureen McDonnell\u2019s tab for a $15,000 shopping binge at Bergdorf Goodman in New York, and bought the governor a $6,500 Rolex watch at her urging. None of those lavish purchases were reported by McDonnell. Some Richmond insiders initially downplayed the revelations as \u201cMaureen being Maureen,\u201d as one state House Republican put it, acknowledging the demanding reputation of McDonnell\u2019s wife. But that sentiment changed last week after The Post revealed the Rolex gift and uncovered a $70,000 payment from Williams to a company owned by McDonnell and his sister. According to the paper, McDonnell considered the payment a loan. Corporate loans are exempt from state disclosure laws. \u2018A real sea change\u2019 \u201cBetween the watch and the loan situation, that kind of turned everybody\u2019s opinion around here to, well, has he been involved in this from the beginning?\u201d said one Republican in the Capitol who is close to the administration, but would only speak on the condition of anonymity. \u201cWas he part of a concerted effort to deceive? It\u2019s been a real sea change since those stories.\u201d \u201cHe has always been honest and ethical and gone out of his way to make sure that everyone fills their positions with the highest ethics, and hold ourselves to a higher standard,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cThe prevailing sentiment around here is, that\u2019s not the guy we know.\u201d Republicans here worry that the McDonnell scandal will tarnish their standard-bearer in this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race: Cuccinelli, the state Attorney General who was hoping to use ethics as a wedge issue against his opponent, former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe. Cuccinelli has also been on the receiving end of Williams\u2019 generosity, having collected more than $18,000 in gifts from the executive and staying at his vacation house on Smith Mountain Lake. Like McDonnell, Cuccinelli failed to disclose some of these gifts and trips, though they totaled far less than what McDonnell and his family received from Williams. But Cuccinelli amended his statement of economic interest in April to include the gifts. His campaign called his omissions \u201cinadvertent.\u201d The attorney general also purchased stock in Star Scientific, but the campaign said Cuccinelli never discussed specific stock purchases with Williams. He sold off all of his holdings in Star in April \u201cupon the counsel of his financial adviser,\u201d the campaign said. Cuccinelli, though, has taken steps to separate himself from the governor, calling for more stringent ethics laws. He also initiated a state investigation into McDonnell\u2019s financial disclosures in late 2012. Last week, the Republican candidate was asked about the McDonnell saga while on the campaign trail. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve all been seeing has been very painful for Virginia, and it\u2019s been completely inconsistent with Virginia\u2019s very reserved traditions,\u201d Cuccinelli said.",

            "article_content": "There's a difference between running for president and \"running\" for president Scott Brown served part of one term in the Senate before losing his re-election bid There's almost no downside in a politician saying he's considering a presidential run Even some of his former advisers say they don't know what Brown is up to Why in the world would Scott Brown, a former half-term Senator from Mitt Romney\u2019s Massachusetts, put himself in the mix for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination? The real question is: Why not? When Brown told the Des Moines Register over the weekend that he was heading to the Iowa State Fair \u201cto determine whether there\u2019s an interest in my brand of leadership and Republicanism,\u201d the news was met with some amusement by political insiders. After all, Brown has already floated bids for New Hampshire senator and Massachusetts governor, and he doesn\u2019t seem likely to pursue either. 2016 Watch: Scott Brown makes a stop in Iowa Brown was thumped by Elizabeth Warren in his 2012 re-election bid, and he became something of a punch line earlier this year after he unleashed a volley of questionable late night tweets at some online critics. But so what? The truth is that in today\u2019s media environment, there\u2019s almost no downside for a long-shot \u201ccandidate\u201d like Brown to tell people he\u2019s mulling a White House run. For someone with no real perch other than a paid gig at Fox News, it actually makes a lot of sense. Just by going to the Iowa State Fair, a must-do for any ambitious pol, Brown will be rewarded with the only currency that matters in modern campaign politics (other than hard fundraising dollars): Buzz. Christie may OK medical marijuana bill Is the GOP worse off heading into 2016? Christie points to 2016 in RNC speech Brown: Stand strong in disappointment \u201cFunnel cake and free name ID. What\u2019s not to love?\u201d asked Will Ritter, a Boston-based GOP operative and former Mitt Romney adviser. \u201cHow many stories got posted about Ed Markey\u2019s legislative agenda yesterday? It\u2019s fun. Senator Brown\u2019s a skilled retail politician and this gives him a platform to talk about a brand of Republicanism we could use more of.\u201d For obsessive political watchers, Brown\u2019s shamelessness about the whole enterprise is kind of refreshing. \u201cI do admire the audacity to just go to the state fair and tweet about it,\u201d said Jeff Smith, a professor at the New School and regular contributor to the Washington Twitter conversation. Brown knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. Scott Brown stirs speculation with New Hampshire visit It\u2019s the same reason Iowa Rep. Steve King and New York Rep. Peter King (no relation; not even close) are \u201crefusing to rule out\u201d a 2016 bid. Will either of them be taking the oath of office one day? Nope. But with so many news platforms to fill \u2013 on television, on the web, on the radio \u2013 a presidential trial balloon or a trip to Iowa is almost guaranteed to get you at least a crumb of media exposure, a boost in stature, and maybe even a few campaign contributions down the road. Just look at this month\u2019s Family Leadership Summit, a gathering of social conservatives in Iowa that drew potential 2016 presidential contenders Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum to the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Both men seem likely to run for the Republican nomination, and both will be returning to Iowa over and over and over again in the coming years. But even if they don\u2019t, the two conservatives proved how keeping one\u2019s name in the 2016 conversation is its own reward. In their speeches, Cruz and Santorum issued a series of anti-Obama bromides and boosted their profiles with the grassroots activists who attended the Iowa summit. Neither Republican did a single thing to advance the news cycle other than board an airplane to Des Moines. Yet there they were, trailed at every turn by reporters from the Washington Post, Des Moines Register, Associated Press, New York Times, Dallas Morning News, Wall Street Journal, NBC News, ABC News and Fox News. Another Cruz trip to Iowa stokes 2016 speculation \u201cThe focus on the 2016 presidential contest is completely ridiculous, and everybody knows it,\u201d wrote David Weigel of Slate after witnessing the cattle call. Well, not completely. In our atomized media ecosystem, there\u2019s certainly a market for niche political coverage, in the same way there\u2019s a market for micro-reporting on the status of Robert Griffin III\u2019s return from knee surgery. More importantly, the presidential cycle is starting earlier than it ever has, with advisers to likely candidates working behind the scenes to assemble campaign infrastructure and peddle dirt on their potential opponents. On the Republican side, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are driving national discussions about ideology and governance. Still, there\u2019s a difference between running for president and \u201crunning\u201d for president, even though it\u2019s sometimes difficult to tell the difference. Running for president requires hard work, an ungodly amount of fundraising effort, a professional team of advisers, polling, a paid media strategy, a voter contact operation and ballot access. See: Romney, Mitt. \u201cRunning\u201d for president means doing a lot of interviews and delivering some well-timed lines in debates. See: Cain, Herman. Which category does Scott Brown fall under? For the moment, it would seem the latter. Looking at the 2016 GOP field, Christie probably has the Northeastern Republican lane all to himself, a prospect that would make it difficult for Brown to raise money. Before his Iowa trip, Brown met privately with Christie at the Republican National Committee\u2019s summer conference in Boston, a meeting first reported by the New York Times. Christie raised money for Brown several times during his Senate tenure, and, according to one Christie insider, the two are \u201cvery friendly.\u201d Then there\u2019s the fact that Brown, who supports some abortion rights, isn\u2019t exactly a hardliner on social issues that matter to so many Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. Even some of his former advisers aren\u2019t sure what he\u2019s up to. Eric Fehrnstrom, the media strategist who crafted Brown\u2019s truck-driving, regular-guy image during his stunning 2010 Senate upset, is not currently advising him, Republican sources told CNN. Asked by text message if he\u2019s serious about a presidential bid, one Republican who talks to Brown often responded: \u201cWho knows. You should call him and ask.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s acting on his own, as far as I can tell,\u201d another onetime adviser said in an e-mail. But what if Brown takes off? What if he gains a toehold in New Hampshire, rises to high single digits in the polls sometime in 2015, and gets invited to some Republican primary debates? What if he rattles off a few good lines, has his moment in the sun, and then fades? He will have lost absolutely nothing \u2013 but gained a spot on some vice presidential short lists along with a hike in his post-campaign speaking fees. Another Republican who has spoken with Brown recently isn\u2019t surprised by the sudden interest in the presidential spotlight. Brown, this person said, is a relentlessly enthusiastic guy who still takes great pride in capturing Ted Kennedy\u2019s old Senate seat. \u201cThe fact that he is in Iowa doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d the Republican told CNN. \u201cIn \u201916, it\u2019s not a bad idea to put your name out there and see where it takes you. He was enthusiastic about getting back in the national conversation. I could definitely anticipate this.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Young Republicans, a group for GOP members under 40, recently met in Mobile The GOP is having trouble with minorities, women and urbanites; YRs may have solutions Some Young Republicans want the party to focus on fiscal issues Its libertarian focus reflects the way many young people think, a historian says Tyler Deaton stands by a doorway outside Fathoms, a hotel patio lounge in this coastal town in the Deep South. Deaton, 27, is a strong believer in low taxes, fiscal responsibility and civic involvement. He attended a Christian liberal arts school. He is a Republican. He\u2019s also gay. He\u2019s been in a relationship for several years, having met his partner at Wheaton College, a Christian institution outside Chicago. Raised in Alabama, Deaton moved to New Hampshire because it approves of same-sex marriage and has no income tax or sales tax. This evening, Deaton is helping host a reception to raise interest in same-sex marriage issues among Young Republicans, who are gathered in Mobile for their national convention. Deaton is campaign manager for the young conservatives\u2019 arm of Freedom to Marry, a national gay rights group. On Deaton\u2019s side of the doorway, things are going well. Deaton and his colleagues have collected more than 50 e-mail addresses \u2013 about a sixth of the total number of conventioneers, he says. But there aren\u2019t so many on the other side. All told, perhaps two dozen people made their way to the outdoor patio, munching on the abundant food and cashing in their drink tickets. Even among the visitors there are those who do not seem completely comfortable; one man, after exclaiming how great the party is and his hopes for more approval of same-sex marriage, declined to give his name and hustled away at the sign of a reporter\u2019s notebook. It hasn\u2019t been much different at the convention as a whole. Despite Freedom to Marry statistics that indicate most Republicans under 50 approve of same-sex marriage, the group hit some roadblocks with convention organizers. Deaton\u2019s group wanted a panel discussion of LGBT issues on the official convention agenda. That request was turned down. It wanted to be a sponsor of the convention. That was also rejected. After deciding to have a reception and booking a slot, the scheduling ended up clashing with gatherings of various state groups. (After this story published, convention organizers told CNN they had previously offered to hold a debate on gay marriage between Deaton\u2019s group and another group, but Deaton rejected that idea.) It\u2019s OK, says Deaton, neatly dressed in suit and tie, in a voice that hints of his Southern upbringing. \u201cWe\u2019re not in this to make enemies or to fight,\u201d he said. Progress, he admits, will take time. It\u2019s a lesson he hopes the GOP is learning. \u201cThe GOP has become too much of a club that defines itself by who it\u2019s leaving out,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think the GOP has to do a better job of defining itself by its ideas, and letting anybody who shares those ideas come in and be a part of it.\u201d A \u2018get off my lawn\u2019 attitude The Republican Party is in a race with the future. Though it holds power in the House of Representatives and a majority of statehouses, its demographics, for now, are going the wrong direction. The country is becoming more urban and diverse, two details that favor Democrats. In 2012, blacks and Hispanics overwhelmingly went for the president; Obama also got 55% of the women\u2019s vote, 60% of voters under 30 and almost 70% of the vote in cities with 500,000 people or more. Worse than the numbers is the impression they make. In a recent study, another young GOP group, the College Republicans, put it bluntly: the GOP is seen as \u201cclosed-minded, racist, rigid, (and) old-fashioned.\u201d The Young Republicans cut a somewhat different figure than today\u2019s national GOP. They\u2019re not just younger \u2013 members range from college age to 40 \u2013 but less doctrinaire as well, preferring to focus on economics and civic involvement. The YR \u2013 the full name is the Young Republican National Federation \u2013 describes itself as \u201cthe premier Republican grassroots organization in the nation.\u201d Formerly an arm of the Republican National Committee, it\u2019s now an independent, all-volunteer group, though it still provides campaign support for conservative causes and Republican candidates. A number of noted politicians, including current House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-California, and former Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist, have come from its ranks. Volunteer executive director Soren Dayton estimates 70,000 people belong to YR chapters across the country. Much of the group\u2019s work is in civic affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s not just social networking,\u201d says Dayton, who works as a media and public affairs consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s people who serve.\u201d The group includes young professionals in their 20s and 30s and reflects a shift into more libertarian territory. John Head, a Chicago-based business development consultant, is an example of the new breed. \u201cSocial issues should not be the main focus over fiscal issues,\u201d says Head, nattily dressed for the convention in a seersucker suit and brown-and-white saddle shoes. \u201cWe have a debt problem, we have a health care problem whether you agree or disagree with what\u2019s coming, and those are things we should focus on.\u201d He sums it up succinctly: \u201cI\u2019m very involved on the fiscal side, and I\u2019m \u2018get off my lawn\u2019 on the social side.\u201d It\u2019s a small-government attitude shared by many youthful conservatives, says Arizona State University professor Donald Critchlow, a historian of the conservative movement. \u201cThere\u2019s a very, very strong libertarian voice among the young,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re very liberal \u2013 if you want to use that term \u2013 on social issues: gay rights, abortion, marijuana and war, those kinds of social issues that would put them on the left side of the spectrum. But they\u2019re coming from a libertarian perspective.\u201d These are folks who backed Ron Paul for president, or ended up voting for Obama because they disliked the GOP\u2019s stand on social issues, he says. Republicans like Deaton stay because they want to help the party resolve that tension. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be involved in something political, my goal has been to really be involved,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be harder for me if I was a Republican and not doing something to change the Republican Party.\u201d Red meat and prayers The main activities this weekend include electing new officers, renewing contacts and planning for the future. But there are bits of the boisterousness seen every four years at the parties\u2019 presidential nominating conventions. The delegations tried to outdo one another in highlighting their state\u2019s accomplishments at roll call (Head brought a blow-up Stanley Cup to showcase his Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 victory in the NHL playoffs). Some delegations hosted parties and social gatherings. There was also plenty of classic conservative red meat to be chewed. Of the handful of vendors\u2019 tables, one was sponsored by former Sen. Rick Santorum\u2019s organization, Patriot Voices. Another featured flyers from the libertarian Cato Institute for an e-book called \u201cReplacing Obamacare.\u201d One man hawked copies of his book, \u201cA Time to Kill: The Myth of Christian Pacifism.\u201d Large meetings opened with prayers, some of them in Jesus\u2019 name, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance. In speeches, there were invocations of Obamacare and the 2009 bailouts, pointed mentions of the IRS, the use of \u201cDemocrat\u201d (instead of \u201cDemocratic\u201d) as an adjective, and proud defenses of states\u2019 rights and tax cuts. For many, the convention was also an opportunity to talk about ways of moving the party forward after the losses of the 2012 election campaign. The lack of diversity was obvious at the convention\u2019s general gatherings. The majority of the 300-plus attendees were men; just a handful were Hispanic or African-American. The YR\u2019s outreach committee has been trying to find ways of expanding the tent. At a discussion, the group suggested appealing to minorities by stressing the GOP\u2019s economic message of entrepreneurship and fiscal responsibility. Outgoing YR Chair Lisa Stickan, an attorney and former prosecutor from Cleveland, believes this is a winning strategy. \u201cI think there\u2019s this misconception that younger people are only looking at social issues,\u201d Stickan said. \u201cYou have a lot of people graduating college who are in serious debt and are having trouble finding a job, and if you asked them about social issues, they would say, \u2018I\u2019m having trouble surviving here.\u2019\u201d Stickan, 35, talks with the friendly demeanor and flattened vowels of her native Midwest. She\u2019s been active with the party since law school and identified with it before then. But hers is a Main Street, grass-roots Republicanism, focused on civic involvement and fiscal rectitude. She serves on the city council of Highland Heights, a Cleveland suburb. \u201cI enjoy that because it\u2019s not a partisan role,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m there in the capacity of good-government services and working with the public.\u201d Though it\u2019s important to mention the Obama administration\u2019s faults, she says, she believes the Republicans are ill-served by Washington mudslinging. She wants the party to \u201cstep in, in a positive manner,\u201d and listen to voters. \u201cI am from a swing state, so I talk to a lot of people who are in the middle, (but) that\u2019s not what they want to hear about,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have a serious situation where people cannot get food on the table, cannot bring a paycheck home. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d \u2018You\u2019re not alone\u2019 Indeed, Stickan adds, the GOP has to keep up with the times. That means using Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to stay in touch with voters. The Democrats have been making good use of online media since at least the Howard Dean days; the Republicans are doing better but need to do more, she says. \u201cThe social media, particularly for some low-information voters or younger voters, is important, just to keep up with the trends,\u201d Stickan says. Angel Garcia, a Chicago attorney, shrewdly used the technology to help build his moribund local YR chapter from a handful of people to several hundred. The first step, Garcia said, was getting noticed. \u201cThere was nothing here, so we had to take advantage of some natural strengths,\u201d said Garcia, 38. That meant working the media, tapping into wealthy donors and getting the word out to transplants from elsewhere in the Midwest. So the club did a marketing campaign, posting ads on mass transit, billboards, even in bar restrooms. During the 2012 presidential campaign, the group made a YouTube video \u2013 a parody of \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d \u2013 that received more than 150,000 views and earned the club a mention on the Huffington Post. It has maintained aggressive Twitter and Flickr accounts. The club now has a mailing list of thousands. \u201cWe literally said, \u2018You\u2019re not alone,\u2019\u201d Garcia says. \u201cThat was really the turning point.\u201d The publicity was nothing new for Garcia, who likes the exposure. When the GOP needed a face to talk about Latino issues in Chicago, Garcia became the go-to guy. With his cleanly shaved head, nimble patter and ever-present cell phone, Garcia fits comfortably into a white-collar demographic; he\u2019s an MBA who spent several years at the Chicago Board of Trade before deciding to practice law. But he has a classic immigrant story: His parents moved to the United States from Mexico in the early \u201970s for work in the steel mills along Lake Michigan, and his father later started an auto repair business. It was small-business issues that helped turn Garcia into a Republican, he says. He entered the law partly because he saw a niche for a Spanish-speaking attorney. He characterizes himself as a \u201cneighborhood lawyer.\u201d \u2018An anti-, anti-, anti- image\u2019 Many of the Latino Young Republicans \u2013 a small but notable group at the convention \u2013 talk about their membership with mixed feelings. On the one hand, they believe in the party\u2019s small-government, faith-and-family principles. On the other, they bristle at some of the anti-immigrant talk within the party. Texas YR official Chris Carmona made the point explicitly at one breakout session. Thanks to party members\u2019 harsh words, Republicans are thought of in the Hispanic community as anti-immigrant, anti-family and anti-religious, he observes. \u201cWe have an anti-, anti-, anti- image of everything possible in the Hispanic community.\u201d Texas delegate Artemio Muniz expands on that point. Muniz, a 32-year-old from Houston, is the son of illegal immigrants. His family was on welfare, sold chips at the ballpark and took items from trash bins to sell. \u201cWe started at the bottom,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know what bootstrapping means.\u201d His parents were given amnesty as part of a 1986 immigration reform bill signed by Ronald Reagan. He grimaces when he thinks about how some Republicans treat Latinos. \u201cI\u2019ve been at Tea Party meetings where the lady is saying, \u2018Let\u2019s deport them all,\u2019 and the lady that\u2019s serving her is an illegal immigrant bringing her nacho chips.\u201d But he became a Republican, he says, because the party represents promise. The Mexican community has pride, he says, and its beliefs fit with the conservatism of the Republican Party and its leaders. \u201cReagan was a legit guy that understood the heart,\u201d he says. \u201c(George W.) Bush as well. He understood. He had credibility. He was authentic. He knew the experience of being a Texan.\u201d But the GOP has to recognize the problems of the working class, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like any other blue-collar neighborhood,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Hispanic thing necessarily. Your guy that\u2019s living paycheck to paycheck can be any race, and here\u2019s a party saying we\u2019re going to cut programs. They want to know, what are you going to do to help the family? It\u2019s more of being in touch with hard-working people.\u201d His YR colleague Garcia has mixed feelings about the congressional stalemate over the immigration reform bill, which was passed by the Senate in late June but is being held up in the House. He\u2019d like to see a narrower bill, one that could get more Republican support. \u201cDemocrats moving the goalposts makes that less likely,\u201d he says. But, he admits, Republicans still look bad. \u201cAt the end of the day I\u2019m a pragmatist, and I understand politics,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve done a poor job framing the issue.\u201d The \u2018Akin effect\u2019 The communications problems also apply to women. Christina Goodlander of the D.C. delegation summed up the issue in two words: \u201cAkin effect\u201d \u2013 a reference to Todd Akin, the Missouri U.S. Senate candidate who made controversial comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and pregnancy. While noting that Akin\u2019s words were \u201cpretty horrible,\u201d \u201cthose comments were played over and over again nationally, and we were portrayed as troglodytes,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about, but that became the narrative and the Democrats played that brilliantly.\u201d Stickan wishes more people would pay attention to strength of women in the GOP. \u201cI think there\u2019s this perception that Republicans don\u2019t engage women enough, or that we\u2019re not listening to women,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been talked to and listened to by many campaigns. You may have someone who goes out there and makes a comment, and just because he\u2019s one person doesn\u2019t mean he speaks for the whole party.\u201d Moreover, she adds, the party has a good bench, including South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and others at local levels. \u201cWe have some amazing candidates being elected all over the country. I think it\u2019s important to showcase them,\u201d she says. One of those women, Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama, gave a stemwinder at a convention lunch. The 36-year-old Roby, a Young Republican herself, exhorted her listeners to push their way to the front. \u201cNow, more than ever, our party needs bright young people engaged in meaningful conversation, with fresh ways to implement our conservative ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cNow is your turn.\u201d In an interview later, Roby reiterated her hope that more young Republicans will get involved, but emphasized that she sees the problem to be less a matter of Republican principles than Republican messaging. \u201cIt\u2019s not about becoming Democrat-lite, it\u2019s about staying true to the conservative principles we hold dear,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to find a different way to talk about it.\u201d Reaching across the aisle Whether the Young Republicans will change the GOP is an open question. Some have plans to run for office; others expect to stay behind the scenes, working on grass-roots organizing or consulting. And though there appear to be fewer differences among Young Republicans than in the national GOP, social issues can still cause friction. One Southern delegate was enthusiastic about the focus on entrepreneurship, but his voice quieted when he pondered pitching same-sex marriage to his state. It\u2019s a longstanding split. George W. Bush found it challenging to unite the party on immigration. His father found favor with religious conservatives but lost the fiscally minded with the 1990 budget deal. Indeed, about the only GOP politician who\u2019s succeeded in bridging the chasm, says historian Critchlow, is Ronald Reagan. He dealt with various conservative blocs both as California governor and president and showed a willingness to talk with Democrats \u2013 whether it was the legislature of California Speaker Jesse Unruh or the House of Tip O\u2019Neill. Still, the Young Republicans are determined to try to expand the party\u2019s base \u2013 even to the point of metaphorically crossing the aisle. Encouraged by Stickan, the outreach committee struck an agreement with the National Urban League \u2013 an African-American advocacy group that favors Democrats \u2013 to partner on an Urban League program. The Urban League runs entrepreneurship centers in 10 cities focused on improving business skills and mentoring among minorities, and the Young Republicans saw that the program aligned with their own principles, said Darius Foster, a Birmingham consultant and member of the Alabama Young Republicans. \u201cWe might disagree with 85 or 90% of what they do, but that 10%, we can use that as inroads with the Urban League and their members,\u201d said Christopher Sanders, a Young Republican from Atlanta. The Georgia capital is going to be one of the partnership\u2019s test cities, along with Houston and Cleveland. The YRs also paid tribute to the social-media and outreach activities of Garcia\u2019s Chicago chapter by recognizing it as the year\u2019s \u201coutstanding large club,\u201d an award Garcia said was unexpected. As he nears 40 and aging out of the Young Republicans, he\u2019s taking on one more job \u2013 Midwest regional coordinator \u2013 and believes the party is primed to make inroads. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to these things since I could vote, and this is the first time I\u2019m hearing people from the top of the party down talk about issues and talk about actual strategies that are actionable,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cWe have work to do, but it\u2019s more diverse, and more representative of what the party really is, than what I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Deaton, the gay Young Republican from New Hampshire, hopes that\u2019s true. He wants action, not just talk. The concept some national leaders have pushed \u2013 \u201cbetter messaging\u201d \u2013 drives him up a wall. \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is there\u2019s actually nothing wrong with the Republican Party. We just don\u2019t talk about it the right way,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the problem is that some of the beliefs are also wrong. I think Americans are hungry for fiscal conservatism. I think, though, that they want a bit of a more humble foreign policy than what the GOP has been offering for the last decade, and they do want the Republican Party to take a new approach on social issues. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just mean repackaging or putting a new label on it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to change the recipe.\u201d",

            "article_content": "States are increasingly passing restrictive abortion laws Increase is due to larger number of conservative-controlled statehouses, governorships Goal is to use possible challenge to state law to get Supreme Court to revisit Roe v. Wade When Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed some of the country\u2019s toughest abortion restrictions into law on Thursday, his state joined a growing number of those strategically pushing the limits of federal abortion rights that have been in place for 40 years. \u201cIn signing House Bill 2 today, we \u2026 cement the culture of life, which Texas is built upon,\u201d Perry said during the signing ceremony. \u201cChildren do deserve the respect of simple recognition before their lives are cut tragically short.\u201d His reference to the \u201cculture of life\u201d was no coincidence. Nor was the bill becoming law. Perry signs abortion bill into law As the nation focused on a Republican takeover of the U.S. House during the 2010 midterm elections, an even bigger conservative revolution was taking place in the states: one that, three years later, is having big implications for state legislative battles over reproductive rights. In 2010, the GOP gained the majority of governorships, and one-fifth of the nation\u2019s state legislatures switched to complete Republican control, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. Before the 2010 election, 14 state legislatures were Republican-controlled. After those elections, the GOP controlled 24 statehouses, according to the data. The partisan shift took place in such states as North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, some of the very states that have since pushed some of the nation\u2019s most stringent abortion regulations. In Texas, Perry won re-election, and Republicans made major gains in the statehouse, which netted that party full control of state government. 'Moral Monday' protests rock in N.C. N.C. Speaker heckled over abortion bill Wendy Davis: Filibuster 'amazing moment' While most of the candidates ran on conservative economic rather than social platforms, such views tend to be part of \u201cpart of the candidate\u2019s profile,\u201d said Mary Spaulding Balch, director of the department of state legislation for the National Right to Life organization. In the states, there has been a trend of gaining \u201csupport in the elections where they are electing pro-life legislators, and the legislation is passing by a greater margin,\u201d she said. Those gains were coupled with a concerted effort by anti-abortion groups \u2013 which since the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision had been stymied at the federal level \u2013 to turn to the state level to push and pass legislation favorable to their cause, said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. \u201cIt was this perfect storm to enact abortion restrictions,\u201d Nash said. New laws flout \u2013 or use \u2013 Roe v. Wade provisions in restricting abortions The effects are being felt across the country. In Texas, the new law bans abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandates that abortion clinics become ambulatory surgical centers, tightens usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they\u2019re providing such services. As it wended its way through the statehouse, the measure resulted in a high-profile showdown, and Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis undertook an 11-hour filibuster to try to block its passage. In North Carolina, the House of Representatives passed a measure placing requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed. The bill allows North Carolina\u2019s health department to make temporary new rules for the state\u2019s 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit and prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, to pay for abortions \u2013 though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman\u2019s life. Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, John Kasich, recently signed into law a state budget that includes measures that will require ultrasounds for anyone seeking an abortion and limit abortion clinics from transferring patients to public hospitals. If they need more care after a procedure, patients will now have to seek out a private hospital. The budget will also make it more difficult for family planning groups in the Buckeye State to obtain funding for preventive care. And it puts Planned Parenthood behind clinics that don\u2019t provide abortions when it comes to obtaining state funding. In Wisconsin, a federal judge recently granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new law banning doctors from performing abortions if they don\u2019t have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 miles of their practice. Ultimately, anti-abortion advocates hope that some of the recently passed state legislation will force the Supreme Court to revisit issues addressed in Roe v. Wade. \u201cI think that\u2019s what they\u2019re angling for \u2026 getting the Supreme Court to reconsider it,\u201d said Michele Swers, a Georgetown University American government professor. Anti-abortion groups acknowledge as much and point to such issues as the medically controversial language in several state bills stating that a fetus feels pain after 20 weeks. Courts in several states have blocked measures containing this language. \u201cIf the laws were challenged and made its way to the court, we would argue the court has never looked at these issues before,\u201d  Spaulding Balch said.

            "article_content": "Democrats threaten drastic means in Senate on Obama nominees Republicans in the House continue their assault on Obamacare Abortion restrictions move closer to law in Texas, North Carolina A clash in Congress over Obamacare and a nasty filibuster fight over the president\u2019s nominees will make headlines in the week ahead, and two state capitals are in the national spotlight because of developments in the divisive battle over abortion. 1. Senate might go nuclear Partisanship may reach new heights in the Senate on Tuesday. That\u2019s when Senate Democrats may move to dramatically limit Senate filibusters, over the angry objections of Republicans who warn the move would shatter any bipartisan cooperation in the chamber. Can Congress get any more toxic? The Democrats, who hold a 54-46 majority in the Senate, have long threatened to use the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d to push through rules changes for filibusters of executive branch appointments. They argue that Senate Republicans have abused the use of filibusters to stonewall Obama administration nominees. \u201cI took Sen. (Mitch) McConnell at his word, said that he would only do this filibuster stuff under extraordinary circumstances. I guess being in session is an extraordinary circumstance,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Thursday. Republicans argue they have cleared nearly all the president\u2019s executive branch picks and that the Democrats are playing politics and overstating the problem. \u201cThis is really a sad, sad day for the United States Senate.  And if we don\u2019t pull back from the brink here, my friend the majority leader is going to be remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever,\u201d said McConnell, the Senate minority leader. Two sides of Obamacare Texas House votes on measure Obamacare affordable for small business? Obamacare punt: Delay or death knell? Republicans warned Democrats that they were on a slippery slope, as they may find themselves in the minority again. The Democrats are defending 21 of the 35 seats up for grabs in next year\u2019s midterm elections. All 100 senators are invited to a meeting Monday night to discuss the controversy. 2. Another vote on Obamacare The GOP-led House of Representatives is expected to vote on delaying two key components of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. The move by House Republicans comes after the administration announced that implementation of a crucial part of the Affordable Care Act was being delayed a year. The requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees provide their workers with health insurance or face fines will now kick in at the start of 2015. Republicans continue assault on Obamacare House Speaker John Boehner said his chamber would hold a vote on pushing back the employer mandate, as well as vote to delay by a year the implementation of the mandate that the vast majority of Americans must have health insurance or face fines. The individual mandate is the most controversial part of Obamacare. The law was passed in 2010, when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. \u201cI believe it\u2019s unfair to protect big business from Obamacare but not individuals and families,\u201d Boehner said at his weekly news conference. Since retaking control of chamber in the 2010 midterm elections, House Republicans have voted nearly 40 times to repeal or defund all or parts of the health care reform law. The push for a vote on the individual mandate is seen as a deliberate political move by House Republicans to force their Democratic counterparts to go on the record in support of the president\u2019s health care policy, which could cause problems for some Democrats up for re-election next year in competitive districts. 3. N.C. abortion bill in Senate\u2019s hands A restrictive abortion bill in North Carolina could become law in the week ahead. The state\u2019s GOP-dominated House of Representatives passed the bill Thursday by a 74-41 vote. The bill now heads to the state Senate, which is also controlled by Republicans. N.C. House passes restrictive abortion bill The bill would place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed. The measure allows North Carolina\u2019s health department to make temporary new rules for the state\u2019s 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit. It also prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, from paying for abortions \u2013 though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman\u2019s life. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, vowed to veto an earlier abortion bill passed by the state Senate, but says he won\u2019t veto the legislation passed Thursday by the state House. McCrory said during his 2012 campaign for governor that he would not sign any further restrictions on abortion into law. 4. Texas abortion bill goes to governor A controversial measure that would place new limits on abortions in Texas heads to Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s desk. The bill was just passed by both houses of the GOP-dominated legislature, amid protests by demonstrators on both sides of the abortion battle. After divisive debate, Texas Senate approves restrictive abortion bill The measure would ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, require abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, tighten usage guidelines for the drug RU486, and require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they\u2019re providing abortion services. \u201cMost people in this country, and in Texas certainly, believe that six months is too late to be deciding whether these babies should be aborted or not. And we put the limit at five months in this bill,\u201d Perry told CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. Perry defends strict abortion law The bill was sidetracked last month thanks to a filibuster by a Democratic state senator, which captured national attention. That move led Perry to call a special session of the legislature so lawmakers could once again try to pass the bill. 5. Lights still burning after 24 years Former President George H.W. Bush will be back at the White House on Monday, celebrating a milestone for a service initiative started in his administration. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will host the event to celebrate the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award, according to the White House. George H.W. Bush returns to White House for milestone Calling volunteers who serve their communities \u201ca thousand points of light\u201d in his 1989 inaugural address, Bush went on to award Daily Point of Light awards to honor citizens who make a difference through their volunteer work. The Points of Light Foundation is now the world\u2019s largest service organization coordinating volunteer projects.  Bush serves as honorary chairman of the nonpartisan, nonprofit foundation, and his son Neil Bush is the president of the organization. \u201cMonday\u2019s event brings together two presidents and families united in their commitment to growing volunteerism and service \u2013 an issue with a long history of strong bipartisan support,\u201d the White House said. Bush is excited about the milestone, spokesman Jim McGrath said.  \u201cIt should be a special day for the service movement,\u201d McGrath said. Former first lady Barbara Bush and other members of the Bush family will also attend. The 89-year-old former president has battled health problems and was hospitalized last winter suffering complications related to bronchitis. Bush also has a form of Parkinson\u2019s disease that affects his legs and requires him to use a wheelchair.",

            "article_content": "Court revises 60-year-old regulation after man silently holding sign challenged rules Law clarifies protests on grounds; still can't demonstrate on plaza or inside Protests usually held on sidewalk outside court steps opposite Capitol New rules exempt casual behavior not likely to attract a crowd or onlookers The grounds outside the U.S. Supreme Court have long been a place for protests, rallies, and other \u201cexpressive events.\u201d But exactly just what could be said and where the public could assert its First Amendment rights was a source of contention  \u2013 at least until Thursday. That\u2019s when court officials issued new rules. The regulations clarify a 60-year-old law blocking any demonstrations on court property, including the marble plaza that serves as the dramatic gateway to the building itself. \u201cThe term demonstration includes demonstrations, picketing, speechmaking, marching, holding vigils or religious services and all other like forms of conduct that involve the communication or expression of views or grievances, engaged in by one or more persons, the conduct of which is reasonably likely to draw a crowd or onlookers,\u201d says the revised Regulation 7, which was effective Thursday. \u201cThe term does not include casual use by visitors or tourists that is not reasonably likely to attract a crowd or onlookers.\u201d The changes follow a federal judge\u2019s ruling on Wednesday tossing out as unconstitutional the previous anti-demonstration rules. Judge Beryl Howell said those laws were overly broad and vague, and could implicate any \u201cgroup activity\u201d on the grounds, including students wearing t-shirts with the name of their school, or tourists gathering on the plaza for a group photo. Federal law gives individual buildings and agencies, including courts, discretion to set their own security and access procedures. Harold Hodge, Jr., had challenged the regulations in court. The Maryland college student was arrested in February 2011 for silently carrying an anti-racism sign on the plaza, although court records show he did so peacefully. A court police officer approached Hodge and three times asked him to leave the plaza, but he refused. He was then handcuffed and taken into custody. The charges were dropped after Hodge agreed not to return to the court for six months. He later sued, claiming his free speech rights were being violated and that he had a right to protest on government property. A Virginia-based civil rights group, the Rutherford Institute, defended Hodge in his case. The group\u2019s president, John Whitehead, called the high court\u2019s new rules set by its Marshal\u2019s office \u201crepugnant\u201d to the guarantees enshrined in the Constitution. Protests, rallies, speeches, and marches in front of the court often number in the hundreds of people, and are traditionally held on the public sidewalk on First Street, NE, between the court and the Capitol. Demonstrators gathered for days during the 2000 Bush v. Gore case over the disputed outcome of the presidential election. And those on both sides of the abortion debate rally yearly in front of the court on the January anniversary of Roe v. Wade decision. The Supreme Court had no comment on the rule changes.",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court rejects case without comment Lawsuit stemmed from ad about Barack Obama in 2008 campaign Group argued its issue advocacy not subject to federal regulation An anti-abortion group will not get a hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court on its appeal of federal law designating it as a political nonprofit that must disclose information about its financial donors. The Justices rejected the case involving the The Real Truth About Abortion, Inc. without comment on Monday. The Virginia-based group, formally known as The Real Truth About Obama, argued that its \u201cissue advocacy\u201d was protected free speech and not subject to federal regulation, since it did not \u201cexpressly advocate the election or defeat\u201d or \u201cmake any contribution\u201d to a political candidate. Organizations labeled \u201cpolitical action committees\u201d are subject to longstanding requirements regarding donor contributions and spending limits. Generally PACs are organizations advocating for or against a candidate, legislation, ballot initiative, or general issue like abortion. They are often backed by corporations, unions, and trade associations. Other PACs like issue advocacy groups are not connected or sponsored by any related entity and are free to solicit funds from the general public. A number of groups complained federal controls were overly broad, vague, and arbitrarily applied. Real Truth case stemmed from plans to spend money on two radio advertisements about Barack Obama\u2019s positions when he was running for president in 2008. The Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission resisted the effort, resulting in a lawsuit. The case was initially litigated while the high court decided a related blockbuster appeal called Citizens United v. FEC. The 5-4 conservative majority allowed corporations, labor unions, and a range of issue advocacy groups to use their general treasury funds for electioneering. That 2010 decision opened up corporate spending for federal campaigns, leading to complaints the integrity of the political system was being corrupted by unlimited amounts of money being poured into elections. But that decision did not affect the current ban on direct corporate or union contributions to federal campaigns. Groups wanting to do so still must organize separate PACs. The case is Real Truth About Abortion v. FEC (12-311).",

            "article_content": "74-year-old \"patriot\" group founder says her Granny Warriors are harmless Southern Poverty Law Center: The number of such groups has risen by 7% in the past year Ex-FBI informant David Gletty expects anti-government sentiment will worsen The number of American \u201cpatriot\u201d extremist groups has reached a record level, according to a new study, and experts are warning of a wave of anti-government violence. A report released Tuesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center counted 1,360 \u201cpatriot\u201d extremist groups in 2012 \u2013 up by 7% from 2011. The study defines patriot groups as anti-government militias driven by their fear that authorities will strip them of their guns and liberties. \u201cThey believe the Constitution is being raped. With hate groups, things are going to get worse because they feel like they\u2019re in battle,\u201d said David Gletty a former FBI informant who spent time undercover with various militia and extremist groups. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising with their hatred of President (Barack) Obama that there are even more hate groups out there.\u201d The study said California has the most patriot extremist groups, with 81. The SPLC report also offers a bit of good news: The number of \u201cimmigrant-bashing\u201d extremist groups \u2013 so-called nativism organizations \u2013 is way down from 2011, falling by 88%. Related: Oberlin College cancels classes to address racial incidents The new statistics come after a string of crimes linked to extremist groups. A year ago, a Michigan militia leader and his son pleaded guilty to federal gun charges. Last August, a 40-year-old ex-soldier-turned singer for a white supremacist rock band shot up a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six people, before taking his own life. A few weeks later, a group of Georgia men was linked to an anti-government militia plot to assassinate Obama. Obama\u2019s election as the first African-American president and his pro-gun control stance have fueled the increase in anti-government groups, according to the report. \u201cWe are seeing a huge reaction to the potential for gun control, and that reaction is so angry that it\u2019s hard not to be afraid of what\u2019s coming down the road,\u201d said Mark Potok of the SPLC. Domestic terror: Are we doing enough? The rise in such groups echoes a period almost 20 years ago, around the time when Congress passed the 1993 Brady Bill and the 1994 ban on assault weapons, the SPLC said. That legislation came near a period of infamous and deadly anti-government violence in Waco, Texas; Ruby Ridge, Idaho; and Oklahoma City, \u201cand led to the first wave of the patriot movement,\u201d the report said. Extremists, Gletty warned, \u201care in a battle in their minds. Their backs are against the wall.\u201d They are in a battle in their minds. Their backs are against the wall. David Gletty, ex-FBI informant Skeptics But Jesse Walker, of the Reason Foundation and author of an upcoming book, \u201cThe United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory,\u201d  said counting groups isn\u2019t a good way to measure the threat. \u201cIt\u2019s dubious to assume growth in numbers is related to violence.\u201d Also, the center\u2019s definition of hate groups has changed in the past year, kicking up a controversy. Critics accused the group of unfairly bundling together organizations with vastly different points of view \u2013 and painting them all as potentially violent. For example a North Carolina-based group calling itself \u201cGranny Warriors\u201d appears on the SPLC list of active \u201cpatriots.\u201d But founder Linda Hunnicutt says her organization is harmless. \u201cI am deadly!\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019m 74 years old. I have COPD. I have congestive heart failure. I\u2019m sewing a quilt.\u201d Hunnicutt acknowledges she\u2019s no friend of the federal government, but, she wishes no harm on anyone. \u201cAll these people that want to bomb places and kill children, come on,\u201d she said. \u201cWho would be in sympathy with them?\u201d Hunnicutt said she and her group just want Uncle Sam to leave them alone. When Granny Warriors showed up on the SPLC list, Hunnicutt said she wasn\u2019t surprised. But it made her wonder, \u201cIs this all they have to do?\u201d Nonetheless, Hunnicutt\u2019s thankful to be on the list because she said it increases her group\u2019s notoriety. Fringe elements Gletty said most of the fringe elements characterized in the report hate the government more than they do specific races. They hate everyone, Gletty said. Now a private investigator, Gletty spent years undercover as an FBI informant watching the internal workings of white supremacist groups. The groups named in the SPLC study came from information compiled from \u201cfield reports, Patriot publications, the Internet, law enforcement sources and news reports.\u201d Other highlights of the report include: \u2013 The state with the most neo-Nazi groups: California, with 9. \u2013 The state with the most Ku Klux Klan groups: Texas, with 26. \u2013 The report breaks out a group it calls \u201cChristian Identity,\u201d which the SLPC defines as \u201ca religion that is fundamentally racist and anti-Semitic.\u201d Texas has the most, with five. \u2013 Another category in the report, called \u201cGeneral Hate,\u201d is defined as groups that are anti-gay, Holocaust deniers, racist musicians or radical traditionalist Catholics. California has the most such groups, with 37. \u201cThe country needs to do better,\u201d Potok wrote in an editorial. The Department of Homeland Security, he said, needs to act to avoid a repeat of the kind of hate-based violence the nation saw in the 1990s.",

The media mocks her. But Sarah Palin isn\u2019t going anywhere. Far from it. After laying low for much of this year, Palin is gingerly stepping back into the public arena with a national book tour, a trip to the always-important political state of Iowa, and an eye on making yet another series of splashy endorsements in a variety of competitive Republican primaries. Five years after rocketing from Alaska obscurity to worldwide fame, Palin wants to be a political player in 2014. Which raises the question: Does she still matter? Sarah Palin: Gone rogue Political theater at rally Palin preparing political comeback? Palin being sued over iconic 9/11 photo \u201cShe is the most important endorsement in Republican politics today, by far,\u201d said Sal Russo, a Republican consultant who co-founded the Tea Party Express, a group that has booked Palin to speak at numerous public events dating back to the 2010 midterm cycle. \u201cShe can move the needle in a primary more than anyone else can.\u201d Palin: Hillary Clinton ill-suited for president Her detractors see things differently. After flirting with a presidential bid and stirring up a tidal wave of media attention in the run-up to the 2012 Iowa caucuses, with a slew of punchy speeches and a madcap bus tour of historical sites along the East Coast, Palin eventually decided to pass on a shot at the White House. When her presidential potential evaporated, a number of Republicans said, so did her relevance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that she has the juice that she had four years ago, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Katon Dawson, a GOP fundraiser in South Carolina who runs a Super PAC backing Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the Senate\u2019s batch of endangered old guard Republicans up for re-election in 2014. \u201cShe does have a following and when she speaks, people listen. I just don\u2019t know if that voice is as loud or as important as it used to be.\u201d Dawson said he gives Palin \u201ccredit for monetizing her run for vice president,\u201d a backhanded compliment that appropriately sums up the feelings of eye-rolling GOP professionals everywhere, who wish she would disappear back into the frigid wilderness of the Last Frontier. Palin\u2019s standing as a serious political figure, already tenuous, has seemingly been in decline ever since she decided not to run for president and saw conservatives sidelined as Mitt Romney captured the Republican nomination, only to lose to President Barack Obama. Obeidallah: Sarah Palin\u2019s offensive remarks about Syria Pundit or political player? Sarah Palin stumps in N.J. Senate race Steve Lonegan calls upon Palin star power Is Sarah Palin preparing for 2016? Ted Cruz the male Sarah Palin? In reporting her upcoming speech to the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition on November 9, The Des Moines Register this month described her on first reference as \u201cconservative pundit Sarah Palin,\u201d rather than the honorifics usually bestowed on her, \u201cformer vice presidential candidate\u201d and \u201cformer Alaska governor.\u201d Contributions to her political action committee, Sarah PAC, tapered off after she passed on a presidential bid. Earlier this year, she publicly parted ways with Fox News, where she had been employed as a paid analyst since 2010 (she re-joined the network five months later). Palin hasn\u2019t been completely absent from politics in 2013. She issued a range of political pronouncements on her Facebook page, attacking President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats, taking particular umbrage at their efforts to scale back gun rights. And in March, she delivered one of the more well-received speeches at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. But she has devoted much of her energies this year to a Christmas-themed book, \u201cGood Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas,\u201d that will release in November and launch her on a multicity book tour through states like Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Texas and Arizona (the promotional tour also offers her a loophole to appear on other television networks). It was the 16-day partial government shutdown, a fight sparked by Republican-led efforts to dismantle Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, that energized Palin once again, those around her say. Palin jumps into defund-Obamacare effort She has been impressed, one Palin aide said, by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee, two tea party stalwarts who helped orchestrate the defund-Obamacare movement that led to the shutdown and set off a new round of establishment-versus-grassroots warfare inside the Republican Party. \u201cThere is a need to step up now,\u201d said one Palin aide who declined to go on the record like most people around her usually do. \u201cShe steps up when she sees there is a need. She sees the fire that Ted Cruz and Mike Lee have started.\u201d Palin opened the door last week to helping unseat Graham in South Carolina and a number of other incumbent Republicans, including Sen. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee. \u2018Going to shake things up\u2019 Palin on her political future Palin: Politicians exploit emotions Palin threatens to chew tobacco on stage \u201cWe\u2019re going to shake things up in 2014,\u201d Palin wrote on Facebook, still her preferred public megaphone. \u201cRest well tonight, for soon we must focus on important House and Senate races. Let\u2019s start with Kentucky \u2013 which happens to be awfully close to South Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi \u2013 from sea to shining sea we will not give up. We\u2019ve only just begun to fight.\u201d Palin sued over alleged use of iconic 9/11 image The post, which was \u201cliked\u201d by more than 31,000 of her followers, was rapidly picked up by a range of conservative websites. Palin\u2019s small circle of advisers received an uptick in their usual flood of speaking requests, one adviser said, including from some of the insurgent conservative candidates running for Senate. One of those who reached out was Chris McDaniel, a state senator from Mississippi gunning to take out six-term Sen. Thad Cochran, a low-key but powerful member of the upper chamber who has served in Washington for more than three decades. McDaniel has already been endorsed by three conservative outfits, the Club For Growth, the Madison Project and the Senate Conservatives Fund, hungry to unseat Cochran. McDaniel said Palin\u2019s endorsement, if it comes, would be an unquestionable boon, especially in a deep red state like Mississippi, where GOP primaries are dominated by a small-but-motivated base electorate. Even during the high-profile Republican presidential primary of 2012, only about 300,000 people cast ballots. That\u2019s in a state with nearly 2 million registered voters. \u201cSarah Palin understands that there is a movement out there of good conservatives and just regular people,\u201d McDaniel told CNN. \u201cShe taps into that. We would absolutely welcome her.\u201d Paul happy with Palin\u2019s praise, stays out of Cruz debate Palin\u2019s ability to propel tea party-aligned candidates into office was a well-documented phenomenon in 2010, when she endorsed over 60 Senate, House and gubernatorial candidates, the majority of whom won. Her midterm travels even inspired The Washington Post to launch a \u201cPalin Endorsements Tracker,\u201d complete with clickable audio of a growling grizzly bear, an homage to her self-styled \u201cMama Grizzly\u201d image. A \u2018media blowtorch\u2019 Though Palin\u2019s political action committee, Sarah PAC, doled out contributions to her favored candidates, her endorsements bring more than just hard dollars. When Palin showed up in South Carolina to endorse Nikki Haley during her 2010 gubernatorial primary, a race Haley went on to win, a  Republican working for a rival campaign calculated that the event generated \u201cover a million dollars\u201d in television and radio coverage. \u201cThere was absolutely no way when that endorsement came down to break through the news cycle,\u201d the Republican said of Palin. \u201cIt was an earned media blowtorch.\u201d Palin\u2019s star was burning much hotter in 2010 than it is today, but she demonstrated similar clout last year in Nebraska\u2019s three-way Republican Senate primary \u2013 and she did so without even traveling to corn country. In that race, establishment figures had lined up behind attorney general Jon Bruning, while outside conservative groups like FreedomWorks and the Club For Growth backed state treasurer Don Stenberg, who also had the backing of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. But Palin jumped in the race late and got behind Deb Fischer, a little-known state legislator, pushing her over the finish line and stunning the political class in Washington. Fischer coasted to a win in November and is now a United States senator. The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call described the Palin endorsement as \u201can adrenaline shot six days before the GOP primary.\u201d Fischer\u2019s campaign manager, Aaron Trost, said Palin helped them \u201cdictate the tempo of the last week of the campaign.\u201d All Palin did was post a statement of support online. \u201cBefore she endorsed we were down four points, within the margin of error and coming up slightly, and then all of a sudden the  narrative changed and we dominated the news cycle,\u201d Trost said. \u201cPeople who underestimate the power of her endorsement are going to be really sorry. People that write her off don\u2019t understand Republican primaries.\u201d Given the tea party\u2019s toxic national brand \u2013 only 31% of Americans had a favorable view of the conservative movement in a recent CNN poll \u2013 Palin\u2019s sway is almost certainly limited to Republican primaries. Democrats welcomed polarizing Palin to Garden State Earlier this month, Palin campaigned on behalf of New Jersey Republican Senate candidate Steve Lonegan, who ultimately fell to Democrat Cory Booker in last week\u2019s special election. Palin campaigns for New Jersey Senate hopeful Like few Republicans can, she attracted thousands of fired-up, flag-waving conservatives to an out-of-the-way motor speedway in the middle of the state, but Democrats were equally pumped to welcome the polarizing Palin to the Garden State. \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s endorsing Lonegan thrills both parties,\u201d read one headline in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Still, Palin continues to wield great influence among grassroots conservatives, Trost argued, especially in Republican primaries in right-leaning states like Nebraska, where winning a primary all-but-guarantees a general election victory over token Democratic opposition. About 200,000 people participated in last year\u2019s Nebraska Senate primary, and Fischer essentially won a Senate seat with barely 80,000 votes. \u201cPeople forget about this sometimes, but because Sarah Palin has a child with Down syndrome, a lot of people in the pro-life community view her as not just talking the talk about pro-life but walking the walk,\u201d Trost said. \u201cSocial issues play a big factor in a low turnout Republican primary.\u201d Despite Palin\u2019s veiled threat to campaign against veteran senators like McConnell, Cochran, Alexander and Graham, her endorsement history reveals a preference for dabbling in open primaries, rather than endorsing challengers over incumbents. There\u2019s also the fact that each of those senators has a long-standing relationship with her former ticket-mate and political patron from 2008, Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom she continues to hold in high esteem, people close to her say. As for Graham, one of McCain\u2019s closest pals, Palin donated $1,000 to his 2014 re-election campaign through her PAC back in 2009. Aligning herself with tea party\u2019s new guard At the same time, Palin is now aligning herself with members of the tea party\u2019s uncompromising new guard, especially Cruz, who has made plain his distaste for old bull Senate leadership. Palin\u2019s relationship with Cruz dates to last year, when she endorsed him during his underdog Republican primary bid in 2012. It was Cruz who introduced Palin when she spoke at CPAC in March. During the shutdown, Palin and her husband Todd traveled to Washington to appear with Cruz and Lee at a rally to re-open the temporarily shuttered World War II memorial. The backstory on the veterans rally in Washington The conservative quartet later joined up with Cruz\u2019s wife for lunch at Hill Country Barbecue, a casual downtown Washington restaurant known for its brisket. Chip Roy, Cruz\u2019s chief-of-staff, said Palin and the senator were often in communication during the shutdown, he said he expects their back-and-forth to continue into the midterm cycle. \u201cThere is enormous respect between the two, and there is increasing communication between the offices,\u201d Roy told CNN. \u201cAs the year has progressed, I think Palin has been pretty simpatico with what Sen. Cruz and Sen. Lee have been trying to accomplish over the last year, fighting these debates, talking to the American people and challenging the status quo.\u201d",

The former Republican governor of South Carolina, whose political career was left for dead along the Appalachian Trail after an extramarital affair, asked for, and Tuesday received, political redemption as he won a special election to fill a vacant House seat that he once occupied. \u201cI want to acknowledge a God not just of second chances but third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth chances, because that is the reality of our shared humanity,\u201d Sanford said at his victory celebration after defeating his Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch. \u201cI am one imperfect man saved by God\u2019s grace.\u201d 5 things we learned from Sanford\u2019s win And at a news conference minutes later, Sanford added that \u201cI think we\u2019re always on the search for redemption and I think this is certainly a degree of political redemption.\u201d Sanford, who won 54% to 45%, according to an unofficial vote count in South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District, made reference to his political baggage from his infamous affair. Photos: A second chance in politics Mark Sanford wins comeback race Mark Sanford wins a second chance Sanford burned on affair in debate Mark Sanford 'debates' Pelosi poster \u201cIf it was just about market-based ideas and limited government, this campaign would have easily won a long time ago. But I had deficiencies that are well chronicled as a candidate and at the end of the day I was carried across the threshold, if you will, by an incredible team of volunteers.\u201d Colbert Busch, an official with Clemson University\u2019s wind turbine drive testing facility who was best known nationally as the sister of satirist and Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, said that, \u201cThe people have spoken and I respect their decision.\u201d But she added that \u201cWe gave it a heck of fight\u201d and assured supporters that \u201cI will continue to fight for the people of South Carolina.\u201d Sanford won all five counties in the district, including Charleston and Beaufort, home to Hilton Head, where some Democrats hoped that older voters would be turned off by Sanford\u2019s scandals and just stay home. In Charleston County, Sanford\u2019s home base but the Democrats\u2019 best hope as well, he narrowly edged out Colbert Busch. Colbert Busch won absentee ballots, but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to carry her to victory. Sanford: Primary win was \u2018a big referendum\u2019 on comeback effort \u201cTurnout was very large for a special election \u2013 roughly a quarter of the 18-plus population voted, more than 140,000 votes total,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, who analyzed the vote. \u201cThat seems to have helped Sanford.  Low turnout would have meant a lot of Republicans who were reluctant to vote for him and wouldn\u2019t vote for a Democrat. High turnout turns that around: Plenty of Republicans who had misgivings about Sanford came out to vote anyway.\u201d Sanford\u2019s oldest son Marshall and his now-fianc\u00e9e Maria Belen Chapur were standing beside the candidate at his victory celebration. \u201cShe flew a continent to be here last night. Whether I won or lost, she wanted to be here,\u201d Sanford said Wednesday mornign on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point.\u201d \u201cWe certainly appreciate her willing to do so, and I think as folks get to know her, I think they\u2019re going to love her.\u201d Sanford was in his second term as governor in 2009 when he disappeared from public view for several days. At the time his staff claimed he\u2019d been hiking the Appalachian Trail. He later admitted that he was actually in Argentina, seeing Chapur, with whom he was having an affair. The episode sank any hopes Sanford had of making a bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Sanford and wife Jenny were divorced in 2010. He finished his second term as governor in January 2011, after being censured and fined tens of thousands of dollars for ethics violations, exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity. But he came back, beating out 15 other candidates earlier this year to win the Republican nomination in the race for the vacant House seat. From the start, Sanford was very open about the affair on the campaign trail and made it the subject of his first TV ad. And even with all his political baggage, he was considered the favorite in the race until last month, when court documents revealed his ex-wife had filed complaints against Sanford for trespassing on her property. Sanford told CNN that he didn\u2019t want to leave his sons home alone while their mother was away. He\u2019s scheduled for a court appearance two days after the election. Not long after the trespassing story broke, the National Republican Congressional Committee announced it was pulling out of the race and national Democratic groups announced they were throwing more money into the contest. And National Democratic groups jumped in. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and independent pro-Democrat House Majority PAC combined dished out nearly $1 million to defeat Sanford. The two groups, as well as Colbert Busch, highlighted the affair. At their only general election debate, Colbert Busch brought up Sanford\u2019s 2009 secret trip to Argentina to see his mistress. \u201cWhen we talk about fiscal spending and we talk about protecting the taxpayers, it doesn\u2019t mean you take that money we saved and leave the country for a personal purpose,\u201d she said sternly, looking directly at her opponent on stage. In South Carolina politics, two very different campaign styles And her campaign went up with a TV commercial which slammed Sanford for using \u201ctax dollars to visit his mistress in Argentina, disappeared for a week leaving no one in charge, betrayed all who trusted him, then lied to cover it up. Mark Sanford, it\u2019s a question of character.\u201d The DCCC and House Majority PAC have also spotlighted the affair in their final ads. \u201cI used to be for Mark Sanford, but not any more. He skipped town to be with his mistress on Father\u2019s Day. Sanford even asked his wife for permission to have the affair,\u201d said Mt. Pleasant Republican voter Jennifer Stark in the House Majority PAC commercial. But over the past month, another woman also entered the campaign spotlight: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Sanford and his campaign repeatedly tried to tie Colbert Busch to Pelosi, saying that a vote for Colbert Busch would also be a vote for Pelosi, who has high negatives with Republican voters and who most likely would become House speaker again if the Democrats run the table and regain control of the chamber in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Opinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace \u201cI\u2019ve fought hard over the years to make South Carolina a better place to call home. But those efforts pale now against the larger battle for the direction of our country. Maybe that\u2019s why Nancy Pelosi and allies have spent more than a million dollars to defeat me. But this contest is bigger than them or me, it\u2019s about two different visions of how we restore America and reign in Washington spending,\u201d Sanford said, looking into the camera in a TV spot that started running district-wide last week. Two weeks ago he even debated a cardboard cutout of Pelosi to call out Colbert Busch for not accepting more than one debate. Sanford also repeatedly brought up the money that national Democratic groups have poured into the South Carolina race. \u201cWhat it says is, whose voice do you carry when you go to Washington D.C.?\u201d he said in the debate with Colbert Busch, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that national Democratic groups have spent on the race. Colbert Busch, responding to the Sanford criticism, sought to distance herself from Washington and from national Democrats. \u201cNo one tells me what to do except the people of South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District. So a victory for Elizabeth Colbert Busch is a victory for the people of South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District,\u201d she told CNN Monday, adding that two-thirds of her contributions have come from within the Palmetto State. While Sanford touted his fiscal conservative record, Colbert Bush campaigned as an independent centrist who would buck President Barack Obama. In her CNN interview, she highlighted where she doesn\u2019t see eye to eye with the president. \u201cI respectfully disagree with his budget,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cwe need to vote to repair\u201d the president\u2019s health care law. Even though they didn\u2019t support Sanford, the NRCC congratulated him Tuesday night, and said the results could prove troublesome for House Democrats in 2014. \u201cDemocrats spent more than $1 million trying to elect a candidate who was backed by the Democrat machine, but at the end of the day, running on the Obama-Pelosi ticket was just too toxic for Elizabeth Colbert Busch,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden, NRCC chairman, said in a statement. But national Democrats see a silver lining in Colbert Busch\u2019s defeat. \u201cHouse Republicans\u2019 outreach to women voters now has Mark Sanford as the face. Republicans now have to defend him and stand with him until Election Day,\u201d Rep. Steve Israel, DCCC chairman, said in a statement. \u201cIn this deep red Republican district that Mitt Romney won by 18 points, the fact that the Democrat made this competitive is a testament to the strength of Elizabeth Colbert Busch as a candidate and the Republican habit of nominating flawed candidates.\u201d Sanford has a woman problem The congressional seat became vacant when Rep. Tim Scott, who won re-election by 27 percentage points last November, was picked by GOP Gov. Nikki Haley to fill the Senate seat of Sen. Jim DeMint, who stepped down late last year to take over as the head of the conservative Heritage Foundation. No Democrat has held the seat in more than 30 years, and that streak still stands.",

            "article_content": "Half of states will expand Medicaid under Obamacare; half refuse or are on the fence Low-income citizens and their advocates say Medicaid expansion necessary States like Texas, Florida say a Medicaid expansion is costly and will fail Politics at play and most states will eventually expand the program, political experts say Bettina Cox battled cervical cancer in 2012. A year later, the Texas native feels that narrowly qualifying for a Medicaid-sponsored program for low-income and uninsured female cancer patients saved her life. She now wants her governor and state legislature to support an expansion of Medicaid \u2013 part of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2013 that she feels could save the lives of thousands of other women in her state by helping them detect diseases much earlier. But if Texas lawmakers have their way \u2013 as well as governors and legislatures in Florida, South Carolina and nearly a dozen other states \u2013 low-income Americans like Cox may not have expanded access to funds needed for such procedures. Those states feel the expansion is an unnecessary government overreach at a time when spending should be limited, not expanded. Still, for some, the impact on their lives is very real. Government reverses plan to cut Medicare Advantage rate \u201cIf I had Medicaid expansion, I would have found a doctor sooner than later,\u201d said Cox. At 60, she was too young to qualify for Medicare and said she was also told she didn\u2019t qualify for traditional Medicaid treatment available to women of childbearing age. \u201cAs soon as I felt ill, I would have gone to go check.\u201d \u201cIf I had Medicaid expansion, I would have found a doctor sooner than later\u201d Bettina Cox, cancer survivor Instead, Cox said, her tumor went unchecked for months, growing to the size of a grapefruit. Eventually an oncologist, working largely on a pro bono basis, properly diagnosed Cox as having stage 1 cervical cancer and helped her find health coverage under a Medicaid provision mandating treatment for women with breast and cervical cancer. The catch: The program was only available to women who weren\u2019t already covered by insurance or Medicaid. \u201cIt saved my life, it actually saved my life,\u201d Cox said of the treatment she received. Political rising stars in Texas, like their counterparts in nearly half the country, are drawing partisan battle lines over extending federally subsidized health care to more than a million of the state\u2019s poorest residents. This week, a Texas showdown pitted Gov. Rick Perry against Democratic Party favorites the Castro brothers \u2013 U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro and San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro \u2013 in dueling press conferences on expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI\u2019m a self-employed artist and the mother of a 3-year-old and I\u2019m not eligible to receive Medicaid. Private health insurance is not an option,\u201d Melissa Knight, who spoke at the Castro rally, said later. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are working really hard. They aren\u2019t being lazy, they just don\u2019t have the means for extra insurance. It\u2019s about trying to provide for your family.\u201d Premiums could rise under Obamacare Partisan divide on health care remains The faceoff was equal parts an ideological fight over the merits of Obamacare and a foreshadowing of how that policy will influence high-stakes political races. \u201cMedicaid expansion is a misguided, and ultimately doomed, attempt to mask the shortcomings of Obamacare,\u201d said Perry, a former Republican presidential candidate who is thought to be considering another run for the White House in 2016. \u201cIt would benefit no one in our state to see their taxes skyrocket and our economy crushed as our budget crumbled under the weight of oppressive Medicaid costs.\u201d \u201cGovernor, being tough on people with no health insurance won\u2019t win you the Republican presidential primary in 2016,\u201d Joaquin Castro wrote in a Dallas Morning News op-ed. \u201cIt definitely won\u2019t win you the presidency.\u201d Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a Democrat, unleashed a similarly blistering critique of his Republican counterpart in South Carolina, Nikki Haley, in remarks to a Democratic Party conference in Charleston last month. O\u2019Malley attacked Haley, who is up for re-election next year, as a \u201ctea party Republican\u201d who cares more about voter ID laws than expanding health care access and education for South Carolina. Then there\u2019s the plight of politicians like Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, who endorsed expanding Medicaid in his state using federal dollars in Florida, only to be met with opposition by fellow Republicans in the Sunshine State\u2019s legislature. Scott, who campaigned heavily against Obama\u2019s health care law in 2010, said he would accept the federal dollars last month, but his state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature has since opposed the move. \u201cIt\u2019s creating the same type of tensions among many conservatives that are taking place at the national level, at state level,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor.  \u201cYou have a lot of governors who have national aspirations and have a huge incentive not to reject those funds. \u2026 Then there are conservative legislators who have no national aspirations who are sticking to their position.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last year that states can opt out of broadening Medicaid coverage, striking down one of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Since then, about half of the states have said they\u2019ll opt in to expanded Medicaid. Nearly a quarter say they won\u2019t participate, with the remaining quarter still on the fence, according to figures from the Advisory Board Company, a policy consulting firm. \u201cThings got much more complicated,\u201d Don Berwick, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said of the Supreme Court ruling. \u201cThere are now many more options where states can customize. \u2026 In states where they are more politically ambivalent, it becomes more complicated.\u201d \u201cMedicaid expansion is a misguided, and ultimately doomed, attempt to mask the shortcomings of Obamacare\u201d Texas Gov. Rick Perry Republican governors in at least eight states have agreed to Medicaid expansion, which would extend coverage to all adults with income below 138% of the poverty line. It\u2019s part of the Obama administration\u2019s push for universal insurance, and the federal government is dangling a big carrot to make it happen. It will cover each state\u2019s expansion costs in full for the first three years. After that, states will be responsible for no more than 10% of the tab. Some of the states that have decided to opt out have some of the highest uninsured rates in the nation. Take, for example, Texas, where nearly a quarter of the residents are uninsured. Some 1.75 million adults would be newly eligible if the state joins in. It stands to gain $25.3 billion in federal funds over four years to insure poor adults, while spending $1.3 billion, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an advocacy group for low-income Texans. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission said Medicaid expansion would prove costly to the tune of \u201ctens of billions in combined state and federal funds over the next 10 years.\u201d Still, in the end, the pushback against expansion may amount to just that, political experts said. \u201cIf you\u2019re betting, you bet that in the end they\u2019re going to take the money. The states need money and this would cover a large amount of people,\u201d Zelizer said, adding that the holdouts will face mounting opposition both within and outside of their party. \u201cPart of it will come from moderate Republicans who don\u2019t want to have a party painted as extremists. Part of it will come from needs of the electorate because there is a great need.\u201d People like Cox and Knight say lawmakers had better pay heed to that need. \u201cI feel frustrated because as a citizen because I don\u2019t feel supported by my leaders,\u201d Knight said.

            "article_content": "White House task force meeting was disappointing, the NRA says Movies don't cause violence, the former head of movie industry group tells CNN Many groups are pushing for universal background checks, Vice President Joe Biden says Many also support taking action on high-capacity magazines, he says A federal task force looking for ways to curb gun violence will have a set of recommendations by Tuesday, Vice President Joe Biden announced Thursday. Speaking during a week of meetings with disparate groups on various sides of the issue \u2013 including some for and others against stricter gun controls \u2013 Biden, who oversees the task force, said the recommendations to be given to President Barack Obama will serve as a beginning. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean it is the end of the discussion, but the public wants us to act,\u201d he told reporters. A look at U.S. gun laws Obama called for the task force after last month\u2019s massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 27 people were killed \u2013 20 of them elementary school children. Biden said he\u2019s been surprised by how many groups have encouraged universal background checks for all gun owners, including those who purchase through private sales. Biden reveals mutual gun policy findings Biden to suggest background check change Mark Kelly: I'd like to talk to the NRA Chicago's top cop wants new gun law Some states have backlogs of thousands of felons who are never registered on lists aimed at helping prevent dangerous weapons from getting into their hands, he noted. CNN iReport: The gun control debate The National Rifle Association said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with a White House task force meeting Thursday, saying it expected mental health, the \u201cmarketing of violence to our kids\u201d and school safety to be top topics. \u201cWe were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cWhile claiming that no policy proposals would be prejudged, this task force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners \u2013 honest, taxpaying, hardworking Americans.\u201d The group indicated it will now concentrate its efforts through members of Congress. NRA President David Keene told CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d that little common ground was found. An exception was a possible agreement to place \u201cpotentially violent\u201d mentally ill people on a national database of those not allowed to buy firearms, Keene said. Share your recommendations on Twitter Biden called it a complicated issue, emphasizing that there is \u201cno singular solution to how we deal with\u201d mass shootings. Many stakeholders in the issue have met with members of the task force, Biden said, including medical and religious groups, educators and parents. Concerns about mental health may be \u201cone of the most important things that we\u2019ve been focusing on,\u201d he said. Biden also noted that many firearm deaths in the United States are suicides. Referring to one of the most contentious issues \u2013 whether to reinstate an assault weapons ban \u2013 Biden said he has never heard so much support for \u201cthe need to do something about high-capacity magazines.\u201d Former Marines share dramatically different stances on gun violence The task force also was meeting with members of the entertainment industry to discuss violence in movies and TV shows. Obama has spoken out about a culture that often \u201cglorifies guns and violence.\u201d Dan Glickman, a former congressman and onetime head of the Motion Picture Association of America, rejects suggestions of links between films and real-life violence. \u201cI don\u2019t think the abundance of movies that are put out by the entertainment industry are that violent or cause violence,\u201d he told CNN on Thursday. Opinion: Three areas where Biden and NRA can find common ground Also, Glickman said, \u201cHollywood does a pretty good job of letting parents know through its ratings system what kind of movie is coming out \u2013 whether there\u2019s violence or sexual conduct or other kinds of things.\u201d Glickman was a U.S. representative from Kansas for nine terms but lost a re-election bid in 1994. He blames that loss partly on supporting an assault weapons ban. \u201cI would vote for it again and thought it was the right thing to do,\u201d he said Thursday.  He called it \u201ca very politically sensitive issue,\u201d particularly among law-abiding  gun owners who see it as a threat to their ownership of guns. Biden said Wednesday that while legislative action is needed to prevent mass shootings, Obama is also exploring executive orders. Keene, the NRA president, told CNN that \u201csome things you can do by executive orders, some things you can\u2019t do by executive orders. Some things you do by executive orders need money to be implemented, and that\u2019s up to Congress.\u201d Wal-Mart, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Bass Pro Shops were among 10 retailers who were to meet Thursday with Attorney General Eric Holder, who is part of the panel. Wal-Mart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, triggered controversy earlier in the week when it said its officials were unavailable to attend the meeting because of scheduling. The company soon reversed its decision, saying it had \u201cunderestimated the expectation to attend.\u201d The NRA has argued that it is committed to keeping people protected, but that a focus on stricter gun control is misguided. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre has called for all U.S. schools to have armed guards. Keene later told CNN the group supports schools choosing whether they want armed guards.

            "article_content": "Obama and Boehner entered fiscal cliff negotiations working on \"grand bargain\" What ended up being passed was scaled back and far from grandiose The biggest deterrent from going big on legislation is consequences of next election \"The most influential outside groups on both sides are not fans of compromise,\" expert says It was a common refrain during the House and Senate late-night votes to avert the fiscal cliff. Senator after senator, congressman after congressman lamented the fact that the legislation didn\u2019t \u201cdo more,\u201d \u201cgo bigger\u201d or that it was \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d Political watchers believed the fiscal cliff negotiations were the perfect time for President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner to hatch a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d \u2013 a deal that would have included both large increases in tax revenue and major cuts in government spending. At the time, both men looked better positioned to deliver a bipartisan plan. Boehner seemed to have a firmer hand on his caucus leading up to the talks, and the president was coming off a hard-fought re-election win. Those hopes, however, proved empty. What passed both the House and Senate was noticeably scaled back and far from grandiose. This is not the first time a grand bargain has fallen apart. Obama and Boehner worked together in an effort to negotiate a path toward fiscal health in 2011 \u2013 another so-called \u201cgrand bargain\u201d \u2013 but the efforts ultimately ended in acrimony. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin, Boehner described it as his \u201cgreatest disappointment.\u201d With two grand bargain failures between the president and the speaker, is it really possible for Congress to go big and pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation as the nation approaches hitting its debt ceiling? Members of Congress and political watchers alike say the prospect seems bleak. A combination of lawmakers lacking courage, the threat of primary challenges and nobody wanting to put skin in the game makes it incredibly difficult to get a big, bipartisan deal done. According to Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of The Rothenberg Political Report, the biggest deterrent to \u201cgoing big\u201d is the next election. New Congress tackles old leftovers \u201cWith anything big, members will get a lot of what they like and also a lot that they don\u2019t like,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cAnd in the realm of political campaigns, which focuses on the negative, it is easy to put the negative parts of a bill into a campaign ad and get a lot of attention.\u201d The last few elections have proven this. Outside political groups have, in many situations, funded political hopefuls to challenge congressional incumbents. A whopping $293.5 million in outside money was spent in 2012 congressional races, according to the Federal Election Commission. In the 2010 congressional races, according to the FEC, $153 million was spent by outside groups, and 54 incumbents lost re-election, many of them Democrats. One difficult vote \u201cdoesn\u2019t create primary defeat, but it could cause an outside group to get involved, to put the financial backing behind a challenger and all of a sudden make the member\u2019s electoral life more miserable,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cThis is a fairly new phenomenon. The kind of immediacy with which someone can come out of nowhere, be funded by an outside group and get to a high stage is much quicker than before.\u201d Doubt in getting a grand bargain done is not limited to those on the outside, though. Retiring Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio, agreed that a grand bargain agreement is not doable. \u201cNo one has the courage to go big because when you go big you are going to make some people mad,\u201d LaTourette said shortly before Tuesday night\u2019s vote to avert the fiscal cliff. \u201cIf I was a Democrat, once you start to go big, the AARP, AFL-CIO is going to come after you, and when you are a Republican, the tax people come after you.\u201d New faces on Capitol Hill LaTourette has a history with trying to go big. He was the key Republican advocate for the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction and budget plan, which ultimately failed in the House. He even proposed bringing the plan to the floor at a Republican conference meeting Tuesday afternoon. Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Indiana, knows this all too well. Indiana Republican voters kicked Lugar out of office in the party primary in May after 36 years in the Senate. Richard Mourdock, a longtime GOP operative, benefited from manpower and money from tea party activists and outside groups determined to topple the six-term veteran. Lugar was attacked over questions about whether he even lived in Indiana, for his seniority and for his penchant for bipartisanship. The Club for Growth, a conservative pro-growth group, perhaps played the biggest role, releasing a barrage of ads that framed Lugar as out of step with his own party. The group endorsed Mourdock in mid-February and spent close to $1.5 million on television ads \u2013 close to what Lugar\u2019s own campaign spent on TV spots. But it also collected more than $300,000 from donors and gave it to the Mourdock campaign, making their total spending on the race close to $2 million. Debt debate starts now Lugar, who voted for Obama\u2019s economic stimulus package and the bank and financial institution bailout in 2008, proved that while one tough vote may not hurt you, a few put together can cause headaches. \u201cThe bottom line is a grand bargain or going big would require compromise and the most influential outside groups on both sides are not fans of compromise,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThose two factors are at odds with each other.\u201d Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, though hopeful that it is still possible, acknowledged that there are major impediments to big, bipartisan legislation. \u201cIf everybody can give a little bit, then you can get an agreement,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cThe whole idea behind that is shared responsibly. If everybody has got skin in the game, then you can do a large agreement.\u201d Opinion: Real issue is runaway spending CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senators approve a measure requiring them to donate 20% of their salaries to charity The House is expected to dump the Senate 2014 budget proposal; the Senate shot down the House's President Obama is  to present his budget proposal next month Senators voted for 13 hours until just before 5:00 a.m. The Democrat-controlled Senate passed its first formal budget proposal in four years early Saturday after hours of non-stop voting that started Friday evening. The non-binding plan for the 2014 budget calls for a trillion dollars in tax increases and passed 50 to 49. No Republicans voted for the bill, and four Democrats voted against it. It now goes to the House, where it is expected to be shot down.  Senators recently voted down a budget proposal passed by the Republican-controlled house. The two budget proposals and a third one to be offered by the president will likely be used as a basis for future negotiations between the parties. The Senate convened on Friday morning, and voting started about 4 p.m. ET, as lawmakers considered dozens of amendments to the Democratic budget proposal. Packages, budgets, and yoga pants, oh my! The \u201cvote-a-rama,\u201d as it\u2019s known on Capitol Hill, typically is an annual affair each budget season. However, because it\u2019s been so long since Democrats put a budget on the floor, almost half the current senators had not been through the demanding and exhaustive practice. It involves the consideration of and voting on dozens of amendments to the proposed bill. The process took 13 hours and ended just before 5:00 a.m. Saturday. GOP continues push for balanced budget As voting on final passage of the bill began, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the session \u201cone of the Senate\u2019s finest days in recent history.\u201d \u201cI commend everyone who has participated in this extraordinary debate,\u201d McConnell said. The proposal is supposed to set the funding levels for the various government agencies next year. But because those amounts were set already as part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling agreement, this year\u2019s budget is really a political document that outlines priorities for the Democrats who control the Senate. Authored by Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Washington, the proposal increases government spending \u2013 including repealing the automatic spending cuts required by sequestration \u2013 and raises taxes on the wealthy. While it reduces the deficit over 10 years, it stands in sharp contrast to the House budget proposal, written by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, that passed the House Wednesday. The Ryan plan slashes trillions of dollars from government accounts and balances the budget in just 10 years. In some years, the House and Senate budgets are reconciled, however, that is not expected to happen this year. \u201cThe budget we\u2019re debating this week puts our middle class families first,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt reflects our pro-growth, pro-middle class agenda that the American people went to the polls in support of just a few months ago.\u201d The top Republican on the Budget Committee disagreed. Congress avoids shutdown, bickers over 2014 budget \u201cOur chair says this is a pro-growth, pro-middle class budget. I say it\u2019s a pro-tax, pro-spend, pro-debt budget,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama. \u201cIt\u2019s a budget that comes nowhere near doing the things necessary to put America on a sound path.\u201d While Democratic leaders were confident the Senate bill would pass, there were several moderate Democrats, including some up for re-election, who were concerned about the steep tax hikes in it and indicated they might vote against it. In the end, Senators Max Baucus, D-Montana, Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Kay Hagan, D-North Carolina and Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas voted against the budget proposal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have lots of votes today,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warned Friday morning, going into the session. \u201cEverybody is going to be tired.\u201d Reid said 400 amendments had been filed, but he added that in most years only 25 to 35 are voted on during these extended voting sessions. Each vote takes about 15 minutes to complete. The amendments are not-binding but still symbolically significant. This time there were 70 votes for 101 amendments; some measures were agreed to unanimously en bloc after party leaders grouped the amendments together to cut down on time. Some of the amendments were designed to put a political squeeze on members of the opposite party. For instance, Murray offered up Ryan\u2019s budget for a vote, forcing Senate Republicans to say whether they are for or against the deep spending cuts and entitlement changes in his plan. Democrats argue the cuts are destructive and unrealistic. For his part, Sessions offered an amendment to require Democrats to present a budget that balances in 10 years \u2013 something Murray\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t do and President Obama\u2019s is not expected to do when he unveils it soon. Democrats and Republicans came together on one amendment that passed overwhelmingly. It would strip from the Affordable Health Care Act a tax on medical devices that has been unpopular since it was created. Other amendments dealt with a range of social and economic issues from raising or slashing taxes, preserving insurance coverage for contraception, hiring veterans, endorsing the Keystone XL pipeline, repealing \u201cObamacare,\u201d and prohibiting illegal immigrants from being eligible for Medicaid and Affordable Health Care Act benefits. Meat and poultry industry rescue federal workers The Keystone amendment, offered by Senators John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, and Max Baucus, D-Montana, passed by a vote of 62 to 37. Though non-binding, the measure establishes the Senate\u2019s official support of the controversial project, and is symbolically important as President Obama weighs his decision on whether to approve construction of the pipeline. He is expected to make a final decision sometime this summer. The Senate also passed \u2013 by a vote of 99 to 0 \u2013 an amendment put forth by Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, to end so-called \u201cToo Big To Fail\u201d financial advantages for megabanks, defined as any bank that has more that $500 billion in total assets. \u201cThis amendment is very simple. It says we should do away with the federal policies that create that subsidy, that uneven playing field,\u201d Vitter said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say it would forcibly break up the banks, it doesn\u2019t say we would tax them. It just says that.\u201d This year, senators had an extra personal incentive to pass a budget plan. That\u2019s because of a new \u201cno budget, no pay\u201d provision that says if a budget is not passed by April 15, senators\u2019 salaries will be held in escrow until a budget is approved. That threat is now off the table, though an amendment asking all Senators to donate 20 percent of their own salaries to a charity of their choice did pass by a voice vote. Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham offered the measure so that Senators \u201cwould feel what other people are feeling because of the sequestration.\u201d Lawmakers\u2019 salaries were not affected by the forced spending cuts that took effect on March 1, because the Constitution requires a new law to be passed in order to alter congressional compensation. Graham\u2019s amendment establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to broaden the effects of the spending cuts. FAA to close 149 regional airport control towers, spare 40 others",

            "article_content": "There was little drama in the four key races we were watching Tuesday night. But the off-year elections were viewed as much for what they would say about next year\u2019s midterm elections and the next presidential contest in three years. Here are five things we learned Tuesday night: 1. Christie\u2019s words and numbers make a case for 2016 Chris Christie has more than New Jersey on his mind. McAuliffe: I knew it would be close Christie: D.C. should tune into N.J. Was Christie's speech an announcement? Christie wins New Jersey governor's race In his re-election victory speech Tuesday night, the blunt-talking New Jersey governor who\u2019s seriously considering a bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination touted his bipartisan successes in the Garden State. \u201cI know tonight, a dispirited America, angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington, looks to New Jersey to say, \u2018Is what I think happening really happening? Are people really coming together? Are we really working, African-Americans and Hispanics, suburbanites and city dwellers, farmers and teachers? Are we really all working together?\u2019 \u201d Christie said. \u201cLet me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight: Under this government, our first job is to get the job done, and as long as I\u2019m governor, that job will always, always be finished,\u201d he told supporters at a victory gathering in Asbury Park. While much of Christie\u2019s speech was directed at a New Jersey audience, it may also have been meant as a message for the nation, two top Republicans said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an acceptance speech, that was an announcement speech,\u201d said CNN contributor Alex Castellanos, a veteran of numerous GOP campaigns. Exit polls: Christie, McAuliffe took different paths to victory \u201cI think it was an introductory speech,\u201d added former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the co-host of CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire.\u201d With Christie\u2019s re-election campaign seen as a tuneup or steppingstone for that probable White House bid, he needed a big victory over his little-known Democratic challenger, state Sen. Barbara Buono. And Christie came though, grabbing 60% of the vote, at last check. Another question heading into Election Day 2013 was how Christie would perform with voters who lean Democratic. CNN exit polls indicate Christie got 57% of the female vote. He won every age group except 18- to 29-year-olds, which he narrowly lost. He also won the Latino vote and took just over a fifth of the African-American vote, a much better performance than many Republicans in recent elections. As expected, 93% of Republicans voted for Christie, according to the exit polls. But he also won two-thirds of independents and just over three in 10 Democrats in a state where Democrats and independents made up nearly three-quarters of Tuesday\u2019s electorate. The exit polls appear to bolster Christie\u2019s case that he\u2019s among the most electable of the potential GOP White House hopefuls heading into 2016. McAuliffe narrowly wins Virginia Lessons for GOP in McAuliffe victory Dancing with the de Blasios Photos: Election Day 2013 2. Obamacare mattered Virginia was the first swing state to hold an election after the Affordable Care Act website\u2019s troublesome rollout, a controversy that has permeated national news coverage for weeks. Almost 30% of Virginia voters said health care was the most important issue in the race. While Democrat Terry McAuliffe narrowly beat out conservative Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, analysts credit a GOP focus on Obamacare for boosting Cuccinelli\u2019s vote total. \u201cThis is what kept this race close,\u201d CNN\u2019s John King said Wednesday on \u201cNew Day.\u201d Obamacare website getting better, official tells Senate panel Among all Virginia voters, 53% said they oppose the president\u2019s health care law, while 45% said they support it, according to CNN exit polls. A huge majority of those Obamacare opponents \u2013 80% \u2013 voted for Cuccinelli. Exit polls: Division over Obamacare Cuccinelli ran hard on the health care law in the final weeks, calling the election \u201ca referendum on Obamacare.\u201d After his narrow loss, Republicans said the outcome might have been different had the race lasted just a few more days. \u201cObamacare is toxic,\u201d said Brian Baker, president of the Ending Spending Action Fund, a conservative Super PAC that spent half a million dollars backing Cuccinelli. \u201cIf the shutdown had ended a week earlier, or the election had ended a week later, Cuccinelli would have won. This is a bad omen for Democrats in 2014.\u201d 3. Good news, bad news for the tea party in Alabama If there was any district that Dean Young could have won in 2013, it was Alabama\u2019s 1st District. The southern Alabama district is not only reliably Republican, but political handicappers list it as one of the most conservative in the country. Establishment beats tea party in Alabama runoff And Young is a conservative Republican who asked other Republican candidates to take an anti-same-sex marriage pledge, believes President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and said he wouldn\u2019t vote for his opponent in the general election should he win. But he still lost his primary runoff to the better-funded, more-establishment Bradley Byrne, a former state senator. In total, Byrne raised almost three times as much money as Young, with substantial donations from business community political action groups and individual business donors. That could signal the coming of a more active Republican business community. Already, the Chamber of Commerce has said it would be more involved in primary fights next year because of the negative effects of the partial government shutdown this year. The bad news for the tea party is obvious and twofold. In a very conservative district, a tea party candidate lost in a race widely seen as a precursor to more fights inside the GOP ahead of 2014 primary elections that will affect the makeup of Congress. What\u2019s more, an involved business community willing to throw its money behind candidates that won\u2019t shut down the government could be bad for the conservative movement. But the news isn\u2019t all bad for the tea party. Even though Young ran to the right of Byrne, groups that have backed tea party candidates largely ignored him during the race. Tea Party Express, Club for Growth and FreedomWorks \u2013 three of the largest national groups that have backed tea party candidates \u2013 all sat on the sidelines of the family feud. So, if you aren\u2019t involved, is it really a loss? 4. Time for change in New York Bill de Blasio\u2019s sizable victory was no surprise, and it was clear Tuesday night that the soon-to-be-mayor wants to shake things up in New York City. De Blasio wins NYC mayoral race \u201cToday you spoke out loudly \u2026 for a new direction for our city, united by a belief that our city should leave no New Yorker behind,\u201d he said in his victory speech, with his campaign sign on the podium shouting out \u201cPROGRESS\u201d in red and white. The towering figure with populist appeal stepped on stage to a raucous audience and the lyrics of a popular song, Lorde\u2019s \u201cRoyals.\u201d The tune is quite fitting for his campaign to combat inequality: \u201cWe\u2019ll never be royals. It don\u2019t run in our blood. That kind of lux just ain\u2019t for us.\u201d De Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than $500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten, and he wasn\u2019t shy in declaring his mission to level the playing field in New York. \u201cMake no mistake: The people of this city have chosen a progressive path, and tonight we set forth on it, together, as one city,\u201d he said. The first Democrat elected New York City mayor since 1989, de Blasio has painted himself as the herald of a new era in city government. His predecessors \u2013 Republican Rudy Giuliani and Republican-turned-independent Michael Bloomberg \u2013 were known for their tough-on-crime and big business reputations. 5 things about de Blasio De Blasio, the city\u2019s public advocate, has gone to no end to highlight his biracial family and portray himself as a man of the people and a unifier in the most diverse city in the country. The Democrat also spoke part of his speech in Spanish on Tuesday night and talked at length about his Italian background. Further showcasing his unusual-for-a-candidate style, he also hasn\u2019t been afraid to boast of his love for the Boston Red Sox on the campaign trail. Whether he actually raises taxes on the city\u2019s upper class as he promised is yet to be known, but after following two decades of only two mayors, he\u2019ll probably bring a different feel to the city. 5. Cuccinelli backers furious at GOP Cuccinelli was heavily outspent in Virginia by McAuliffe and Democratic outside groups like Planned Parenthood, NextGen Climate Action and Independence USA PAC, an anti-gun group funded by Bloomberg. The money wasn\u2019t the sole reason McAuliffe held a lead for most of the year: Cuccinelli was an unabashedly conservative candidate running in a swing state, his campaign made some strategic errors, and outside forces like the ethics scandal surrounding Gov. Bob McDonnell consumed the spring and summer news cycle. McAuliffe led the race in every poll since May, back when TV ad spending was mostly at parity. But the Democratic spending assault, especially after Labor Day, locked in the contours of the race. Heading into Election Day, Democrats had a roughly 4-1 spending edge over Republicans on the TV airwaves, and Republicans couldn\u2019t punch through. With Cuccinelli steadily trailing throughout the fall, it became harder and harder for him to raise money and enlist outside support. As the race came down to just 40,000 or so votes Tuesday night, Cuccinelli supporters in Richmond were livid that Republicans didn\u2019t do more to help. The Republican Governors Association spent about $8 million on the race, but stopped running television ads weeks ago. At the time, they pumped $1.7 million into a cakewalk of a governor\u2019s race in New Jersey \u2013 precious money that  could have boosted Cuccinelli down the stretch. The Republican National Committee spent $3 million in Virginia \u2013 a worthy commitment, $6 million less than it did in 2009. \u201cA number of people in the party establishment are going to need to take a hard look in the mirror and think about how they stranded their Republican nominee in Virginia, and with their help we would have had a Republican governor of Virginia,\u201d vented one Republican strategist close to the campaign. Indeed, Cuccinelli kept it surprisingly close in the end, losing by just two points even while running as an unabashed \u201cfirst principles\u201d conservative in a state dominated by an increasingly moderate electorate. \u201cThis guy ran and stuck to his guns and almost pulled it off,\u201d said Pete Snyder, a businessman and former Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. \u201cKen ran an unbelievable race, stuck to his principles. He had tons of drama in the party, and he was almost able to overcome that.\u201d Asked about the criticism from Cuccinelli supporters, RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said the party committee boosted get-out-the-vote efforts. \u201cThe RNC spent millions of dollars to fund the ground game efforts in both New Jersey and Virginia, working in coordination with both campaigns to identify and turn out voters,\u201d she said.
