            "article_content": "Marco McMillian returned to his hometown in the Mississippi Delta to run for mayor Before his campaign took off, he was killed, and rumors spread quickly Some called it a hate crime because McMillian was a black man and openly gay His family and friends believe McMillian found out unsavory things about Clarksdale Beaten. Dragged. Burned. The words leave attorney Daryl Parks\u2019 lips like a barrage of gunfire in the sanctuary of Chapel Hill Missionary Baptist Church, where people have gathered not for prayer but for answers. Some wear \u201cJustice for Marco\u201d T-shirts. They are enraged over the investigation into the death of Marco McMillian, a young black gay mayoral candidate, whose broken body was discovered dumped downhill from a Mississippi River levee on February 26. Parks\u2019 words suggest the most heinous of murders. Here in the Mississippi Delta, they conjure even more: a chilling history of racial hatred. Mississippi mayoral candidate found dead \u201cDon\u2019t stop; don\u2019t give up,\u201d Parks says. \u201cSomebody will explain the burn marks on his body. Somebody has to explain the torture he went through.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d responds the crowd gathered on this June day for an NAACP-sponsored town hall meeting on McMillian\u2019s death. It has been four months, Parks says. Four months, and the sheriff has not come to see McMillian\u2019s family. Four months, and he has not responded to a letter from McMillian\u2019s mother. Lawrence Reed, the key suspect, who is also black, is behind bars at the Coahoma County jail, awaiting a preliminary hearing early next month. The sheriff\u2019s department says it has the right man in custody. Beyond that, Sheriff Charles Jones has said little, and the dearth of information stokes suspicion in every corner of this city soundly divided by race and class. Rumors about McMillian\u2019s death spread faster than the Mississippi\u2019s water swells in the Delta. McMillian\u2019s mother, Patricia Unger, has heard them all. Some impugn her son\u2019s reputation. Some point to corruption and suggest he died because he knew too much. Unger and other family members are convinced there is more to McMillian\u2019s killing than the one man being blamed for it. And she lacks confidence that local authorities will solve the mystery surrounding the death of her only child. \u201cMarco was brutally murdered. That much we know,\u201d said Carter Womack, McMillian\u2019s godfather and spokesman for the family. Unger is hearing-impaired and does not feel comfortable speaking in public. \u201cWe have to raise the level of voices,\u201d Womack said. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s just another black man dead in Mississippi.\u201d An angel in a town possessed by the devil It was not long ago that McMillian returned to his hometown of Clarksdale and announced he was running for mayor. On paper, his platform was straightforward: reduce crime, improve educational opportunities and spur economic growth. That would have to be every politician\u2019s agenda in this bleak Delta city where the population of 18,000 is shrinking by the day. About 40% live below the poverty line, though that number doesn\u2019t even begin to convey the despair that hangs as heavy as the damp air. Many of Clarksdale\u2019s residents, weary of stagnation in their lives, believed McMillian was the right man for the job. He was one of their own, an angel who\u2019d come back to a town possessed by the devil. It was in Clarksdale, after all, at the crossroads of Highways 61 and 49, that music legend says blues man Robert Johnson sold his soul in exchange for unmatched guitar skills. But before McMillian\u2019s campaign even took off, he was dead. He had been missing for many hours when deputies discovered his body by a levee 20 miles west of town. They were tipped off by Reed, who was found alone in the wreckage of McMillian\u2019s SUV on the morning of February 26. Critically injured and taken to a Memphis hospital for treatment, Reed reportedly confessed to police that he had killed McMillian and told them where to find his body. Some here believe McMillian was killed because he discovered too much about his hometown. He was a black man who challenged the largely white establishment. \u201cI want to know why this isn\u2019t being called an assassination,\u201d said Darrell Gillespie, a former classmate of McMillian\u2019s. Parks, who stepped forward to represent McMillian\u2019s family and whose law firm represents Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents in Florida, fuels those theories. He says McMillian discovered information that had \u201csome components of public corruption. It\u2019s very serious.\u201d So serious that Parks says he is concerned about the family\u2019s welfare. Others believe McMillian and Reed were sexually involved, that the killing was domestic violence. Or, they say, Reed killed McMillian in a fit of rage after the latter made sexual advances. Reed is not gay, his friends said. Initial media reports implied that perhaps McMillian, described as Mississippi\u2019s first viable openly gay candidate, was killed because of his homosexuality in a state that has no hate crime laws to protect LGBT people. The story was made out to be a modern-day civil rights case. New York slaying considered hate crime One media report even drew a parallel between McMillian\u2019s killing and that of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old boy who was abducted, beaten and shot in 1955 after allegedly flirting with a white woman. His body was found in a river just a few miles south of Clarksdale and galvanized a then-fledgling civil rights movement. But to call McMillian a trailblazer as an openly gay candidate might be far-fetched. Many in the community did not know his sexual orientation; he hadn\u2019t made it an issue in the mayoral campaign, nor had any of his opponents. The sheriff\u2019s department charged Reed with McMillian\u2019s murder. Spokesman Will Rooker said there was no evidence to support allegations that it was a hate crime. Reed has not entered a plea. Still others in Clarksdale questioned why McMillian\u2019s death was even newsworthy. It was just another homicide in a town rife with violence. There were about 40 gun-related crimes just in April and May, the local newspaper reported. Drive-by shootings \u2013 even the killing of a 68-year-old grandmother \u2013 don\u2019t shock residents anymore. \u2018They are coming after me\u2019 Unger was in labor for nine hours before Marco was born at 2:11 p.m. April 23, 1979. He was an energetic baby with strong lungs. When her son was 6, Unger and her husband divorced, and she raised Marco by herself. He was a good kid who threw tantrums when he didn\u2019t get his way. \u201cIn other words,\u201d she said, \u201che was spoiled.\u201d People told her she was overprotective. She didn\u2019t care and catered to her son\u2019s every need. She served him breakfast in bed even after he was grown up. He was furiously curious about the world and loved to learn new things. He liked to skate and bowl with his friends and sang in the church choir. He also spent a chunk of his time around older people and emerged as a leader among his schoolmates. They remember a kid who helped mediate quarrels and stop fights. \u201cHe was the peacemaker,\u201d said LaSonya Wilson, 34, who knew McMillian from childhood. This story is not just about Marco but what Marco was about to uncover in Clarksdale. Angela Maddox He led the effort to integrate his high school\u2019s prom in 1997 and to find the money for the first senior trip (to New York and Washington) since the school was desegregated in the 1970s. Later, people noticed when he began to talk about bringing change to a town where a lot of black kids just wanted to escape. \u201cMarco dreamed about putting Clarksdale on the map,\u201d Wilson said. McMillian followed his dreams and made a career for himself, graduating from Jackson State University and then earning a master\u2019s degree in development and philanthropy from Saint Mary\u2019s University in Minnesota. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was impressive. He\u2019d served as the international executive director of the historically black Phi Beta Sigma fraternity and as an administrator at Jackson State and Alabama A&M. He moved to Memphis to work as a recruiter for New Leaders, an organization that trains school principals. In 2009, he received the Thurgood Marshall Prestige Award, and in 2004, Ebony magazine recognized him as one of the nation\u2019s top leaders under 30. He proudly showed off a photo of himself with a young Barack Obama. But McMillian was not without blemish. He was part of a payroll scandal that ousted Alabama A&M President Robert Jennings, who was found to have hired McMillian in an executive assistant job though he was not qualified and not even present for a few weeks while he was finishing his master\u2019s. McMillian also started his own consulting firm for nonprofit organizations, though its website provided little information. When a reporter from the Clarksdale Press Register covering the mayoral race inquired about McMillian\u2019s business, McMillian cut him off, saying he was not required to answer those questions. Some people who knew McMillian described him as the kind of person who got what he wanted and could come off as pushy and arrogant. \u201cHe never took \u2018no\u2019 for an answer,\u201d said Brad Fair, another Clarksdale mayoral candidate who\u2019d known McMillian since their school days. Fair remembers the day McMillian told him he intended to run for mayor after the incumbent, Henry Espy, decided four terms was enough. Fair was upset. McMillian had promised to support him. Now he was saying he would be his primary opponent. \u201cHe was definitely CEO-minded,\u201d Fair said. \u201cHe knew how to maneuver to get things he wanted. He knew how to work his way up to the top. He was so confident he was going to win (the mayoral race) \u2013 to the point where I began to think, \u2018Why am I even running?\u2019 \u201c In the end, Fair ran as an independent so as to not compete for votes against McMillian in the Democratic primary but lost in the general election. McMillian thought Fair needed more experience. Besides, he told Fair, he was on a mission from God. McMillian\u2019s mother could not understand why he chose to return to Clarksdale. She asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d Why would you want to give up a good salary, your standing in life, and move back to this place? she asked. His friends wondered the same thing. McMillian told them he felt compelled to do something to help improve the quality of life in his hometown. \u201cMoving Clarksdale Forward.\u201d That\u2019s what he chose as his campaign slogan. An official photo showed him standing in front of a cotton field. His friends knew he was ambitious. He dreamed of running for Congress one day. Fair believes McMillian may have discovered unsavory information about local politicians, whom some accuse of corruption and dysfunction in Clarksdale. \u201cMarco was too smart for his own good,\u201d Fair said. \u201cI am confident Marco knew the facts.\u201d Fair could not name any specifics but offered his city\u2019s despair as evidence. \u201cLook at our city. Look at how it\u2019s dying. Do we have corruption? Most definitely.\u201d What, if anything, McMillian knew might not be known until a trial, but some Clarksdale residents said they have been steadily losing trust in local government. Allegations of scandal that tainted Espy, the previous mayor, did not help. Espy, who first became mayor in 1989, was indicted \u2013 and later acquitted \u2013 on charges of conspiracy and making false statements in connection with a $75,000 bank loan to repay debts incurred in a campaign to win a congressional seat vacated by his brother Mike Espy. And Mike Espy resigned his post as agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration because of an investigation into gifts and favors from agribusiness firms. He, too, was later acquitted. Henry Espy\u2019s son, state Rep. Chuck Espy, was one of several candidates who ran against McMillian for mayor. Neither Espy responded to requests for an interview. McMillian\u2019s supporters have harsh words about Clarksdale\u2019s politicians, be they white or black. \u201cLocal government has failed us for the past 20 years,\u201d said Angela Maddox, another childhood friend who worked on McMillian\u2019s campaign. \u201cI think there are powerful people who are in hiding. \u201cThis story is not just about Marco,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what Marco was about to uncover in Clarksdale.\u201d Matt Killebrew, publisher of the Clarksdale Press Register, said he was not aware of any wrongdoing at City Hall. \u201cI think Marco was a bit defensive,\u201d he said, \u201cas any black candidate would be in the Mississippi Delta.\u201d Asked about allegations against local government, which are not hard to come by in Clarksdale, the man who just took office as mayor said he would look into them. \u201cIn terms of widespread corruption, I don\u2019t know that any exists,\u201d Bill Luckett said, \u201cbut I will investigate. Sometimes, the husband\u2019s the last one to know the wife is having an affair. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some rumors: that I had (McMillian) killed, (that) Chuck Espy had him killed. I just had to let my skin get thick and not even pay attention to things like that.\u201d But McMillian\u2019s supporters believe people who wield power in Clarksdale wanted McMillian to go away. In an interview with CNN, Maddox pulled out her cell phone and displayed text messages she said she received from McMillian just a few days before his death. CNN could not independently verify that the number on Maddox\u2019s phone, which showed up as \u201cMarco cell,\u201d belonged to McMillian. When asked about the number, Parks, the family attorney, said McMillian\u2019s \u201ccell phone is part of the criminal investigation.\u201d The texts suggest trouble. \u201cHelp me my dear love. Cause they are coming after me,\u201d he wrote on February 6. \u201cWho is coming after u?\u201d responded Maddox. \u201cThe White establishment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s being said? Maddox asked. \u201cTrying to buy me out of the race.\u201d Maddox said she told an investigator with the Coahoma County Sheriff\u2019s Department about the texts she received, but she said no one has asked to see her phone messages. McMillian\u2019s mother says her son had also warned her that something bad might happen to him. This is what she recalls he said: \u201cIf you get a call and they tell you I am missing, or that my body was found in the woods somewhere, do not be surprised. These people are out to get me out of the race. I am uncovering stuff they do not want people to know about.\u201d A fatal meeting About 10 p.m. February 25, McMillian told his mother, a special education teacher, and stepfather, Amos Unger, a custodian, that he was stepping outside to move the cars in the driveway. He was supposed to be driving the 70-plus miles north to Memphis in the morning. He had moved back to Clarksdale last fall and settled back into his childhood home on Lyon Avenue before announcing that he was running for mayor in January. But he commuted often to Tennessee for his job at New Leaders. About the same time, in another house just a few blocks away on Grant Place, Lawrence Reed also went out the front door, recalled his friend Kamilla Crump. Reed graduated from Broad Street High School in the nearby town of Shelby but moved to Clarksdale afterward. Crump met Reed through her husband, Deric, about four years ago. He worked at the Domino\u2019s Pizza around the corner on DeSoto Avenue. One night last year, when it was raining hard, the Crumps let Reed crash in their house. After that, they agreed Reed could live with them if he helped pay the bills. Kamilla Crump started calling Reed her older brother. \u201cHe is one of the best men I know,\u201d she said. The kind of person who was there for her and her family when they were in need. He\u2019d watched her little girl grow up; he was practically family. She described Reed using the same terms McMillian\u2019s friends used to describe the slain man: hard-working and a real go-getter. When Reed left the house, Crump thought nothing of it. It was late, but he\u2019d been home all day. Maybe he needed to go out and get some air. At McMillian\u2019s house, Amos Unger got out of bed about midnight and noticed his stepson was not at home. He thought it was odd; Marco always told his momma where he was going. It\u2019s not clear whether McMillian and Reed knew each other before that night. A friend of Reed\u2019s said the two were acquainted. McMillian\u2019s friends and family say, \u201cno.\u201d What happened between 10 p.m. February 25 and the arrest of Reed the next morning may not be known until a trial begins \u2013 or ever. But a friend of Reed\u2019s says she saw him just before his arrest. She spoke with CNN on the condition that she remain anonymous because she fears harassment. She offered these details. The friend said Reed showed up at her house on Highway 49 the morning of February 26. He was bruised and bloodied, she said, and driving McMillian\u2019s 2005 black Chevy Tahoe. According to the friend, Reed and McMillian planned to go to a party in the nearby town of Marks. Reed told his friend that McMillian had whiskey and marijuana on him. At some point, she said, McMillian drove Reed down a dark road and made sexual advances. \u201cMarco wanted to have sex. He started taking his clothes off. Lawrence is not gay,\u201d the friend said. A friend of McMillian\u2019s, LaSonya Wilson, also knew Reed. She\u2019d met him at the Kroger gas station where she worked and when he delivered pizzas at her house. She described Reed as a nice guy. \u201cI know this boy. He wasn\u2019t even Marco\u2019s type,\u201d she said, meaning McMillian associated with older, more established men, not a 22-year-old, a baby. McMillian\u2019s friends all knew he was gay, from the time he was a boy. \u201cHe always acted feminine. He was flamboyant,\u201d Wilson said. But McMillian grew up in conservative Mississippi, in an insulated African-American community. Being gay was taboo. McMillian\u2019s mother said she was not certain of her son\u2019s sexual orientation. \u201cIf I had actually known that he was gay, it would not have changed my love of feelings for him,\u201d she said. Reed\u2019s friend said Reed panicked when McMillian came on to him. \u201cI think the boy just snapped and went cuckoo.\u201d The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs issued a statement saying it had learned that Reed might use \u201cgay panic\u201d as his defense if and when he is tried. It\u2019s the same tactic that was used to defend the killers of Matthew Shepard, the University of Wyoming student who was tortured and killed near Laramie in 1998. The so-called gay-panic defense argues that a defendant\u2019s assault against an LGBT person should be excused or classified as a lesser charge because the revelation of a victim\u2019s sexual orientation caused the perpetrator to lose control and turn violent. In an effort to protect gay victims of heinous crimes, the American Bar Association is considering a resolution that urges governments to curtail the use of that defense. But that is how Reed\u2019s friend views what happened. When he showed up at her house, he told her he wanted to kill himself; he was already \u201cgoing to hell\u201d for having engaged in immoral acts. Then, he turned left out of her driveway, back onto Highway 49. She called 911 and told police what Reed had told her. CNN requested a copy of the transcript of the 911 call as well as Reed\u2019s arrest report and other documents pertaining to this case. The request is still pending. The sheriff did not respond to an interview request. Reed was driving south, toward the Tallahatchie County line, when he hit an oncoming car head-on. Deputies responded to the accident about 8:30 a.m. The driver of the other car, Chris Talley, was taken to a local hospital where deputies gave him shocking information, he told WMC-TV in Memphis: He learned there that Reed told a deputy that he had killed someone the night before and dumped the body. The alleged confession would also later be cited in an autopsy report. All that day, there was no word of McMillian. His mother texted people furiously, desperate to know her son\u2019s whereabouts. Deep inside, she feared the worst. Memories of Emmett Till The next morning, Scotty Meredith got a call from the chief sheriff\u2019s deputy in Coahoma County. Authorities had found a body and were waiting for Meredith, the county coroner, to come examine it before it was moved. Meredith had received countless such calls. He\u2019s no stranger to death. His first encounter came when he was only 12. His daddy died of lung cancer. He was curious about what was done to his father\u2019s body, and by the time he was 15, he\u2019d started working in the funeral business. Now he\u2019s 50, and a downtown funeral home bears his name. If it were my child, I\u2019d want it to be on the national news. But it is what it is. Scotty Meredith, Coahoma County coroner Clarksdale\u2019s high homicide rate keeps him busy. He\u2019s had to walk many a mother to the morgue. They tell him: \u201cYou know, Mr. Meredith, I don\u2019t have to worry about where my son\u2019s at anymore.\u201d Clarksdale is one of those towns where a lot of people know one another, but Meredith had never encountered McMillian. The first time he saw him was down from the earthen levee that ran between the unincorporated communities of Rena Lara and Sherard. Meredith parked his car and walked down the hilly pasture where fresh tire tracks had led deputies to a barbed-wire fence that keeps grazing horses and cows inside the levee board property line. Beyond it are thick trees and then the river. McMillian\u2019s body had been dragged under the fence. Meredith saw a naked man with a burn the size of a half-dollar on his left hand. He had a few blisters, cuts and bruises here and there, and his right eye was swollen. Meredith bagged McMillian\u2019s hands and feet to protect them in case they turned up evidence and put him in a body bag. He took out his cell phone and clicked a picture before sending the body away to Jackson for a state medical examiner to conduct an autopsy. Then, Meredith went to see Unger at her home. \u201cI told the sheriff that his mom needs to know about her son \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s 3 or 33.\u201d He took out his phone and showed Unger the photo. \u201cThat is my son,\u201d she told him. He did not believe that McMillian was beaten to death but thought he had been dragged from the car, maybe 20, 30, 40 yards. He told Unger it looked like it may have been difficult for one person to have done that. Unger felt frustrated. The sheriff had not come to the house. No one wanted to see McMillian\u2019s things, his laptop. Wasn\u2019t that a part of any murder investigation? Nor had anyone from the victim assistance office contacted her. Three days after the body was recovered, McMillian\u2019s family released a statement based on their interpretation of what Meredith had told them. They believed McMillian had been tortured before he was killed. They also believed Reed had not acted alone. McMillian weighed 220 pounds. Reed is a small guy. There was no way, they thought, that Reed could have done this by himself. \u201cWe feel this was not a random act of violence based on the condition of the body when it was found,\u201d they said. \u201cMarco, nor anyone, should have their lives end in this manner.\u201d By the time McMillian\u2019s funeral was held March 9, many news reports had cast the murder as a hate crime. The family suspected it was a conspiracy of sorts. An autopsy was performed the day after he was found, but it would take six weeks for its release. The National Black Justice Coalition, whose aim is to empower black LGBT people, said McMillian\u2019s death and the \u201congoing investigation highlighted the complexity of life for openly gay black men in Mississippi.\u201d McMillian\u2019s body lay in a blue casket, his face and body disfigured. The Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper said he resembled Emmett Till. The service was tearful. Unger felt faint after seeing her son\u2019s body and had to be helped to her seat. Civil rights activist and Georgia Rep. John Lewis told the crowd that Marco would live on through the good he had done his community. As days turned to weeks with no word from authorities, Unger\u2019s frustration turned to anger. Blacks die earlier from homicide,  heart disease Autopsy raises more questions Finally, on May 1, Mississippi Chief Medical Examiner Mark LeVaughn signed and released McMillian\u2019s autopsy report. The conclusion: He had died of asphyxiation. Multiple areas of blunt trauma to the head that are consistent with a beating most likely contributed to his death. It could not be determined whether he was burned before or after his death, but a chart showed burns on McMillian\u2019s calves, back, right arm and left hand. The abrasions on his knee were consistent with a \u201cdrag type\u201d injury. The report listed details about blood vessels bursting in McMillian\u2019s right eye and said he had bit his tongue. Everything suggested that McMillian had met with a grisly end. But the autopsy raised more questions. How did he choke to death? There were no marks around his neck. Meredith, the coroner, refused to sign the autopsy, the first time he\u2019d done that in 24 years on the job. He disagreed with its findings: What the medical examiner said didn\u2019t match what he had seen that day at the levee. He thought the autopsy made McMillian\u2019s injuries far more serious than what he observed. \u201cI am not comfortable putting my name on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my reputation.\u201d He said the family wants to believe it was a hate crime, that he was targeted because of race or sexual orientation. But in Meredith\u2019s mind, it wasn\u2019t. \u201cIf it were my child, I\u2019d want it to be on the national news. But it is what it is.\u201d The friend whom Reed visited after McMillian was killed also believes it was meeting between two men that went terribly wrong. She said Reed was trying to defend himself against rape, that there were two victims that night. \u201cEverything is not based on race,\u201d said the friend, who \u2013 like Reed \u2013 is black. \u201cI feel for his family, but we don\u2019t know what happened that night. None of us were there.\u201d Shortly after the autopsy was released, McMillian\u2019s family held a news conference and demanded a federal investigation. Unger wrote a letter to Eric Holder, the attorney general of the United States, asking him to look into the killing of her son. \u201cWhen you hear that a man has been beaten, dragged and burned, what\u2019s the first thing that comes to your mind, regardless of the fact that we are living in the 21st century?\u201d Unger wrote. \u201cEven though most newspapers are reporting the murder as an \u2018openly gay mayoral candidate found dead,\u2019 further investigation is needed.\u201d In her letter, Unger described her son\u2019s warnings that people were out to get him. The Justice Department has encouraged others in the community to send in their concerns. McMillian\u2019s death made national headlines. The media descended on Clarksdale to write about the murder of a gay black man in a backward Delta town, coverage that rankled some residents. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting a black eye because we\u2019re the Mississippi Delta,\u201d Meredith said. Through it all, the mayoral race continued with a runoff and an election on June 4. Luckett, the winner, agreed that his city was getting a bad rap. \u201cThe thinking is if you\u2019re black and you\u2019re gay and you\u2019re running for mayor, then some redneck is going to get you,\u201d he said, sitting inside the restaurant and music venue that he co-owns with actor Morgan Freeman, the Ground Zero Blues Club. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t killed because he was black. He wasn\u2019t killed because he was gay. It\u2019s just a tragic but bizarre set of facts,\u201d he said. Luckett, a millionaire lawyer and businessman, was born and raised in Clarksdale. He speaks with Southern swagger and draws an unmistakable silhouette with his thick, combed-back hair and portly frame. He takes great pride in showing off Ground Zero and the apartments for rent above it and believes that investments like that can help turn Clarksdale around from decay to renewal. Luckett made a run for governor of Mississippi \u2013 as a Democrat \u2013 and lost. McMillian\u2019s supporters said Luckett eyed the mayor\u2019s job so he could try again for governor with a feather in his cap \u2013  to be able to say that he was the one who turned things around in his hometown. McMillian, said his supporters, had momentum and had a real good chance of winning. Without him in the race, Luckett\u2019s victory was a landslide. \u2018Mississippi Goddam\u2019 Several speakers take the microphone at the town hall meeting inside Chapel Hill Missionary Baptist Church. They cry injustice and foul play and direct their venom at Charles Jones, the Coahoma County sheriff. \u201cThe sheriff not responding is about as offensive as you can be,\u201d says Parks, the McMillian family attorney who has left George Zimmerman\u2019s trial in Florida to be in Clarksdale on this day. The sheriff\u2019s name is the final one on the schedule of events. But he is not here. People look around the sanctuary. Sitting in the back is the only white person in the room, besides members of the media. It\u2019s Will Rooker, the sheriff\u2019s spokesman. He makes his way to the podium; all eyes follow him with the precision of an animal stalking its prey. Rooker looks nervous. He reads from a prepared statement. He says again that authorities have the right man in custody, that there is no evidence to indicate that this is a hate crime. \u201cThe Coahoma County Sheriff\u2019s Department is committed to building a case that\u2019s completely based on facts,\u201d Rooker says. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow ourselves to be influenced by gossip on social media.\u201d The disappointment is palpable, especially for Unger. She has not learned anything more about why or how her son was killed. She asks everyone to write to a Department of Justice representative who has come to Clarksdale for this meeting. She is convinced outside help is needed to solve Marco McMillian\u2019s murder. Toward the back of the church, one woman nods her head in agreement. Then, she whispers the title of singer Nina Simone\u2019s civil rights anthem. \u201cMississippi Goddam.\u201d Opinion: The Mississippi county where no one\u2019s gay Follow Moni Basu on Twitter",

            "article_content": "Six months after massacre, actions of one man still affect the lives of so many Town's soul embodied by five people: Rabbi, doctor, student, leader and victim's father Tragedy has changed them and altered their beliefs on guns, society, mental illness Click on each photo to hear them describe their feelings of loss and recovery The door to the shuttered mental hospital swings open onto a scene of decay: Chunks of fallen plaster and mold-infested insulation rest on the floor of a once magnificent room. Chandeliers have given way to crumbling ceilings. Walls are stained from rain running down the sides after two decades of neglect. Standing amid the ruins, it\u2019s hard not to think about Adam Lanza, our mental health system \u2013 and whether it failed him and the people of Newtown. The hilltop campus of Fairfield Hills, a former Connecticut state mental institution that closed in 1995 after more than 60 years, overlooks the community. To the left, about a half mile down Church Hill Road, stands the National Sports Shooting Foundation, a lobbying arm for the gun industry. To the right and around a few bends sits Sandy Hook Elementary School, the site of the horrific massacre of 26 people, including 20 children. It seems like the crossroads of tragic irony \u2013 a closed mental hospital, headquarters of a powerful gun group and the Sandy Hook school, all within about three miles and at the center of national debate. It\u2019s also home to Pat Llodra\u2019s office. Llodra is the Republican first selectman of Newtown, the equivalent of a town mayor; her office is in the former hospital\u2019s refurbished dining hall. The sprawling campus, which once housed as many as 5,000 patients, is a network of massive brick buildings. Some, like Llodra\u2019s office, have been remodeled and are used for a new purpose. Others are crumbling relics, a reminder of how the mentally ill were once housed in America. The irony isn\u2019t lost on Llodra, who was in her office at 9:35 a.m. on December 14 when she was notified through emergency dispatch of  \u201ca significant event at Sandy Hook school.\u201d Today, a teddy bear sits on a shelf in her office, next to a \u201cTown of Newtown\u201d commemorative plate and a Sandy Hook school baseball cap, adorned with a green ribbon to honor those who died. Before Sandy Hook, Llodra had once liked target shooting. The level of concentration it took to hit a target was exhilarating and rewarding. Now she\u2019s put gun control in her sights.  She feels compelled to speak out on behalf of her town and the victims of the massacre. And Llodra won\u2019t relent. \u201cThe way in which these children were lost was so horrific and so violent and so incomprehensible that even today \u2013 every day, it will strike me at some point that, \u2018Wow, this really happened.\u2019\u201d The 70-year-old grandmother has taken on lawmakers in Hartford and Washington about the need to curb assault weapons, and she\u2019s seen mixed results. The Connecticut General Assembly banned more than 100 types of military-style weapons and magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds of bullets. Congress, on the other hand, refused to act. Senators in April defeated a bipartisan measure that would have expanded background checks to gun shows and online sales. States tighten, loosen gun laws after Newtown Representatives from the nearby shooting foundation approached Llodra shortly after the massacre about what it believed might be common ground on gun control, but the meeting didn\u2019t last long. \u201cI\u2019m OK that they have their own agenda,\u201d Llodra says. \u201cI have mine, but I don\u2019t want to try to be persuaded that there\u2019s common ground, because there is not.\u201d Looking out for children has always been foremost in Llodra\u2019s life. As a young mother, she joined the PTA to be more active in her kids\u2019 schooling. She eventually became a teacher and then a principal, a powerful maternal figure dedicated to her students. Among her highest honors was being named a fellow for The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, a prestigious award to help further shape educators into national leaders. Upon retirement, the long-time Newtown resident figured she\u2019d give public service a whirl. She served two terms on the town\u2019s legislative council before running for the town\u2019s highest position. \u201cAnd here I am.\u201d One of seven children reared on a farm in Massachusetts, Llodra grew up around guns. But she has strayed from many in her party with her desire for expanded background checks and a ban on military-style weapons. As a lifelong educator, she always felt high-powered guns were too easily available, but \u201cthis event just galvanized that thinking for me.\u201d \u201cIf the horror of this event \u2013 seeing 20 innocent 6-year-olds be shot down by a crazed killer \u2013 if that isn\u2019t enough to change a legislator\u2019s heart and mind and do what is right and needed, then I don\u2019t know what could change that person.\u201d Treatment for the mentally ill is also part of her focus. Working in a closed mental hospital reinforces that. Society\u2019s failure to recognize how deeply disturbed Adam Lanza was, she says, is one more key component in preventing a mass shooting like this from happening again. \u201cIt\u2019s just my nature to try to understand why things are the way they are,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been woefully unsuccessful in making any meaning out of this at all. And part of that is I don\u2019t know what happened with Adam Lanza \u2013 why he turned into a person who was so hateful and had so much self-hatred. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it is, but we better figure it out. That\u2019s an obligation we have.\u201d Even with all the investigations, all the hearings on Capitol Hill and all the debate across the nation, one question looms over Newtown like a suppressive fog: Why? Remembering the Sandy Hook shooting victims Coming out of the cocoon I returned to Newtown to speak with those affected by what happened. I had covered the tragedy in the week after the shooting and wondered how the town of 28,000 was coping in its aftermath. I especially wanted to talk with gun owners about what it\u2019s like to bear arms in a place where gun violence left such a scar. Candles and tears: Portrait of a grieving town Walking the streets of Newtown, listening to residents and their stories, it became clear that what happened here is much larger than guns. It\u2019s a lesson of loss and recovery, and how the actions of one man still affect the lives of so many. I spoke with more than two dozen Newtowners who shared their thoughts, even their darkest moments, and met five residents who collectively embody the community\u2019s soul. A father wears a silver-plated belt buckle with a boy sitting beneath a mourning horse: \u201cJesse 2006-2012.\u201d A teenager rubs a bracelet with all the victims\u2019 names to find comfort. A doctor fights for medical research to study gun violence across America. A rabbi contemplates why society has become so barbaric. And Llodra tries to keep the town together. Newtown rabbi: We\u2019re not \u2018freaks\u2019 The tragedy has changed them all and altered their beliefs on guns, on society, on mental illness. Their sadness is profound, yet so is their resiliency. One symbol has emerged in town: the butterfly in honor of Dylan Hockley, a 6-year-old killed inside the school. Dylan had autism and, when he got happy, he flapped his arms like a butterfly. Just like a butterfly\u2019s metamorphosis, Newtowners are determined to transform the tragedy here into a form of action. Doing nothing would mean those 26 victims \u2013 those \u201c20 little angels,\u201d as they say, and their six adult protectors \u2013 died in vain. \u201cOur collective strength and resilience will serve as an example to the rest of the world,\u201d the high school principal told students upon their return to school. It has become a mantra repeated by residents and posted on signs around town. More than 60 organizations have formed here since the tragedy, from grass-roots activist groups to charities helping victims\u2019 families. The resilience of Newtowners keeps getting tested \u2013 by gun manufacturers, by the National Rifle Association, by lawmakers who balk at tightening gun laws. It\u2019s then that residents rely on their strength to keep pressing forward. Llodra says she wants Newtown to be \u201cremembered for being honorable in the struggle that we had since December 14 \u2013 that we were courageous, that we worked together, that we helped each other, that we recognized that we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d A sign on a window across from her office reads simply, \u201cWe are Sandy Hook. We choose love.\u201d \u2018Best friends and best buddies\u2019 Jesse Lewis burst into this world around 6:30 p.m. on June 30, 2006, weighing in at a hefty 11 pounds and stretching 23\u00bc inches. \u201cHappiest day of my life and the best day of my life,\u201d says Neil Heslin. The boy came to Heslin late in life. He was 44 and thought the days of ever becoming a father had passed him years before. Dad didn\u2019t cut the cord, but he was there for the delivery. He held Jesse right away and thought how his life was blessed. The bonds between father and son only grew. The two fished, hiked and rode horses together. By then, Heslin and Jesse\u2019s mother, Scarlett Lewis, had split. He lived with his mother at Wild Rose Farm, where Jesse was first put in a saddle at the age of 2. Newtown families share their stories Every moment Heslin spent with his son was precious. Jesse played soccer in a local league, but he mostly loved shooting hoops and throwing the football with his father. \u201cI don\u2019t really like playing on a team,\u201d Jesse would say. \u201cI just like playing with you, Dad.\u201d Other times, in those moments of father-son revelry, the two would hold each other and Jesse would confide: \u201cWe\u2019re best friends and best buddies!\u201d Every Father\u2019s Day, the two would attend a car show in a neighboring town. They\u2019d gawk at Model Ts and Studebakers and grab an ice cream cone from a restored Good Humor truck. \u201cHappy Daddy\u2019s Day,\u201d Jesse would say. Father and son were working to restore a 1948 Ford tractor. Jesse\u2019s plan was to have it ready for the Newtown Labor Day parade and throw candy from the back. At the tender age of 6, Jesse had become interested in politics during the November election. He couldn\u2019t pronounce the president\u2019s name: \u201cRock Bomber\u201d is what he would say. The two planned a trip to the nation\u2019s capital for spring so Jesse could learn more about the nation\u2019s history. On December 13, Jesse\u2019s mind was far from that trip to Washington. He was thinking of the gingerbread houses he was to make with his class the next day. Father and son stopped at the Big Y grocery store before they headed home. In the newsstand section, Jesse flipped through a gun magazine. That wasn\u2019t unusual. His father was a former marksman and taught Jesse how to shoot a BB gun, always standing over him and showing him proper shooting techniques. Searching the pages, Jesse stopped on one bearing images of three guns: a Glock handgun, a Sig Sauer handgun and a .223-caliber Bushmaster. The next day, Adam Lanza entered Sandy Hook armed with all three. Jesse asked his father about the guns. Heslin told him that Americans use the weapons for protection and carry the handguns in holsters. He told Jesse about the military-style rifle on the page, too. \u201cThey use them in the Army to kill with,\u201d Jesse said. \u201cYeah, pretty much, Jess,\u201d Heslin responded. Dad didn\u2019t think much about it at the time, but after the shooting he returned to the magazine rack and flipped to the page to \u201cmake sure what I remembered was true.\u201d Heslin later told that story to lawmakers in Washington as he campaigned for gun control. Heslin points to the side of his head and then his forehead, indicating the two bullets that struck Jesse. \u201cHis fatal shot was to his forehead and it exited the back of his head,\u201d he says. \u201cClearly he was standing face to face with Adam Lanza and clearly looked him in the face.\u201d Ten of Jesse\u2019s classmates survived; Jesse\u2019s last word, his father was told, was \u201cRun!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say it brings me comfort,\u201d Heslin says. The dad\u2019s monotone slows to almost a grunt: \u201cI hope Jesse\u2019s words did help save those children.\u201d \u201cI accept what happened. I don\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t change it. Of course, I wish it never happened. I wish I wasn\u2019t part of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI think more so than anything I\u2019m just disgusted. I\u2019m disgusted that I lost my little boy, disgusted that something like this happened, disgusted it could happen; disappointed that we as a society let something like this happen. \u201cI ask myself: \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Killer\u2019s house still standing What pushed Adam Lanza, 20, to the extreme may never be known, but clues lie somewhere behind the plywood that covers the front door of the spacious yellow colonial at 36 Yogananda Street. It\u2019s difficult to get a good glimpse of the home from the road because it sits so high on a hill on two acres of land. The home was last appraised at $523,620 in 2012. Dozens of similarly nice homes worth well over half a million dollars dot the neighborhood. With scenic views of the rolling hills of southern Connecticut, it\u2019s not where you would expect to find a boy who would become one of the nation\u2019s most notorious killers. It was in that home where authorities found more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition, at least 10 knives, three samurai swords and a slew of other weaponry. His mother, Nancy Lanza, was found shot through her forehead by a .22-caliber rifle left in her second-floor bedroom. Nearby was a blue-and-white duffel bag containing 50 rounds of rifle ammo, ear protection, eye protection, binoculars, paper targets and a certificate from the National Rifle Association bearing Adam Lanza\u2019s name. A gun safe and smashed computer equipment were discovered in the basement where Adam lived. Books found inside the home included two related to autism \u2013 \u201cLook Me In The Eye\u201d and \u201cBorn On a Blue Day\u201d \u2013 as well as one related to guns, \u201cNRA Guide to the Basics of Pistol Shooting.\u201d Newtowners hope the house will be torn down. At Colt, no apologies for arming America \u2018We have to do something\u2019 \u201cBooks heal hearts.\u201d That simple message greets visitors to the C.H. Booth Library along Main Street. Dozens of books, displayed atop pressed white tablecloths, line tables in the long entry. Among the titles: \u201cI Cry Alone,\u201d \u201cAs We Grieve\u201d and \u201cTear Soup.\u201d Sarah Clements, a 17-year-old junior at Newtown High, works at the library. In the weeks after the massacre, she took a phone call at the circulation desk. \u201cAre you the Newtown library?\u201d the man said. \u201cYes. Can I help you?\u201d \u201cDid the shooting actually happen at Sandy Hook elementary?\u201d the caller asked. Shaking, Sarah hung up. Her mother is a second-grade teacher at the school and was in the building that day. She attended third and fourth grades at Sandy Hook and had volunteered almost every day after classes to help her mother at the school. Since December 14, she has suffered panic attacks. Ordinary tasks have become labored. It\u2019s hard to concentrate during tests. Even walking into a classroom brings anxiety. And now somebody had the audacity to call and question if it was real? Sarah returned to the desk after a 20-minute break, still trembling. A woman approached and offered comfort. \u201cFor every one person that says that to you,\u201d the woman said, \u201cthere are hundreds of thousands of us that are standing behind you when you fall.\u201d The caller might\u2019ve caught Sarah off-guard, but he picked the wrong person. Standing up is what she does best. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want this to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cBut because of it, we have to do something.\u201d The teen has become an outspoken advocate as chairwoman of the junior chapter of the Newtown Action Alliance, one of the groups that emerged from the tragedy that is pushing to reduce gun violence through legislation and cultural change. Sarah urges teens to call lawmakers to get their voices heard, to \u201chelp move anger and sadness into good things.\u201d \u201cStudents should be at the core of this debate,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re the next generation. We\u2019re going to be living in the world that our legislators are creating for us. So I think we need to tell them directly that this is what we want to see: \u2018I want my town to be safer. I want my country to be safer.\u2019\u201d She helped send a group of Newtown youth to a New England conference sponsored by PeaceJam, a foundation working to shape young leaders with the help of Nobel Peace Prize winners. She is helping plan other events, including a summer symposium for teens from all over the nation to discuss reducing gun violence. Gun rights groups might have celebrated the defeat of universal background checks this spring, she says, but they had better be prepared for a long battle: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going anywhere, and just like the violence does not deter us, neither will these small \u2018defeats\u2019 in Washington.\u201d Sarah\u2019s arms are lined with bracelets honoring the 26 victims at Sandy Hook. Most are green and white, the school\u2019s colors. One was sent from a Virginia Tech student; another was from a group in Tucson, Arizona, that aims to spread messages of kindness. That\u2019s where former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was gravely wounded in a shooting spree that killed six. She used to wear fancier bracelets but has traded them in for this new fashion statement. \u201cThe fact I\u2019ve given up that part of me in honor of what happened is really meaningful to me. \u201cIt actually provides something for me to hold onto.\u201d In those moments when the pain is unbearable, she rubs one bracelet with the names of all 26 victims. \u201cIt\u2019s raised so I can, like, feel it,\u201d she says. \u201cI like rubbing it.\u201d \u201cThe coping is going to take a long time, and I think people are starting to realize that,\u201d she says. \u201cI like being at school because being in classes takes our minds off of things.\u201d The high school provided counselors in the days and weeks afterward. Therapy dogs were brought in, too. Students loved snuggling with them. They also found comfort in each other. \u201cIf you saw a person crying, you just walked up to them and hugged them.\u201d Principal Charles Dumais sent students, teachers and parents e-mails imploring them to not accept the tragedy as \u201cthe new normal,\u201d saying, \u201cWe will get through this and we will move forward.\u201d He ended the notes by telling people to close their eyes and think of a brighter future, a place that\u2019s safer. \u201cI felt like he was talking to me, saying, \u2018You have to do what you have to do to heal yourself, but also heal others.\u2019\u201d Sarah has kept the e-mails and reads them repeatedly to help her in her grief. \u201cFor high schoolers, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. It shattered our innocence and at the same time I think it opened our eyes to reality, even though on the opposite side, like,  \u2018How can that be reality?\u2019\u201d Beneath her wavy hair, her eyes appear weary, too many tears shed since December. Yet like so many others, she doesn\u2019t let the sadness crush her. She channels that energy to motivate others. In addition to her work with various groups, she has helped organize a program called Healing Through the Arts that links teens with younger children to draw, paint and create art. Even before the massacre, Sarah was an activist. She has served as the co-vice president of the high school\u2019s gay-straight alliance and the co-founder of the Creative Cultural Arts Council. Her message remains basic: People just need to be kinder. She knows firsthand the power of kindness. In the library where she received that disturbing phone call, Sarah found a surprise this spring amid the stacks. It was an envelope containing a green ribbon car magnet in honor of Sandy Hook student Ana Marquez-Greene. There was also a message inside: \u201cHave a good day.\u201d That simple act, she says, was a highlight of the days since the massacre. It inspired her to do \u201cthe same with one of my clubs\u201d \u2013 to look for ways to leave surprises for strangers, to put smiles on their faces. \u201cEverything that I do, I feel like I do it in honor of the people that passed away.\u201d Bill to withhold Newtown photos, records gets strong OK in Connecticut A marathon, not a sprint Dr. William Begg was in the emergency room of Danbury Hospital on December 14. He was told to expect multiple shooting victims from Sandy Hook, a school he knew well from living in Newtown the last two decades. But only a few people with minor wounds arrived. Most of the victims had been killed at close range by a Bushmaster, an assault rifle some people would like to see banned. The doctor had witnessed the extreme lethality of assault weapons since his first shift in an emergency room as a medical student in New York in 1987, when a store owner arrived at Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx with multiple gunshots. \u201cI still can vividly remember the horrible wounds on that store owner,\u201d Begg says. \u201cThat was my first introduction to gun violence.\u201d Yet he was young and preoccupied with earning a living. In the years that followed, he never spoke up about what he and his colleagues were witnessing in the emergency room: more and more patients coming in with horrific gunshot wounds. December 14 sparked him to action. \u201cI cannot sit back any longer and be part of the silent majority,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew from the time I was in the emergency room (on December 14) that I would absolutely try my best efforts to try to afford some type of legislative change.\u201d Begg helped form the United Physicians of Newtown, a group of more than 100 doctors who live or practice there. The group includes Republicans and Democrats, gun owners and non-gun owners. They\u2019re approaching gun violence from the standpoint of epidemiology, studying the causes and patterns behind diseases. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about 30,000 gun deaths a year,\u201d Begg says, \u201cthat\u2019s a public health issue.\u201d The group has several objectives: promote funding for research and education about firearms, create a national firearm injury database, promote better health services for the mentally ill, and enact stronger gun legislation \u2013 including universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons. The NRA, Begg says, has successfully lobbied to stop the government from compiling comprehensive gun violence data that he says most emergency room doctors would like to see. \u201cOur group is not for rescinding the Second Amendment right; we acknowledge the Second Amendment right,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to give our patients some evidence-based medicine to have them make an informed choice on what they think is best for themselves and their families. \u201cThe more data we have the better we can actually find some common ground.\u201d At Colt\u2019s Connecticut factory, no apologies for arming America Begg\u2019s group has lobbied the American College of Surgeons and other medical groups to join their call to study gun violence from an epidemiological standpoint. The American College of Surgeons reissued its stance in January in support of gun control. Begg appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in late February. He displayed graphic photos of gun wounds from emergency rooms \u2013 a sliced-open abdomen, a pierced skull, a shattered hand. At one point he showed a video of a bullet test-fired from a handgun into a foam-like block versus one fired from an AR-15 made by Bushmaster. The bullet from the AR-15, he noted, \u201cgoes in and basically explodes inside the body.\u201d GOP senators left before his question and answer session began. He said he would\u2019ve loved to debate them as to \u201cwhy our country allows civilians to own military-style weapons.\u201d An avid marathon runner, Begg says he is in this fight for the long haul. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be defined by defeat of the assault weapons bill,\u201d he says. \u201cChange will come. There is no doubt. Things don\u2019t happen all in one year.\u201d \u2018We\u2019ve become barbarians\u2019 Rabbi Shaul Praver buzzes guests in when they arrive at his synagogue, nestled along a winding New England road with a gorgeous view of a wetland. Before December 14, anyone could freely walk in. The rabbi helped lead the interfaith service attended by President Obama in the days after the massacre. He has since become a spiritual voice for many Newtowners. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any handbook on how to do it,\u201d he says. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t get anything in rabbinical school, saying, \u2018This is how you survive spree shootings.\u2019\u201d His congregation lost Noah Pozner, a rambunctious 6-year-old who was \u201csmart as a whip.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the worst and the best,\u201d Praver says. \u201cThe worst was the crime and the best was the reaction to that crime. And that has been really incredible: the love, the dedication and the strength.\u201d He has rallied clergy around the nation to lobby federal and state lawmakers for improved universal background checks and other gun control measures. He despises the National Rifle Association and its power to block gun control: \u201cWho are these guys?\u201d he says. Born in Long Island, Praver was headed to India at age 21 to study meditation and the violin. En route, he stopped in Israel and remained there for 10 years, getting trained at orthodox yeshivas. At 52, he\u2019s less conservative and more contemplative. He counsels his congregation by telling them that the heinous act of Adam Lanza doesn\u2019t mean God abandoned Newtown. \u201cOnce we have free will, people can act the way that they want to act,\u201d he says. \u201cThe world is a jungle and things happen in the jungle. It doesn\u2019t mean that there is no God or no providence.\u201d To him, the massacre is much larger than simply a gun-control issue; it\u2019s a sign of a society that has lost its way. \u201cWe have a surplus of information, but we have a deficit of meaning,\u201d he says. \u201cThe truth is we are starved of spirituality. By that, I mean basic happiness. \u2026 \u201cWe\u2019ve become gross in a sense. We\u2019ve become barbarians. We don\u2019t have enough of that delicate wisdom literature: How to be honorable in a society.\u201d The boogeyman with no name The makeshift memorials no longer line the streets of Newtown. More than 64,000 teddy bears were sent here in the days and weeks after the shooting spree. The stuffed animals, angel figurines and candles were put in storage almost as quickly as the satellite news trucks left. The items haunted kids on school buses as they looked out windows. Yet the scope of the tragedy remains omnipresent. Barricades still sit at the entrance to the Sandy Hook school. It will soon be torn down and a new school will be built on the property. Before December 14, the popular bumper sticker was \u201cNicer in Newtown.\u201d Cars now zip through town with green ribbons on their bumpers in solidarity with those slain. Young children still climb into their parents\u2019 beds, fearing the return of the boogeyman. Students and teachers at the temporary school for Sandy Hook survivors close doors gently. A loud slam could send them back to that awful day. Newtowners are apt to cry in public at the Big Y, the Newtown General Store or the Edmond Town Hall, where there is a $2 movie theater and gym. The tears come without warning. Strangers offer comfort by wrapping their arms around each other. It\u2019s called The Newtown Hug. Most residents cannot utter the name of the killer. Of the couple dozen people I met, only three referred to Adam Lanza by name. The high schooler, Sarah Clements, provided insight into that. \u201cBecause it\u2019s such an unspeakable thing to even describe it, we can\u2019t really describe that person,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think putting a name to that person adds, like, a human aspect that we don\u2019t understand and we can\u2019t figure out \u2013 and we won\u2019t ever.\u201d When the high school went into lockdown the morning of December 14, Sarah was in physics class. She and a friend crouched down and took cover. In the emergency room, Begg prepared for an onslaught of injuries. Llodra and Praver went to the firehouse near Sandy Hook. Praver helped with prayers. Llodra served as the town spokeswoman, addressing the media and offering comfort as families were told their loved ones were dead. People say Llodra was a calming presence amid parents who collapsed, cried and wailed. Llodra could relate. Three years before, her 42-year-old daughter died suddenly from a bacterial infection. \u201cIt just so rips your heart out that it\u2019s hard to recover from,\u201d she says. \u201cThe horrific circumstance that I had is multiplied by the circumstance of this event, because there was violence involved and because of the innocence, the age, involved of those sweet little babies.\u201d She attended 22 funerals or wakes of those slain. She missed four because of schedule conflicts. She has since met with President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy and other top leaders, along with the victims\u2019 families, first responders and countless Newtown residents. Amid the tragedy, she\u2019s had to continue managing the town\u2019s $111 million budget during a time of cutbacks, while dealing with the extraordinary. She has kept a close eye out for cracks that could split the town open, like alcoholism, suicide, divorce or depression. \u201cTo be sure, if we see any of that fracturing,\u201d she says, \u201cwe can immediately step in and help where people might feel very vulnerable. \u201cI understand that journey a little bit \u2013 that there are times in that grief when you\u2019re in such despair that bad choices sometimes are made.\u201d Newtown shooting details revealed in newly released documents \u2018Everything\u2019s going to be OK\u2019 Like Llodra and Praver, Neil Heslin went to the firehouse that day, too \u2013 but for the most agonizing of reasons. He learned shortly after midnight that his beloved boy, Jesse, had perished. \u201cI don\u2019t wish it upon anybody.\u201d Since then, he has traveled to Washington to speak on \u201cJesse\u2019s behalf without Jesse.\u201d He\u2019s met with the president and other top lawmakers about curbing gun violence. Heslin so wishes he and Jesse were taking their trip to the nation\u2019s capital together. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good about me speaking and testifying about my little boy.\u201d He has taken on the gun industry, accusing manufacturers of profiting from the Sandy Hook killings. As he has become more vocal, Heslin has received a few death threats from people he calls \u201ccowardly scumbags.\u201d With activism comes consequences. Gun rights advocates recently celebrated when the pro-gun group Connecticut Carry released court records on Heslin\u2019s past, showing arrests for driving under the influence in 2001 and 2002 and one for possession of narcotics in 2002. \u201cA felon with a long rap sheet of fraud, substance abuse and reckless behavior is the poster boy for background checks and gun bans,\u201d declared Connecticut Carry. That phrase was picked up and repeated on dozens of pro-gun sites. In early May, Heslin appeared before a Superior Court judge on charges from July 2011 of writing bad checks for his contracting business and driving with a suspended license. He has pleaded not guilty. Heslin says his troubled past is behind him. Praver has helped him with his grief and his spirituality since the massacre. What haunts Heslin now is that last morning he spent with his son, and how he\u2019ll never see him again. He and Jesse had eaten breakfast at the Misty Vale Deli. Jesse had ordered a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, his favorite. He only ate half. \u201cThat morning he was kind of quiet. I asked him if he felt OK; he said he felt fine.\u201d Father and son then drove to Sandy Hook. The two walked together into the school. Jesse hugged his dad, told him he loved him. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be OK, Dad.\u201d It was 9:04 a.m. Heslin missed Adam Lanza by 26 minutes. \u201cEven if it meant I lost my life,\u201d Heslin said, \u201cI wish I was there.\u201d Now he\u2019s on a mission \u2013 for his son who didn\u2019t deserve to die. \u201cI am Jesse\u2019s voice.\u201d",

            "article_content": "By Alicia W. Stewart, CNN (CNN) \u2013 Fifty years ago, Alabama Gov. George Wallace defiantly stood in front of the University of Alabama\u2019s Foster Auditorium to prevent black students from enrolling. The then newly elected governor had famously declared \u201csegregation now, segregation tomorrow,\u00a0 segregation forever\u201d in his inauguration speech. \u00a0His \u201cstand in the schoolhouse door\u201d brought him national attention. It took\u00a0\u00a0the National Guard, federal marshals and an attorney general to persuade the governor to allow Vivian Malone Jones and James Hood to enter. It was not the first time Americans saw the drama of the civil rights movement unfold before their eyes. Earlier that spring, images of police attacking peaceful civil rights demonstrators with dogs and fire hoses\u00a0in Birmingham, Alabama,\u00a0flashed across the evening news. \u00a0The previous year, riots were quelled with federal troops after the admission of James Meredith, the first black student at the University of Mississippi. Wallace later rescinded his views, but the incidents of the time prompted President John F. Kennedy to address the nation in a historic televised address about civil rights. \u201cNow the time has come for this nation to fulfill its promise,\u201d President Kennedy said in that address. \u2018The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.\u201d Read and see what he told the nation that evening: Read the full transcript\u00a0of his speech below: Good evening my fellow citizens: This afternoon, following a series of threats and defiant statements, the presence of Alabama National Guardsmen was required on the University of Alabama to carry out the final and unequivocal order of the United States District Court of the Northern District of Alabama. That order called for the admission of two clearly qualified young Alabama residents who happened to have been born Negro. That they were admitted peacefully on the campus is due in good measure to the conduct of the students of the University of Alabama, who met their responsibilities in a constructive way. I hope that every American, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incidents. This nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds. It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened. Today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free. And when Americans are sent to Vietnam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only. It ought to be possible, therefore, for American students of any color to attend any public institution they select without having to be backed up by troops. It ought to be possible for American consumers of any color to receive equal service in places of public accommodation, such as hotels and restaurants and theaters and retail stores, without being forced to resort to demonstrations in the street, and it ought to be possible for American citizens of any color to register to vote in a free election without interference or fear of reprisal. It ought to be possible, in short, for every American to enjoy the privileges of being American without regard to his race or his color. In short, every American ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated. But this is not the case. The Negro baby born in America today, regardless of the section of the nation in which he is born, has about one-half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same day, one-third as much chance of completing college, one-third as much chance of becoming a professional man, twice as much chance of becoming unemployed, about one-seventh as much chance of earning $10,000 a year, a life expectancy which is\u00a0seven years shorter, and the prospects of earning only half as much. This is not a sectional issue. Difficulties over segregation and discrimination exist in every city, in every state of the union, producing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threatens the public safety. Nor is this a partisan issue. In a time of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics. This is not even a legal or legislative issue alone. It is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets, and new laws are needed at every level, but law alone cannot make men see right. We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated. If an American, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public, if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote for the public officials who will represent him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place? Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay? One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression. And this nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free. We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettos, no master race except with respect to Negroes? Now the time has come for this nation to fulfill its promise. The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them. The fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city, North and South, where legal remedies are not at hand. Redress is sought in the streets, in demonstrations, parades, and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and threaten lives. We face, therefore, a moral crisis as a country and as a people. It cannot be met by repressive police action. It cannot be left to increased demonstrations in the streets. It cannot be quieted by token moves or talk. It is time to act in the Congress, in your state and local legislative body and, above all, in all of our daily lives. It is not enough to pin the blame on others, to say this is a problem of one section of the country or another, or deplore the fact that we face. A great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all. Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence. Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality. Next week I shall ask the Congress of the United States to act, to make a commitment it has not fully made in this century to the proposition that race has no place in American life or law. The federal judiciary has upheld that proposition in the conduct of its affairs, including the employment of federal personnel, the use of federal facilities, and the sale of federally financed housing. But there are other necessary measures which only the Congress can provide, and they must be provided at this session. The old code of equity law under which we live commands for every wrong a remedy, but in too many communities, in too many parts of the country, wrongs are inflicted on Negro citizens and there are no remedies at law. Unless the Congress acts, their only remedy is in the street. I am, therefore, asking the Congress to enact legislation giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public\u2013hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments. This seems to me to be an elementary right. Its denial is an arbitrary indignity that no American in 1963 should have to endure, but many do. I have recently met with scores of business leaders urging them to take voluntary action to end this discrimination and I have been encouraged by their response, and in the last\u00a0two weeks over 75 cities have seen progress made in desegregating these kinds of facilities. But many are unwilling to act alone, and for this reason, nationwide legislation is needed if we are to move this problem from the streets to the courts. I am also asking the Congress to authorize the federal government to participate more fully in lawsuits designed to end segregation in public education. We have succeeded in persuading many districts to desegregate voluntarily. Dozens have admitted Negroes without violence. Today a Negro is attending a state-supported institution in every one of our 50 states, but the pace is very slow. Too many Negro children entering segregated grade schools at the time of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u00a0nine years ago will enter segregated high schools this fall, having suffered a loss which can never be restored. The lack of an adequate education denies the Negro a chance to get a decent job. The orderly implementation of the Supreme Court decision, therefore, cannot be left solely to those who may not have the economic resources to carry the legal action or who may be subject to harassment. Other features will also be requested, including greater protection for the right to vote. But legislation, I repeat, cannot solve this problem alone. It must be solved in the homes of every American in every community across our country. In this respect I want to pay tribute to those citizens North and South who have been working in their communities to make life better for all. They are acting not out of a sense of legal duty but out of a sense of human decency. Like our soldiers and sailors in all parts of the world they are meeting freedom\u2019s challenge on the firing line, and I salute them for their honor and their courage. My fellow Americans, this is a problem which faces us all\u2013in every city of the North as well as the South. Today there are Negroes unemployed, two or three times as many compared to whites, inadequate in education, moving into the large cities, unable to find work, young people particularly out of work without hope, denied equal rights, denied the opportunity to eat at a restaurant or lunch counter or go to a movie theater, denied the right to a decent education, denied almost today the right to attend a state university even though qualified. It seems to me that these are matters which concern us all, not merely presidents or congressmen or governors, but every citizen of the United States. This is one country. It has become one country because all of us and all the people who came here had an equal chance to develop their talents. We cannot say to 10% of the population that you can\u2019t have that right; that your children cannot have the chance to develop whatever talents they have; that the only way that they are going to get their rights is to go into the streets and demonstrate. I think we owe them and we owe ourselves a better country than that. Therefore, I am asking for your help in making it easier for us to move ahead and to provide the kind of equality of treatment which we would want ourselves; to give a chance for every child to be educated to the limit of his talents. As I have said before, not every child has an equal talent or an equal ability or an equal motivation, but they should have an equal right to develop their talent and their ability and their motivation, to make something of themselves. We have a right to expect that the Negro community will be responsible, will uphold the law, but they have a right to expect that the law will be fair, that the Constitution will be color-blind, as Justice Harlan said at the turn of the century. This is what we are talking about and this is a matter which concerns this country and what it stands for, and in meeting it I ask the support of all our citizens. Thank you very much.",

            "article_content": "Waleed Ahmed gained fame in Norway for inventing an iPhone solar charger He also claimed to lead Barack Obama's re-election campaign in Norway Last summer, he approached Todd Weinberg with an investment Weinberg agreed to invest $1M to promote Justin Bieber's Scandinavian tour Waleed Ahmed grins for the camera, a sly smile on his face as he poses in front of a black Porsche parked on the street. At first glance, he looks like any other young guy hamming it up for an image to share with his buddies on Facebook. Yet looks can be deceiving. The Norwegian gained fame and fortune in his 20s \u2013 enough to own that shiny, black Porsche in the photo \u2013  after supposedly inventing an iPhone cover that uses solar energy to charge the phone. Norway\u2019s media dubbed him the \u201cMark Zuckerberg of Norway,\u201d and the government even posted a video on its website of Ahmed and his then-business partner meeting with Norway\u2019s minister of trade and industry to show off the solar iPhone case. Growing up Bieber 'Bieber Fever' strikes Norway Tardy Justin Bieber angers fans Why is Justin Bieber going bad? Ahmed\u2019s fame led to numerous encounters with international royalty and well-known diginitaries, including the crown prince and princess of Norway, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young and CNN founder Ted Turner. Ahmed apparently wasn\u2019t just an innovative genius: He said he had been selected to be the chairman of Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign in Norway. So, when Ahmed approached California investor Todd Weinberg last summer about his latest business proposition \u2013 managing Justin Bieber\u2019s 2013 Scandinavian tour \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like a stretch that the young genius could secure the rights to the pop star\u2019s multimillion-dollar tour. But the business deal between Ahmed and Weinberg would go terribly wrong. In the end, it would uncover a story that reads like the plot of a Hollywood movie. The Bieber ruse Last summer, Weinberg got a call from a friend in Los Angeles with connections in the entertainment industry about an amazing business opportunity. \u201cHe said that he had come across an opportunity \u2026 to help find money for an investor who could fill the gap for this tour that Justin Bieber is currently on,\u201d said Weinberg, a successful real estate investor and venture capitalist. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well I don\u2019t understand, how does that work?\u2019 \u201c That so-called investor was Ahmed, 22, who claimed he had already paid $4.5 million to Scooter Braun Management \u2013 Bieber\u2019s management company \u2013 for rights to the Scandinavian tour after the initial investor failed to come up with the money. But Ahmed said he needed another $1 million to secure the tour venues. \u201cWaleed wanted me to take the place of an investor who he had been working with that had fallen out of the deal,\u201d said Weinberg, 44. Ahmed explained in an e-mail to Weinberg that he had gotten involved in the Bieber project because he \u201chad the contacts to get a deal done with (Justin Bieber) because I am also working for President Obama as his election chair in Norway so easy to get things done.\u201d For his $1 million, Weinberg said Ahmed assured him and his contract promised, that the return on his investment could be as high as $10 million. Weinberg quickly went to work, trying to confirm the details. Is criticism of Justin Bieber fair? Bieber fever breaks in UK Justin Bieber's monkey seized in Germany Man threatens to blow up Bieber concert \u201cWhen we started looking and digging into the numbers, and (into) the spreadsheets and looking at actual ticket sales, per ticket sales, how many venues and how many tickets are being sold, it started to make sense,\u201d he said. Even though it seemed like a sound investment, Weinberg admitted he was skeptical. \u201cWhen I was presented with my offer, my initial inclination was \u2018No thank you, not interested,\u2019 \u201d Weinberg said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me, I have never done anything like this before. This is not my background. This is not my wheelhouse.\u201d The contracts and other documents Ahmed provided to Weinberg all looked real. To make it appear legitimate, Ahmed even set up a conference call with a key member of Scooter Braun Management. But Weinberg wanted to meet with Ahmed in person before moving forward with the deal. Just four days after hearing about the Bieber opportunity, Weinberg headed to Burbank, California, where the young entrepreneur introduced Weinberg to the team he had assembled to promote Bieber\u2019s 2013 Scandinavian tour. Even Miss Finland 2011, Pia Pikarinen, had been recruited to help promote the concerts. Ahmed looked the part of a deal maker. \u201cHe was Prada and Gucci from head to toe,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cHe was a nice guy, but he also had a bit of an edge and arrogance about him.\u201d It all looked like a good deal for everyone, and later that day, Weinberg and the rest of the team signed a contract at the offices of Karmic Management, one of three Los Angeles-based companies assigned to handle entertainment, public relations and sponsorships for the Bieber project. But only Weinberg put up money. Weinberg said he paid $860,000 to Ahmed to secure the concert venues and $140,000 to Karmic Management to get a website created and for other parts of the deal. Ahmed sent Weinberg a text that the bank had confirmed the wire transfer of funds and said, \u201cI just got a call from President Obama\u2019s election campaign since I am the chair for Norway so they need me in Chicago today, so heading over there now.\u201d At that point, Weinberg said he thought the deal was on. \u201cAfter I invested the money, there was a lot of friendly collaborations happening,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cA lot of e-mails coming back and forth. Waleed was very involved and we started talking about who our ticketing agency was going to be, which was an organization that everyone has heard of. \u2026 We hired a company to start developing a website for the Scandinavian leg of the tour.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t long before, as Weinberg put it, \u201ca couple of things went off track.\u201d Conning the con man First, Weinberg said he started getting nervous when Ahmed \u201cwent off the radar\u201d for 10 days. \u201cWell, you can imagine after 10 days, we are freaking out,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cSomething is not right. Well, he surfaces and tells us, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, you know, I was basically out for a Muslim holiday. I was out for Ramadan, and I\u2019m sorry, but I am back. Let\u2019s go.\u2019 \u201c Around the same time, Weinberg said he began to hear about problems with the company handling the ticket sales. Then, Ahmed appeared on a radio interview in Norway, talking about his latest clothing purchases. \u201cShoes, jacket, I have more at home,\u201d Ahmed told NRK reporter Webj\u00f8rn Espeland. \u201cI was in the U.S. and shopped Louis Vuitton for approximately 60,000 NOK (Norwegian kroners).\u201d That\u2019s more than $10,000 in clothing. The next week, Ahmed returned to the United States. Weinberg got on a plane and met him in New York for dinner. \u201cThis whole thing was disturbing and extremely confusing. He was talking in circles, and nothing was adding up,\u201d Weinberg said. Then, the ruse came to an abrupt end when Weinberg learned that tickets for Bieber\u2019s Scandinavian concerts went on sale and quickly sold out. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cWe never had the deal. So this is when all of the alarms started going off, of course. And that\u2019s when Waleed got really squirrelly and became very hard to reach.\u201d Weinberg had had enough. He contacted the FBI. Meanwhile, Ahmed was in Norway in late September. During that trip, he posed for photos to accompany the radio interview he had given to Norway\u2019s NRK. He would then make a fateful decision to return one last time to the United States. Weinberg persuaded him to meet at a restaurant in San Francisco. They sat in a booth near the front door. Weinberg wore a wire, recording the conversation for the FBI. \u201cFor two hours, Waleed goes into this whole dissertation about how his life is over as he once knew it,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cThe Waleed Ahmed of Norway, the Mark Zuckerberg, the celebrity, the guy that everybody was excited about has now become a disappointment.\u201d Ahmed explained to Weinberg how his parents have disowned him, and how he is in such financial straits that he\u2019s going to lose his home \u2013 even his new Porsche. He said he planned to start his life over in Pakistan, where he has an uncle in the real estate business. \u201cMeanwhile, he\u2019s dressed again, Prada and Gucci head to toe,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cHe just flew in first class telling me that he\u2019s broke without realizing that he flew in style. I mean, this guy had again the audacity to just continue this lie with me, and I just wasn\u2019t buying it. But I was doing the best I could to bite my lip.\u201d The next day, on September 23, 2012, the FBI arrested Ahmed at San Francisco International Airport before he boarded a flight to Amsterdam. He admitted to the FBI that it was all a con job. In addition, according to an FBI affidavit, Ahmed created fake websites and e-mail addresses to pull off the scam. The conference call with the supposed member of Scooter Braun Management was actually one of Ahmed\u2019s friends in Norway. Other scams and close calls Today, Ahmed no longer wears Prada and Louis Vuitton. He\u2019s behind bars at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and is awaiting sentencing, scheduled for June 11. He refused a CNN request for an interview. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and FBI also would not comment because Ahmed has not yet been sentenced. But in a three-page letter to U.S. District Court Judge Philip Gutierrez, Ahmed wrote, \u201cI have disgusted many, I have been the source of shame and disrespect for my friends, family, community and followers. I accept my crime, while I regret every bit of time, all I have with broken words, is that I really regret every minute spent committing it.\u201d He told the judge that he \u201ccould not distinguish between right and wrong in the fire of desire and need for more.\u201d As for the famous people he claimed to know, a spokesman for Scooter Braun said he never heard of Ahmed. Ted Turner\u2019s spokesman said, \u201cWhile Mr. Turner might have attended a public event in Norway where Mr. Ahmed was in attendance, he does not know Mr. Ahmed personally, and did not meet him in Atlanta.\u201d Andrew Young said he did meet Ahmed and was shocked to learn he had been arrested. \u201cHe used my contacts for things that I didn\u2019t know about nor did he ever discuss with me,\u201d Young said. \u201cI mean, the first I heard from this was when he was arrested, and his lawyer called me and told me what he\u2019s been charged with, and my first reaction was there must be some misunderstanding.\u201d The other companies that Ahmed lined up for the Bieber deal also said they were fooled. Pikarinen, the Finnish beauty queen, said she knew nothing about any details of the deal. \u201cMy company was scammed as well,\u201d said Carmenita Cornish-Helligar, the CEO of Karmic Management, who hosted the contract signing after learning about Ahmed through an entertainment industry contact in London. \u201cI still have fallouts from it,\u201d she said. After Ahmed\u2019s arrest, other details of what led to the Bieber scam started to emerge. Months before Weinberg was approached, Ahmed was trying to line up other investors, including Atlanta businessman Robert Fowler. \u201cI almost got suckered into the same thing,\u201d said Fowler, who said he turned down the deal after he found out it wasn\u2019t legitimate. As it turns out, the Bieber con wasn\u2019t the only trouble for Ahmed. In 2011, he made a deal with an Atlanta medical supply company to distribute specialty medical gloves called \u201cEKG gloves\u201d to the Middle East. But the deal went sour, and the company was stuck with thousands of the gloves. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good con artist,\u201d said the company\u2019s owner, Billy Williams. His company, Affirmative Solutions, sued Ahmed and obtained a court judgment against him for money owed in the deal. Not only that, court documents from Norway reviewed by CNN show that Ahmed received a suspended jail sentence and was fined in 2008 for forging paperwork when he was 17, to get into a school. In 2011, he was investigated for insurance fraud for claiming his BMW had been stolen in Oslo. Five months before Ahmed met Weinberg, he bilked another investor out of $600,000 in another investment scam after pretending he was part of a development project, according to the Norwegian court documents. Even the supposed iPhone solar charger that made him famous in Norway may not be his own invention, according to Norwegian press reports, which also revealed that Ahmed had made up how many devices had been ordered. In a 37-page document filed with the court on June 3, the government argues for a 100-month prison term, citing Ahmed\u2019s history of criminal activity. His attorney is asking for an 18-month sentence. \u201cIn reviewing defendant\u2019s communications, I was struck by how much pleasure he got out of betraying victim\u2019s trust, and his lack of respect for the victim,\u201d wrote FBI Special Agent Alice Tsujihara. \u201cDefendant texted that he should get the \u2018Best Scandinavian Thieves\u2019 award\u2019 and that \u2018being a thief is a profession.\u2019 \u201c A friend in Norway who went to business school with Ahmed helped him pull off the Bieber scam, she wrote, by creating false documents and posing as business associates. \u201cTo defendant, fraud was \u2018like poker or blackjack\u2019 where you \u2018call or raise. Never fold!\u2019 \u201d Tsujihara wrote. Weinberg said he didn\u2019t know anything about Ahmed\u2019s previous troubles. As of now, he hasn\u2019t gotten any of his money back. \u201cI feel sorry for him,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also furious. \u2026 It\u2019s all that I\u2019ve got to not get on an airplane and go to visit him in prison, and not sit across from him and just ask, \u2018Why, why would you do this?\u2019 \u201c NRK reporters Webjorn Espeland and Cathrine Elnan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Watch CNN\u2019s Dr. Sanjay Gupta interview Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at 8 p.m. ET on Anderson Cooper 360. Rollout setbacks embolden critics on the right and raise public doubts How did administration botch the introduction of its signature policy achievement? Some reasons political, others technical but presidential oversell appears to be one It seems like a long time since Vice President Joe Biden whispered a bit too loudly to President Barack Obama that his imminent signing of the 2010 Affordable Care Act was \u201ca big f\u2014ing deal.\u201d Biden was right \u2013 it was big then, and is even bigger more than three years later. However, most of the talk today is about problems with Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms that are emboldening hyper-partisan critics on the political right and raising public doubts about the system\u2019s viability. How could it be that the administration, with so much time to implement the overhaul the health insurance overhaul, ended up botching the roll out of the most controversial provision \u2013 the individual mandate requiring people to obtain coverage or face a fine. Report: Healthcare website failed test ahead of rollout Some reasons are political and others are technical, but all point to a mix of presidential over-promising, rabid political opposition and the arcane contracting process used by the government to choose which companies got the job of devising a website enrollment system unprecedented in its size and complexity. Here is a look at how we got here: Obamacare's website woes Governor: Obamacare is going to work Jon Stewart, others take on Obamacare Report: Obamacare site failed early test 1) Water drop torture The health care reforms were signed into law more than three years ago, so why are we still fixated on their implementation? Because of the incremental process of starting up the vast program intended to expand health coverage to tens of millions of uninsured people. It was never going to be easy, but waiting for the system to come into full operation made it more vulnerable to a negative reaction. Now Republican critics wonder how the administration could get it so wrong after having so much time to prepare. \u201cGod only knows how much money they\u2019ve spent and it\u2019s a failure,\u201d Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cYou know, the government simply isn\u2019t going to be able to get this job done correctly.\u201d Obama said Monday that \u201cthe essence of the law\u201d \u2013 aimed at providing access to health insurance for the roughly 48 million Americans without it \u2013 \u201cis working just fine.\u201d \u201cIn some cases, actually, it\u2019s exceeding expectations. The prices are lower than expected, and the choice is greater than we expected,\u201d he said of the market exchanges that came on line on October 1. The problem, he said, was \u201cthe website that\u2019s supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People are getting stuck during the application process,\u201d Obama continued, taking a shot at the law\u2019s critics by adding: \u201cIt\u2019s time for folks to stop rooting for its failure, because hard working middle-class families are rooting for its success.\u201d What works, what doesn\u2019t work on Healthcare.gov 2) Website woes There are problems \u2013 major ones \u2013 with Healthcare.gov. While initial difficulties in logging in appear to be easing, tech experts say the use of multiple contractors to develop different aspects of the system appears to have resulted in a lack of compatibility between the different components. A former member of Obama\u2019s technology team said Healthcare.gov was created by a \u201csloppy\u201d team of contractors who were selected through a flawed federal procurement process. Clay Johnson, who served for six months as a Presidential Innovation Fellow beginning in August 2012, wrote in a blog post on October 7 that signs of flaws on the website were apparent from the day it went online, including the use of placeholder text in the site\u2019s code. In an interview with CNN, Johnson said the federal government is increasingly relying on a shrinking list of preferred contractors for its technology work in a process that is producing lackluster outcomes. \u201cThere\u2019s been a consolidation of incumbent vendors and they\u2019ve gotten lazy as a result,\u201d Johnson told CNN. \u201cThey haven\u2019t kept up with the market.\u201d On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that a trial run of Healthcare.gov days before its launch crashed the site with a just a few hundred users online. Despite the problems, federal health officials proceeded with the planned rollout, according to the newspaper. The result? The website crashed shortly after midnight as several thousand people tried to start the process, two people familiar with the project told the Post. Later this week, three of the contractors responsible for the website - CGI, Serco, and Equifax \u2013 will testify before a congressional committee about problems on the site. In a statement, CGI said it and other contractors \u201care working around the clock for the improvement of HealthCare.gov, a system that is complex, ambitious and unprecedented.\u201d Like he did with the Gulf oil spill, Obama has brought in outside experts in a move labeled a \u201ctech surge\u201d to try to assist in fixing the website problems. On Tuesday, the White House said that Jeff Zients, the former acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, is part of the team of technical expert helping the Department of Health andHuman Services manage the process. This time, though, the problem is the result of his administration\u2019s planning and implementation, rather than a private company. The Republican National Committee challenged the government \u201ctech surge,\u201d saying in a statement that it was \u201ccode for \u2018spending surge,\u2019 and will waste hundreds of millions of unbudgeted taxpayer dollars.\u201d CNNMoney: Healthcare.gov needs a lot of work, but it\u2019s fixable 3) We knew this was coming Big start-ups always have problems, White House spokesman Jay Carney has said more than once in recent days, so no one should have expected the Obamacare rollout to occur without some glitches. However, the scope of the problems has been more comprehensive than expected, with people using Healthcare.gov facing lengthy delays or getting blocked from completing the process of signing up for the new exchanges. In addition, insurance companies that provide coverage say they are getting incomplete customer information and duplicate applications from the system. The White House also indicated a larger-than-expected number of visitors to Healthcae.gov exacerbated problems in the software. While Obama called the problems inexcusable, he said several hundred thousand people have managed to sign up. While that\u2019s a large number, it\u2019s only a fraction of the 48 million uninsured and 20 million who have visited HealthCare.gov. Obamacare applications near half million; website called \u2018unacceptable\u2019 Carney shrugged off the issue of whether the website was ready for full action on October 1, telling reporters Tuesday that \u201cwe never said, or would have said, or would have predicted that we\u2019d get millions of people on the first day.\u201d 4) GOP attack dog The political origins of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 left it vulnerable to partisan attacks. It was passed by Democrats in the House and Senate with no Republican support, and GOP opponents continued to attack it in the following three years. Conservatives consider the health care reforms the most severe example of big government overreach, and they know it will boost Democratic support from millions of people able to purchase health insurance for the first time due the reforms. It is no coincidence that the strongest Republican effort to derail Obamacare is occurring as the most controversial aspect of the reforms takes effect \u2013 the individual mandate to purchase health insurance by March 31 or face a fine. Rubio calls for delay of Obamacare sign-up deadline Never mind that the Supreme Court upheld the law last year \u2013 Republicans remain intent on dismantling it in any way possible, including claims about its problems that are sensational and sometimes outright false. CNN Fact Check: Obamacare For example, the website Politicfact.com ruled that leading Obamacare opponent Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas spoke falsely last week when he claimed that the health care reforms meant higher premiums for \u201cvirtually every person\u201d in America. Factcheck.org said Cruz \u201cdistorted the impact of the Affordable Care Act\u201d on senior citizens and disabled children. Obama opened himself to some of the GOP criticism in his zealous campaigning for health care reforms dating back to his first election campaign and continuing through the legislative battle to get the Affordable Care Act passed. In particular, Republicans cite his frequent line that \u201cif you like your insurance, you can keep it,\u201d noting that some employers have changed or dropped providers due to the reforms, making their workers take on new programs or seek their own coverage. Escalating Republican attacks in recent week seek to depict chaos and long-term harm for Obamacare, but the strategy may have backfired. Kentucky governor praises health care launch By adding demands to dismantle or defund Obamacare to a spending plan needed to prevent a government shutdown, House Republicans made themselves vulnerable to blame when Obama rejected the move and the government actually started shutting down. The shutdown began on October 1, the same day as Healthcare.gov came on line, and the political debate focused on the congressional dysfunction instead of the early reports of major problems encountered by people trying to log in to purchase health insurance. In the 16 days until last week\u2019s agreement to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling to avoid a possible U.S. default, polls indicated support for Obama and the health care reforms holding steady or even ticking up, while Republicans got blamed for the troubles caused by the brinksmanship and shutdown. CNN Poll: GOP, Boehner take shutdown hit CNN Poll: 75% say most Republicans in Congress don\u2019t deserve re-election Now Republicans are trying to make up for the lost opportunity by hammering harder on the website woes as a reflection of the overall inability to implement and manage Obamacare. A new CBS News poll released Tuesday showed that just 12% of respondents think the process is going well, with nearly half saying it\u2019s not going well. And an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday showed that 56% of those questioned said the website failures are a sign of broader problems to come.

            "article_content": "In a PBS interview, Obama dismisses criticism that \"now he's Dick Cheney\" National security is his No. 1 priority -- then he adds middle class woes are important, too Obama and China's president \"had a very blunt conversation about cybersecurity\" Obama disagrees with those who say the U.S. is scarred by Iraq and should avoid Syria As his popularity has dropped to 45%, the lowest in a year and a half, President Barack Obama talked with PBS\u2019 Charlie Rose. The president covered a world of issues, including how some critics now liken him to a particular Republican adversary. Here are his thoughts on seven of the topics he discussed on Monday evening. Obama as the new Dick Cheney? When asked if there is enough transparency in how government seeks secret court orders to obtain phone records, Obama abruptly brought up former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served under President George W. Bush. \u201cSome people say well, Obama was this raving liberal before, now he\u2019s Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney sometimes says, \u2018Yes, you know, he took it all, lock stock and barrel,\u2019\u201d Obama said, referring to the Bush-Cheney security agenda. Obama bristles at suggestion he has shifted on snooping \u201cMy concern has always been not that we shouldn\u2019t do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances?\u201d Obama added. His administration has advanced checks on security initiatives, he said. \u201cYou know, what amuses me is now folks on the right who were fine when it was a Republican president but now Obama\u2019s coming in with a black helicopter,\u201d Obama added. Obama asserted that the process of securing secret rulings from the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act court is transparent and is examined by the U.S. Justice Department and Congress. On surveillance In the wake of revelations that his administration secured a secret court order to obtain Verizon phone logs, the president assured Americans that the National Security Agency isn\u2019t listening to phone calls or targeting personal e-mails \u2013 unless the government has a specific court order to do so. Obama\u2019s job is to balance national security and personal freedom. \u201cTo say there\u2019s a trade-off doesn\u2019t mean somehow that we\u2019ve abandoned freedom. I don\u2019t think anybody says we\u2019re no longer free because we have checkpoints at airports,\u201d Obama said. \u201cMy job is both to protect the American people and to protect the American way of life, which includes our privacy. And so every program that we engage in, what I\u2019ve said is, let\u2019s examine and make sure that we\u2019re making the right tradeoffs,\u201d Obama added. His top priorities National security is Obama\u2019s No. 1 priority, he said, but he quickly added he hasn\u2019t forgotten you \u2013 the working person now reeling in the recession\u2019s aftermath and struggling to find or keep a job. That\u2019s why he became president in the first place, he said. \u201cThe biggest challenge we face right now, in addition to the ongoing challenge of national security, is having recovered from the worst recession since the Great Depression, having dug our way out, with the economy now growing, jobs being created, auto industry back, stock market back, housing recovering by about 10% in terms of prices,\u201d Obama said, \u201chow do we now go back to the issue that led me to run for president in the first place \u2013 which is the fact that the economy is not working for everybody, that we have the structural problems that could lead us to second-rate status if they continue.\u201d Growing economic inequality and declining wages for middle-class families is occurring in the United States \u2013 and \u201cworldwide,\u201d Obama added \u2013 because of globalization and technology. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to address that if we are going to continue to be the greatest nation on Earth,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd that is the thing that I\u2019m going to be focused on for the remainder of my presidency, along with the basics like making sure nobody blows us up.\u201d Iran\u2019s new president Obama noted how the newly elected president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, is a centrist, which gives Obama optimism that Iran may now want to seriously address its nuclear program, which many feel is being used to eventually build weapons. In response, Iran is now being internationally punished with \u201cthe most powerful\u201d economic sanctions ever applied against it, Obama said. \u201cThe Iranian people rebuffed the hardliners and the clerics in the election who were counseling no compromise on anything, anytime, anywhere,\u201d Obama said. \u201cClearly you have a hunger within Iran to engage with the international community in a more positive way. U.S. takes \u2018wait and see\u2019 stance on Iran\u2019s new president \u201cOur bottom lines have been, show the international community that you\u2019re abiding by international treaties and obligations, that you\u2019re not developing a nuclear weapon.\u201d Supporting Syrian opposition Though his administration has declared that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons in his country\u2019s two-year civil war, and as a result he has pledged military support for the opposition, Obama avoided specifying what kind of military support that will be. What complicates the matter is how some of the Syrian opposition is affiliated with al Qaeda. G8 leaders agree on need but not methods to stop Syrian bloodshed \u201cOne of the challenges that we have is that some of the most effective fighters within the opposition have been those who, frankly, are not particularly friendly toward the United States of America. And arming them willy-nilly is not a good recipe for meeting American interests over the long term,\u201d Obama said. He also spoke of avoiding a sectarian Islamic quagmire between Shiites and Sunnis in Syria. The United States has learned some hard lessons from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, he said. \u201cWe know what it\u2019s like to rush into a war in the Middle East without having thought it through. And there are elements within the Middle East who see this entirely through the prism of a Shia/Sunni conflict and want the United States to simply take the side of the Sunnis. And that I do not think serves American interests,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow on the other side there are folks who say, \u2018You know we are so scarred from Iraq, we should have learned our lesson, we should not have anything to do with it.\u2019 \u201cWell I reject that view as well because the fact of the matter is that we\u2019ve got serious interests there and not only humanitarian interests. We can\u2019t have a situation of ongoing chaos in a major country that borders a country like Jordan, which in turn borders Israel. And we have a legitimate need to be engaged and to be involved.\u201d Meeting with China on alleged hacking Last week, Obama met with new Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. president broached the serious allegations of hacking against China. \u201cYou know, when you\u2019re having a conversation like this I don\u2019t think you ever expect a Chinese leader to say, \u2018You know what? You\u2019re right. You caught us red-handed. We\u2019re just stealing all your stuff and every day we try to figure out how we can get into Apple,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u2018New model\u2019 for U.S.-China relations But, he added: \u201cWe had a very blunt conversation about cybersecurity\u201d with the Chinese president. Ben Bernanke on way out? Asked if he is going to reappoint Ben Bernanke to a third term as Federal Reserve chairman, Obama sidestepped a direct answer, opening the door to speculation that Bernanke\u2019s tenure may be ending. \u201cHe\u2019s already stayed a lot longer than he wanted, or he was supposed to,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe has been an outstanding partner along with the White House in helping us recover much stronger than, for example, our European partners from what could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions.\u201d Bernanke led the central bank\u2019s response to the global financial collapse that began in fall 2007, keeping interest rates at historic lows and shepherding a massive Fed intervention in the government bond market. He became chairman in February 2006 as an appointee of President George W. Bush. Obama appointed Bernanke to a second term in 2010. Bernanke\u2019s term expires on January 31, 2014.",

            "article_content": "With departures of long-serving members, a new Senate is emerging First Japanese-American woman and first openly gay woman joined Senate this year Record number of women now serve and growing number of senators have young children Aggressive conservatives are shaking up makeup of Republican side of the aisle With South Dakota Democrat Tim Johnson\u2019s announcement this week that he will not seek re-election this year, the recent string of Senate retirements has the political class debating whether Republicans have a real shot at taking control of the upper chamber. But this biennial parlor game overlooks a stunning dynamic that has been developing on Capitol Hill over the past decade: massive turnover. Think back to late 2004, when a young hotshot from Illinois had just been elected to the Senate. National TV appearances led to obvious questions about his future political plans, but the senator-elect joked that he would finish out a full term, considering he was entering the upper chamber as its 99th-ranking member. Consider this: \u2022 If Barack Obama had stayed in the Senate, he would be ranked 46th today. Given all the retirements that have been announced for the 2014 election cycle, he\u2019d be ranked at least as high as 39th \u2013 and maybe higher \u2013 in early 2015. In other words, he would have taken a giant leap in seniority had he waited until 2016 to run for president. \u2022 Only 32 current senators were in office in 2001 for the September 11 attacks. That number will shrink to 28 \u2013 perhaps even lower \u2013 when the next Congress convenes in early 2015. \u2022 Since the Republicans last had the Senate majority headed into the 2006 midterm elections, 54 new senators have joined the chamber. (Fifteen new members have been sworn in since last fall\u2019s election; 14 new members joined after the 2010 election and another 15 after the 2008 election. There were 12 new senators as of the 2006 elections \u2013 and 11 of those remain. Virginia Democrat Jim Webb served just one term and was succeeded by Democrat Tim Kaine.) McCain: Experience is beneficial Rand Paul steals the spotlight Change in Senate A few lions of the Senate remain, like Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy. The Senate\u2019s most-senior member has served 38 years. But so many of his contemporaries have left the building. This year, West Virginia Democrat John Rockefeller, New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg and Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin decided to call it quits after 30 years each. Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who is also not seeking re-election next year, will have 36 years of Senate service to his name when his successor takes office in early 2015. Senate passes its first budget proposal in four years Last cycle, it was North Dakota\u2019s Kent Conrad (D), Indiana\u2019s Richard Lugar (R), New Mexico\u2019s Jeff Bingaman (D) and Wisconsin\u2019s Herb Kohl (D), among many more. In recent years, the Senate has lost Edward Kennedy, Robert Byrd, Daniel Inouye and Craig Thomas to death in office. Other long-time senators like Joe Biden and John Kerry have moved to the executive branch. Consequently, a much different Senate is emerging. The first Japanese-American woman, Mazie Hirono, and the first openly gay woman, Tammy Baldwin, joined the Senate this year. The country\u2019s most exclusive club boasts a record number of women, 20; a Cuban-American Republican and an African-American Republican both in their 40s; and a growing number of senators with young children (and who still are many years away from grandchildren). Another case in point: If a Democrat succeeds Lautenberg in deep-blue New Jersey, it could be Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who is running for the open seat. Lautenberg at 89 years old is more than twice the age of Booker, who is 43. And on the other side of the aisle, aggressive conservatives are shaking things up, too. Already running for Johnson\u2019s seat in South Dakota is 58-year-old Republican Gov. Mike Rounds. But the Senate Conservatives Fund blasted Rounds on Tuesday for not being conservative enough. Republican campaign sources say the group has met with Republican Rep. Kristi Noem to recruit her into the race instead. Noem, a 41-year-old mother of three, is quietly considering the race. Of course, Democrats have their own younger options, like former Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, 42; or Johnson\u2019s son, U.S. attorney Brendan Johnson, 38. Even though party leaders on both sides of the aisle like to keep retirements each cycle to a minimum, Democratic operatives say they\u2019re not disappointed in the predicament this year, because those with access to early polling data in states like West Virginia and South Dakota say some of the younger, newer faces in those states are polling better against potential Republican opponents than the veteran senators did. Senate Historian Donald Ritchie says that overall, the trend is a cyclical one, but he acknowledges that the current dynamic stands out. \u201cWe have 45 senators serving in their first six-year term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable. It\u2019s the largest turnover we\u2019ve had since the late 1970s.\u201d Ritchie remembers a long list of retirements in 1976 and 1978, followed by a rout of veteran senators in 1980. \u201cThis is a very personality-driven institution,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you change some of these larger-than-life personalities, it really changes the place.\u201d Ritchie expects that some of the newer members will become veteran, seasoned members in time for a new generation, but he conceded that the brain drain in the upper chamber does infringe on some of the important expertise. Indeed, according to a handful of experienced Washingtonians who have worked in and around the Senate, the heavy turnover cuts both ways. Leadership aides close to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell say that he and some of his staff believe there\u2019s more energy in the upper chamber now and more of a willingness to fight for causes. Despite some of the nostalgia surrounding some of the old bulls who were more comfortable compromising and cutting deals, they believe the GOP conference is working harder than ever. Democratic Senate aides say a positive outcome of the Senate\u2019s changing face is that Americans may now find them more relatable. And it makes the tough task of recruiting new candidates easier with a diverse caucus because more potential recruits can actually see themselves in the Senate. Bob Stevenson, a Republican, and Jim Manley, a Democrat, were longtime and highly influential staffers within the Senate leadership. Warner joins fellow senators supporting same-sex marriage Both harbor typical complaints about the opposing party, but they both long for the days of compromise, when some of the younger, newer members respected their elders. \u201cMaking the Senate work requires cooperation and compromise,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cDeal-making and compromise have never been \u2018easy,\u2019 but the leaders forced it on the rank-and-file. Not as much today.\u201d Stevenson, who advised former Republican majority leader Bill Frist, continued, \u201cSharp division in the country and \u2018compromise equals weakness\u2019 is reflected in the younger members. Great political strategy but not conducive to governing.\u201d Manley advised the first Democratic majority leader after Frist, Harry Reid. Now outside the Senate, he complained about some of the same things: that the massive turnover also means a loss of institutional knowledge. \u201cThere\u2019s no one to negotiate with in the House with a Republican caucus full of tea party types,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter 21 years in the Senate, I\u2019ve come reluctantly to the conclusion that the process on Capitol Hill is broken.\u201d Manley continued, \u201cTimes have changed, and the Senate\u2019s changed. It\u2019s the influx of new members from the House that brought all the bad habits they developed in the House.\u201d And citing Texas Republican Ted Cruz, he said, \u201cThis is a potent group of freshmen who have no respect for the Senate as an institution, who would rather burn the place down so they can remake it again.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama and House Democrats discuss entitlement changes Obama and Senate Republicans hold what both sides call \"great\" talks Sen. McConnell says Obama must deliver Democratic support for needed reforms Congress begins debating budget proposals for 2014 from both parties President Barack Obama wrapped up three days of personal outreach on Capitol Hill, holding what both sides called a \u201cgreat\u201d meeting on Thursday with Senate Republicans who urged him to deliver the necessary Democratic support for making needed reforms to popular entitlement programs. \u201cHe certainly understands that you can\u2019t fix the country without adjusting entitlements to fit the demographics of our country,\u201d said Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, usually a harsh critic of the president. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see where we go from here, but it was a great meeting.\u201d For his part, Obama labeled the more than 90-minute meeting as a \u201cgreat conversation\u201d as he headed to a separate gathering with House Democrats opposed to significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid, which provide health care to senior citizens, the poor and the disabled. After the second meeting, Obama said progress was made, and some House Democrats expressed willingness to discuss changes to entitlement programs as part of a broad agreement that would include GOP concessions on taxes. The two meetings concluded a week of what reporters dubbed Obama\u2019s \u201ccharm offensive\u201d \u2013 a series of talks with legislators \u2013 as Congress began debating budget proposals for 2014. A formal budget process, with both chambers considering separate plans from each party that would be debated and negotiated in coming months, is considered the last opportunity this year to forge a compromise on reducing the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. Such an agreement proved unreachable in Obama\u2019s first term and the president emphasized during his meeting with Senate Republicans on Thursday that he sought bipartisan solutions to major issues after his re-election, according to participants. \u201cHe mentioned there are some theories out there that he\u2019s trying to lure everyone into a trap, if you will, as a way to take back the House or whatever, and he assured us he\u2019s simply trying to get a budget deal done,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona. \u201cSo as much as our base or others are convinced the president has nefarious motives, he challenged us to challenge them on that.\u201d In addition, Obama told the GOP senators that \u201che\u2019s going to have to bring some people from his party along on entitlement reforms who don\u2019t want anything to happen, and he challenged us to do the same,\u201d Flake said. Asked if any of the meeting could be labeled contentious, Flake answered \u201cno.\u201d The positive response, with none of the usual partisan rhetoric that has dominated political debate in Washington, signaled that both sides perceived a willingness in the other to tackle at least some of the tax and spending issues that have proven intractable in recent years. \u201cWe need from him two things,\u201d said McConnell, R-Kentucky. \u201cHe needs to be directly involved, not \u2013 as we used to say \u2013 leading from behind, but directly involved.  And his job is to deliver the members of his party.\u201d In particular, he said, Obama must explain the need for entitlement reforms. Obama\u2019s liberal base opposes any significant changes to entitlements, arguing senior citizens paid into the programs during their lives and deserve the benefits promised them such as health care coverage and Social Security checks. \u201cOnly one person in the government has a big enough pulpit to explain that,\u201d McConnell said. In the meeting with House Democrats, Obama discussed entitlement reforms including his offer to tighten the adjustment for inflation of benefits such as Social Security, meaning annual increases for future recipients would grow at a slower pace, according to participants. Opponents of the reform, known as \u201cchained CPI\u201d in reference to the Consumer Price Index it involves, argue it hurts senior citizens and others who most need their benefits. However, some House Democrats indicated after the meeting they were open to discussing such a change if Republicans showed they were open to increased tax revenue. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to entertain any significant entitlement conversation until the Republicans meet us halfway with a revenue conversation,\u201d said Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina. \u201cThose two conversations must be able to happen at the same time.\u201d Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New York, said she opposed the chained CPI idea, but was willing to discuss it because Obama told the meeting there could be exceptions to protect \u201cthe most vulnerable.\u201d Meanwhle, McConnell and other GOP senators said they agreed with Obama in their meeting on the need to overhaul the corporate tax system to lower rates in order to make American companies more competitive abroad. However, House Speaker John Boehner offered a less optimistic view a day after Obama met with House Republicans, telling reporters that \u201cthis is going to take more than dinner dates and phone calls.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s idea of compromise is just \u2018do it my way,\u2019 and that\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Boehner said in reference to the call by Obama and Democrats for increased tax revenue to be part of any compromise on deficit reduction. Noting that Congress approved a return to higher tax rates of the 1990s on top income earners in January, Boehner said Obama \u201cgot his tax hikes\u201d in that deal and \u201cnow it\u2019s time to cut spending.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was fully aware of the \u201cenormous obstacles\u201d to compromise. He blamed what he called \u201can absolutist position\u201d by Republicans such as Boehner in opposing the Democratic demand for deficit reduction to include both spending cuts and increased tax revenue. Carney characterized such opponents as saying \u201cno way, no how\u201d to more revenue even though \u201cthe public ultimately supports that approach, even though there are voices in the Republican Party who believe that\u2019s the right approach to take.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see if there are enough members \u2013 Republican members \u2013 of the caucus of common sense to allow for progress to be made,\u201d he added. Compromise is needed to prevent a recurrence of political showdowns like those from Obama\u2019s first term that contributed to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and sluggish economic recovery. In an interview broadcast Wednesday on ABC, Obama warned such agreement may prove unattainable. \u201cRight now what I\u2019m trying to do is create an atmosphere where Democrats and Republicans can go ahead and get together and try to get something done,\u201d he said of his so-called charm offensive that has included a dinner with GOP senators, lunch with House leaders and the meetings with both party caucuses in Congress. \u201cBut ultimately it may be that the differences are just too wide.\u201d Opinion: Ryan budget is a firing offense Last week, the president invited a dozen Republican senators to dinner and hosted lunch with the top members of the House Budget Committee to launch what reporters dubbed the charm offensive. His outreach continued this week with visits to the Capitol on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, concluded by his meeting with House Democrats after the talks with Senate Republicans. Meanwhile, both the House and Senate budget committees began working this week on separate spending proposals for fiscal year 2014 that reflected the deep partisan divisions in Washington over tax and funding issues. Republicans led by their conservative base seek to shrink the size and cost of government, opposing any new tax revenue while pushing for spending cuts and lower tax rates that they say will spur more economic growth. After agreeing in January to allow the higher tax rates on top income earners, Republican leaders say they oppose any further steps to raise taxes. Obama and Democrats say they want to protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and that comprehensive deficit reduction must include increased taxes on wealthy Americans to prevent the burden of austerity steps from shifting too much to the middle class, the elderly and other vulnerable demographics. The Senate budget proposal for 2014 by Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Washington, called for a mix of increased tax revenue and spending cuts to reduce deficits by about $1.9 trillion over 10 years. House GOP, Obama meet face to face but don\u2019t see eye to eye It would increase revenue by about $975 billion by eliminating and curtailing tax breaks and loopholes for wealthy Americans and corporations. It would also cut spending by an estimated $975 billion: $493 billion in domestic spending; $240 billion in defense spending; and $242 billion in interest savings. The proposal included a $100 billion economic stimulus package for road and bridge repairs, as well as worker training, that Murray said would be paid for by curtailing tax breaks for high-income households and corporations. However, the Senate plan avoided significant changes to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which are major drivers of federal deficits. Obama will introduce his own budget proposal next month, and the president and Democrats concede their approaches would not eliminate annual deficits, as sought by Republicans, but instead reduce them to what they say are manageable levels. Republicans call such an approach inadequate, insisting that government has become too large and costly to ensure needed economic growth. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, proposed a conservative spending plan for 2014 that he said would eliminate the annual deficit in a decade without raising taxes. It calls for cutting $5 trillion from projected spending increases in the next 10 years while lowering tax rates and getting rid of most of Obama\u2019s signature legislation of his first term \u2013 the 2010 health care reform law. Ryan also revived his proposal to reform Medicare, the health care program for senior citizens that is considered the biggest driver of rising federal deficits as costs increase and more Americans become eligible. The idea was a major issue in last year\u2019s presidential election, in which Ryan was the vice presidential candidate on the GOP ticket that lost to Obama. His Medicare revision calls for offering senior citizens a choice between traditional fee-for-service Medicare and a premium support system that would provide a fixed government payment to help them buy private health insurance. The plan would take effect in 2024 to exempt people 55 and older today. Obama dismisses balancing budget for \u2018sake of balance\u2019 By clearly staking out positions in their budget proposals, Obama and Congress appear intent on trying to avoid the crisis-driven brinksmanship of the past four years. However, the familiar, partisan nature of the budget plans illuminated the continuing political division that the public blames for legislative dysfunction. A CBS News poll last week showed more than 70% of respondents want both sides to compromise to end the brinksmanship over taxes and spending that dominated Obama\u2019s first term. Carney shoots down notion that Obama\u2019s charm offensive is fake During the past four years, House Republicans pushed through partisan budgets that Senate Democrats ignored, forcing the repeated extension of past spending plans. What\u2019s in Paul Ryan\u2019s budget Meanwhile, the president\u2019s budget proposals generated little support in Congress. The upcoming negotiations are complicated by lingering fiscal issues from past showdowns. Deep cuts to military and other discretionary spending took effect this month, and both sides were expected to try to soften their impact through a separate funding measure for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. Carney slams notion that charm offensive is fake Called a continuing resolution, it must pass by March 27 to prevent a partial government shutdown. The Republican-led House passed its version last week, and the Democrat-led Senate took up its own version this week. Congress also must authorize an increase in the federal borrowing limit this summer, and Republicans have made clear they intend to leverage that moment to try to extract concessions.

            "article_content": "Democrats and Republicans in Congress unveiling their budget plans this week Deficit reduction underlies the debate on government spending Forced spending cuts from a past deal complicate the issues Possible outcomes include a grand bargain, petite bargain or no deal Whether political theater or sincere outreach, President Barack Obama\u2019s so-called charm offensive is part of what shapes up to be the first formal congressional budget debate since he took office four years ago. Obama invited a dozen Senate Republicans to dinner and then hosted lunch at the White House with two House leaders last week. He will meet separately in coming days with House Republicans and Democrats as both parties begin unveiling their budget plans for the rest of this year and 2014. Wary Republicans call the president\u2019s new outreach a good first step, but said the style must be matched by substance. \u201cI believe anytime both parties are talking it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California told CNN on Sunday, adding: \u201cIs this about politics, or is this genuine? Only time will tell.\u201d House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin also said Sunday on Fox that Obama must change from the campaigner-in-chief who Republicans believe is only interested in promoting party goals. \u201cWill he resume attacking Republicans and impugning our motives?  Will he resume what is long believed to be a plan to win the 2014 elections?\u201d asked Ryan, the GOP vice-presidential nominee last year who took part in last week\u2019s White House lunch with the president. \u201cOr will he sincerely change and try and find common ground, try and work with Republicans to get something done? That\u2019s what we hope happens,\u201d he added. To Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Conference, rebuilding damaged relations is necessary on both sides for any progress to occur. \u201cThere is a trust deficit and the way in my experience in 20 years as a legislator that you close that trust gap is to sit down and continue to talk,\u201d she told ABC on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m a lot more likely to reach consensus and agree on the facts when I have spent some time getting to know, and working with, the other side.\u201d The Republican-led House has passed a proposal to fund the government through September \u2013 the end of the current fiscal year \u2013 and Ryan will unveil his 2014 spending plan this week to kick off the congressional back-and-forth. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats plan to detail their own proposals as soon as this week, and the White House was expected to bring out its budget plan next month. \u201cThe president will outline again through the budget process his priorities \u2013 economic priorities and policy priorities, both in deficit reduction and in economic growth and job creation,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Monday. \u201cAnd his budget will contribute to the process of regular order that we hope will produce bipartisan, balanced deficit reduction.\u201d By clearly staking out positions in the formal budgeting process, Obama and Congress appear intent on trying to avoid the crisis-driven brinksmanship of the past four years that deepened Washington\u2019s defining political divide. During Obama\u2019s first term, House Republicans passed partisan budgets that Senate Democrats ignored, forcing the repeated extension of past spending plans. Meanwhile, the president\u2019s budget proposals generated little support in Congress. The upcoming negotiations are complicated by lingering fiscal issues from past showdowns. Deep cuts to military and other discretionary spending took effect this month, and both sides were expected to try to soften their impact through the funding measure for the rest of 2013, which is called a continuing resolution. It must pass by March 27 to prevent a partial government shutdown. Congress also must authorize an increase in the federal borrowing limit this summer. Here are possible outcomes: The Grand Bargain A comprehensive deficit-reduction deal appeared close during Obama\u2019s first term, but eventually fell apart over the deep ideological differences regarding taxes. Such an agreement would reform the tax system to lower both personal and corporate rates while eliminating some loopholes and breaks. It also would reform Medicare and Medicaid and possibly Social Security to ensure their solvency. Republicans, especially conservatives, oppose any kind of increase in tax rates or revenue in their push to reduce the size of government. They also want to shrink the costs of entitlement programs that are the main drivers of chronic federal deficits and debt. Democrats want to preserve the social safety net of entitlements for the elderly, poor and disabled, with Obama and party leaders insisting on more tax revenue as part of any deficit deal. In winning re-election last year, Obama campaigned on protecting middle class Americans from the burden of deficit reduction, calling for the wealthy to contribute more in the form of increased tax revenue and other steps as part of entitlement reforms. The major sticking point of a comprehensive agreement will be taxes. Obama and Democrats want to eliminate tax breaks and loopholes worth about $600 billion over 10 years as part of a broader $1.2 trillion deficit-reduction package that would include entitlement reforms. Some Republicans have indicated support for ending such tax breaks as part of a broad deal. However, the fiscal-cliff agreement in January returned tax rates on top income earners to higher levels of the 1990s, and GOP leaders now oppose any further steps to raise rates or tax revenue. A sticking point in a possible compromise on taxes would be whether increased revenue realized through reforms, such as eliminating existing loopholes, go towards holding down rates or reducing the deficit. Meanwhile, Republicans say Obama and Democrats must deliver on significant entitlement reforms. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, argued Sunday on CBS that Obama must use his profile to convince fellow Democrats and the American people that changes to Medicare and other entitlements are necessary. \u201cWhat the president needs to do is reach out not just to Republicans but to Democrats and to ensure that he gives them the political cover to do frankly what most of them know needs to be done,\u201d Portman said. One of the GOP senators who dined with Obama last week said the president showed that he understood the scope of the problem, with Medicare paying out $3 in benefits for every $1 put in. \u201cI think he gets it,\u201d Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma told NBC on Sunday. \u201cAnd I think he`s genuinely reaching out.  But you`ve got a lot of scabs and sores on people that it`s going to take a while for that to heal.\u201d Another entitlement reform Obama has proposed would tighten the adjustment for inflation of benefits such as Social Security, meaning annual increases for future recipients would grow at a slower pace. Opponents of the reform, known as \u201cchained CPI\u201d in reference to the consumer price index it involves, argue it hurts vulnerable senior citizens and others who most need their benefits. If achieved, a grand bargain would give Obama a major political victory and a boost in cementing his desired presidential legacy after the controversial health care and Wall Street reforms of his first term. Republicans also would get credit from moderates and independents for a willingness to compromise, but conservatives could punish them with primary challenges in 2014 and beyond. Petite Bargain After the repeated failure of previous efforts for a broad deficit reduction deal, attention has focused on a more limited agreement that would include some elements under discussion. For example, a smaller agreement might end some tax breaks and loopholes while cutting Medicare costs paid providers, not beneficiaries, to achieve $500 billion or so in deficit reduction over 10 years. Such an outcome, coupled with previous spending cuts and the January fiscal-cliff deal, would fail to reach the total $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade that economists and political leaders have targeted as the minimum amount needed. It also would allow both parties to simultaneously claim credit for making some progress after the past years of dysfunction while continuing to blame the other for preventing more. No Bargain The status quo outcome would mean continued brinksmanship over each pending fiscal deadline, as well as further economic uncertainty that already has lowered the U.S. credit rating and slowed growth. For now, political leaders sound optimistic that resolve to move forward exists on both sides. \u201cI think there are things that we can do that don\u2019t offend either party\u2019s philosophy, that doesn\u2019t require someone to surrender their principles to make a good down payment on getting this debt and deficit under control,\u201d Ryan said Sunday. His budget proposal will include provisions certain to be rejected by Democrats, such as eliminating 2010 health care reforms that comprise Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, as well as shifting Medicaid to a grant program for states and changing Medicare from a direct benefit to a direct subsidy program. \u201cWe think that\u2019s the best way to make these programs work better, but are there things you can do short of that, that gets you closer to balancing the budget, that delays the debt crisis from hitting this country?\u201d Ryan asked. \u201cYes, I think there are.\u201d Obama\u2019s Medicare plan focuses mainly on reducing payments to drug companies and hospitals, though he would also raise revenue by asking wealthy seniors and new beneficiaries to pay more. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, a former governor who joined the chamber this year, told NBC that returning to a normal budgeting process creates a framework for debate and compromise. \u201cYou`re going to start to see both (chambers) put out their budgets, laying out visions for how to keep the economy strong and also deal with the deficit,\u201d Kaine said, adding: \u201cAt the end of the day, we`re going to have to find a balanced solution and it will involve all elements. It will involve talking about revenues, talking about expenses, talking about entitlements. We have to do that.\u201d CNNMoney\u2019s Tami Luhby and CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: The White House urges Republicans to favor the middle class over tax loopholes The plan raises taxes on millionaires, ends farm subsidies and cuts defense spending An aide to Sen. Mitch McConnell says Americans oppose higher taxes Spending cuts to take effect March 1 absent congressional action to avert them Senate Democrats proposed a $110 billion measure Thursday to put off mandatory across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect March 1. The package made public by Senate Democratic leaders calls for replacing the so-called sequester cuts with a combination of increased tax revenue from millionaires, ending agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the war in Afghanistan ends. Republican leaders in Congress have demanded that Democrats come up with a plan for avoiding the imminent cuts, technically known as sequestration. However, the GOP opposes any increase in tax rates or other steps to bring in more tax revenue, saying the nation needs to reduce the cost of government. Kerry: Cuts would hit foreign aid, diplomatic security Fear over the looming spending cuts Obama: Let's pay our bills on time Washington's budget battle Obama: Avoid sequester, pass small cuts \u201cI would respectfully disagree that the American people are going to suddenly demand more tax hikes,\u201d an aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said. A White House statement said that opposing what it called the balanced plan by Senate Democrats would amount to prioritizing \u201ctax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans.\u201d The issue extends a long-running political dispute over government spending and federal deficits that dominated President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, as well as his successful re-election campaign last year. Republicans were forced to concede on their steadfast opposition to increased taxes by agreeing in January to higher rates on top income earners as part of a deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of what was known as the fiscal cliff, which included the sequester cuts and automatic tax hikes. Napolitano: Spending cuts will hurt homeland security That agreement put off action on the sequester cuts, which were mandated by a 2011 agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling. The purpose of the deep cuts to all discretionary programs and the military was to motivate Congress to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement that would replace it. However, such a deal has proved impossible, leading to the imminent application of $85 billion in spending cuts for 2013 and almost $1 trillion over 10 years. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other officials warn that the cuts will have a dire impact on government operations and military readiness. The Pentagon would absorb about half of the reductions. While the White House and congressional leaders from both parties oppose sequestration, the approach for averting it has become the latest congressional showdown involving ideological differences over the size and role of government. House Speaker John Boehner noted on Thursday that the House passed bills last year to prevent the cuts from affecting the military, but Senate Democrats never acted. \u201cThose days are over,\u201d Boehner declared, but he also signaled a willingness to negotiate with the Senate over any legislation it sends over. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Senate to do their work.  We can \u2026 if they\u2019re willing to pass a bill, we\u2019ll find some way to work with them to address this problem.\u201d Panetta: World is watching U.S. on budget The plan unveiled Thursday by Senate Democrats would just replace the cuts through the end of this year, leaving time for possible negotiations on a broader deficit-reduction package that would eliminate sequestration entirely. The Democrats proposed $54 billion in revenue by implementing the \u201cBuffett rule,\u201d a principle by billionaire financier Warren Buffett that he shouldn\u2019t pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. Under it, anyone with adjusted income of more than $1 million after charitable deductions would pay a minimum 30% tax rate. Other revenue measures in the package include ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and closing tax loopholes for the oil industry. In addition, the package would cut military funding starting in 2015, following the planned end of U.S. combat operations next year in Afghanistan. It would also end agriculture subsidies for a total saving of $55 billion. \u201cBillions in direct payment subsidies are paid out even in good times and for crops farmers aren\u2019t even growing,\u201d explained Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. Panetta said Wednesday that Congress needs to put aside party and ideological divisions that he called \u201cthe greatest concern I have for our national security.\u201d He expressed concern over how the world will view the United States if it fails to avert sequestration. \u201cWhat (other countries) worry about is what I worry about, which is whether or not we can govern and whether or not we can face the tough decisions that have to be made and resolve those,\u201d Panetta said.

            "article_content": "Nine of the incoming 84 members of the House are returning to Capitol Hill Most of them lost their seats in 2010 when Republicans surged into control of the House Some returning members say their election losses weren't as much about them as the climate Lawmaker who served in '90s says Congress once worked across aisle Among the 84 House freshmen who unpacked new offices last week, a few are intimately familiar with doing the opposite \u2013 packing up and moving out of the Capitol. Nine members of the new class are former members of Congress who left Capitol Hill either by choice or by force. Redrawn congressional districts helped some of them get back; others had a change of heart after leaving voluntarily. Of the seven returning Democrats, almost all lost in 2010 when Republicans swept into control of the House. Though each used the two-year hiatus differently, many say the same thing about returning: The election losses were somewhat beyond the lawmakers\u2019 control, and they plan on being the same people they were when they last served in Congress. By the numbers: 113th Congress Welcoming the freshman class 113th Congress sworn in First Hindu lawmaker in Congress Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat who lost in 2010, remained engaged after her loss by teaching political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and serving on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. She said her close loss was \u201cnot a surprise\u201d to her and should be chalked up to a bad year for Democrats. \u201cMy positions, my values, my stance on things are no different now than they were then,\u201d Titus said. \u201cI won\u2019t change my principles in anyway. I would still vote for the health care bill, the American Recovery Act.\u201d Titus\u2019 vote for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature first-term legislation became a big part of the 2010 campaign and helped her opponent, Joe Heck, define the freshman congresswoman. Heck, who represents Nevada\u2019s 3rd District, is now one of Titus\u2019 colleagues. This story is familiar for Rep. Alan Grayson, a Florida Democrat who is back after being ousted in 2010. Grayson said he thinks that there was \u201cnothing that we could have done that would make a difference in the result\u201d and that his loss in 2010 was somewhat out of his control. Grayson might be the best-known member of the class because of his rant on the House floor during the health care debate when he said that the Republicans\u2019 plan for health care was for Americans not to get sick and to \u201cdie quickly\u201d if they did. Freshman lawmakers preview debt ceiling battle Grayson\u2019s outspokenness earned him the ire of conservatives and the affection of Democrats. And the fact that he represented a reliably Republican district doomed his re-election bid. In returning to Congress, Grayson said he wants to do more of what he did in his first term. \u201cI look back at the things that we accomplished, and I want to do more of them,\u201d Grayson said about cutting foreclosures and getting more grant money for his district. \u201cWe did a lot of good things for people in our district.\u201d In coming back to Congress, both Titus and Grayson swapped out notably swing districts for reliably Democratic ones. New Congress more religiously diverse? When former Rep. Shelley Berkley left her seat to run for Senate, Titus opted to run in Nevada\u2019s newly drawn 1st District after her home switched districts. The new district, which includes much of Las Vegas, including the Strip, is now widely considered the safest Democratic district in Nevada. Freshman member's goals,113th Congress Leaving Congress for now 113th Congress more diverse, partisan Grayson, too, upgraded to a safer seat when he moved from Florida\u2019s 8th to the 9th District, which includes 43.4% registered Democrats to 28.2% registered Republicans. The Democratic congressman ran unopposed in the party\u2019s primary and defeated Todd Long by almost 30 percentage points in the general election. \u201cThis district is entirely different,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cI have the freedom to concentrate on the job rather than to have to concentrate on the 24-month campaign.\u201d Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a Democrat from Arizona who also lost in 2010, said she looks at the loss as a \u201clearning experience.\u201d Though she was hesitant to say she wasn\u2019t going to change for this term, Kirkpatrick did say her first term was a good one. New Congress, new push for gun laws \u201cI am very proud of my votes in my first term,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cIt was a good session. \u2026 It was a good term.\u201d While still considered freshmen, the returnees get a bit more seniority then their first-year colleagues. In office selection, for example, they get to pick first and don\u2019t have to participate in drawing for offices. Other new members\u2019 hiatuses were a bit longer than one term \u2013 when Republican Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona first served in Congress, Bill Clinton was president, future presidential candidate Newt Gingrich was speaker of the House and the federal budget was balanced. Salmon was first elected in 1994 and served Arizona\u2019s 1st District for three terms. In 2001, the congressman left the Capitol because he promised his constituents that he would not serve more then three terms in Congress. Even though Salmon acknowledges he \u201cwon\u2019t be doing that this time,\u201d he seems quite nostalgic for his first three terms and hopes his next one will be similar. Low bar for new Congress \u201cI left Congress, and I felt like we made a real difference,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cThen they blew it. They totally blew it. They started spending like a bunch of drunken sailors on shore leave.\u201d Though times have changed, Salmon acknowledged that \u201cthis isn\u2019t his first rodeo\u201d and working on Capitol Hill is  familiar to him. An example: His new office has the same phone number as his first, and his congressional pin \u201clooks almost exactly like\u201d the one he received on his first day of Congress. Now, Salmon said, it\u2019s time to get back to the principles he felt were successful during his first stint in Congress. \u201cWhat I would really like to do is get back to the point where we are on message about what really is ailing America,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cThere was a time when Republicans and Democrats truly were working together.\u201d 113th Congress: More diverse than ever",

            "article_content": "NEW: Turner Field will be demolished, area will be redeveloped, mayor says The Atlanta Braves vow to leave Turner Field in 2017, moving to Cobb County County reportedly offers $450 million in public money to move the team 12 miles north Mayor: Keeping the franchise may have required $150 million to $250 million in city funds The Atlanta Braves have decided to leave the limits of their namesake city because they got \u201ca terrific deal,\u201d Mayor Kasim Reed said \u2013 one that was sweeter than he felt comfortable supporting for fear of hurting his municipal government long-term. \u201cWe wanted the Braves to stay in Atlanta, but (there was a) business problem that we had to solve,\u201d Reed said Tuesday.  \u201cThat choice was encumbering between $150 million and $250 million in debt and not having money to do anything else.\u201d The mayor chose not to go that route, and partly as a result, the Major League Baseball franchise is heading about 12 miles north to Cobb County. This new multimillion-dollar stadium, which will be part of a larger retail and entertainment complex, is scheduled to open in 2017 to the northwest, where two major interstates \u2013 Interstates 75 and 285 \u2013 meet, the Braves announced Monday. Atlanta Mayor: Cost too high Historical sports sites A day later, Reed admitted that he was taken aback by the news. While the team and city had been engaged in negotiations over the past 18 months \u2013 and he\u2019d \u201cstill felt that we could get a deal done\u201d \u2013 the mayor said his first indication that something had changed came after being contacted by a Braves official on November 6, a day after his re-election. Reed said he learned about the baseball club\u2019s new thinking, including a reported offer of $450 million of public financing from Cobb County, the next day. The city of Atlanta wasn\u2019t asked to put up that much money, nor was it asked to build a new stadium, the mayor said. Still, the Braves did ask for extensive public investments in the publicly owned stadium and the surrounding area, money that Reed said he didn\u2019t feel the city could give now, given other needs and the desire to keep spending and debt in check. The mayor pointed specifically to a $922 million infrastructure backlog and desires to upgrade roads, expand public spaces and pursue other improvements across the city. \u201cIf we made a different decision,\u201d Reed said, \u201cevery single dollar for everything else would have gone to fund and modernize the stadium.\u201d Critics have pointed out that, in recent months, city money has been allocated for another stadium in downtown Atlanta: $200 million for a new home for the NFL\u2019s Atlanta Falcons. Reed took pains to state that the two stadium deals \u201ccandidly are not close.\u201d The Falcons\u2019 one uses revenue from the city\u2019s hotel-motel tax but doesn\u2019t tap the government\u2019s general fund, as a Braves stadium deal might have done. Plus, the mayor added, \u201cI certainly was not going to try to finance two stadium deals at the exact same time.\u201d The team\u2019s contract with Turner Field, which was retrofitted for baseball after the 1996 Olympics, expires in 2016. Club President John Schuerholz said in a video message that Turner Field needs \u201chundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades. Unfortunately, that massive investment would not do anything to improve access or the fan experience.\u201d He vowed that the new stadium site \u201cwill be one of the most magnificent in all of baseball. It will thrive with action 365 days a year.\u201d The surrounding area will be a \u201cmixed-use destination,\u201d he said. As to what will then happen with the Braves\u2019 current home, Reed says it will be demolished to make way for \u201cone of the largest developments for middle-class people that the city of Atlanta has ever had.\u201d The mayor pointed out that it wasn\u2019t like the Braves were leaving the region altogether, insisting that they are and will remain his favorite team. And he credited Cobb County officials with stepping up to make a strong offer. \u201c$450 million in public financing is a pretty good deal,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe can\u2019t spend money that liberally in the city of Atlanta. We are fiscal conservatives here.\u201d 8 short-lived sports venues CNN\u2019s Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.",

Jake Tapper, host of \u201cThe Lead\u201d and CNN\u2019s chief Washington correspondent, is the author of the best-selling book, \u201cThe Outpost: An Untold Story of American Valor.\u201d Staff Sgt. Ty Carter survived the 2009 battle at Combat Outpost Keating His heroic efforts to save his fellow soldiers earned him the Medal of Honor He will receive the award Monday at the White House For more on Ty Carter, watch \"An Unlikely Hero\" on CNN Wednesday at 10 p.m. When Spc.Ty Carter first arrived in Afghanistan, he took one look at his surroundings and thought, \u201cThis is a death trap.\u201d He would soon learn just how right he was. Combat Outpost Keating was a sitting target for nearby Taliban insurgents:  It sat deep within a valley, surrounded by mountains. The American soldiers stationed there knew it was only a matter of time before something bad happened.  \u201cWe just didn\u2019t know when,\u201d Carter said. When it did, the assault would set in motion a chaotic chain of events that had every soldier certain he would not make it out alive. Eight American soldiers died on October 3, 2009.  Many of the 45 others who survived, including Carter, struggle with the guilt that they couldn\u2019t save more lives. Yet Carter\u2019s daring efforts to rescue his fellow soldiers in the face of imminent death earned him the nation\u2019s highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, which he will receive on Monday at a White House ceremony. Now Staff Sgt. Ty Carter, 33, will join another survivor of that battle, former Army Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha, who received the award earlier this year.  It marks the first time in nearly half a century that two living soldiers from the same battle received the Medal of Honor. To Carter, it\u2019s a bittersweet award. \u201cIt just brings back all those memories of what he had to go through,\u201d explained his wife, Shannon Derby. Discharged from the Marines Carter was a loner as a teenager.  He didn\u2019t have a lot of friends.  His older brother Seth had a knack for getting into trouble, and Ty followed in his footsteps for awhile before his mother kicked Seth out of the house. Not exactly hero material, he says. Carter joined the Marines in 1998, spending five years in the service until a fight with a roommate led to his demotion.  Two months later, he was honorably discharged. So, it was back to civilian life, something that left Carter restless and bored.  He bounced across the country from job to job: more than a dozen stints in five years, everything from a yacht repairman to a tow-truck operator. He was supporting his daughter after his first marriage ended.  But in every job, something was always missing. \u201cThere was no motivation, there was no purpose,\u201d Carter said.  \u201cIt felt like I was a drone.\u201d He hated the punch-in-punch-out lifestyle of making ends meet, and fondly recalled military life. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Well man, back in the service \u2026 I was doing what I enjoyed and I was actually happy to wake up in the morning, happy to go to work,\u2019\u201d he said. So he enlisted in the Army in 2008.  But military life wasn\u2019t the idyllic place he remembered. \u201cWe had a platoon full of guys that were on a lighter side of life (who) liked to joke around,\u201d retired Sgt. 1st Class Jonathan Hill recalled.  \u201cAnd Carter never really got involved \u2026 he thought it was immature. \u201cCarter really didn\u2019t make friends with a lot of guys, and he struggled with it.\u201d A little over a year after he enlisted, Carter and his platoon were deployed to eastern Afghanistan in May 2009. Despite his aloofness toward his fellow soldiers, Carter would find himself in a situation where he didn\u2019t think twice to risk his life for those men whose jokes he once found childish. Defining moment Combat Outpost Keating had been built in Nuristan province in 2006 as part of the effort by NATO-led forces to build partnerships with local Afghans, and try to stop insurgents from trickling over in nearby Pakistan. The camp had experienced ups and downs since that time and by 2008, the cavalry commanders in charge of the outpost thought it made sense to shut it down. Yet there were other factors at play. Afghanistan\u2019s President Hamid Karzai was in the middle of his re-election campaign in  fall  2009, and abandoning  Combat Outpost Keating might have been seen as a lack of American support. So, despite numerous warnings, Gen. Stanley McChrystal \u2013 then commander of all U.S. troops in Afghanistan \u2013 kept the outpost open. After Karzai\u2019s victory and the end of a military operation that freed some key assets, the military leadership approved a plan to abandon the outpost and the troops stationed there were to start packing up on October 4, 2009. That never happened. Instead, a day before their planned departure, an assault was unleashed on the outpost that culminated in what has now been described as one of the most intense battles of the entire war in Afghanistan. The first shots rang out just a few minutes before 6 a.m.  The rumors that the soldiers had heard for months were coming true.  Carter said he had often imagined that day. \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, if it\u2019s my time to go, how am I going out?\u2019 \u201d he said. The Taliban had studied how the Americans responded to previous attacks, and they knew the outpost relied heavily on its mortars. So they made the big guns their first target. \u201cWhen the enemy weren\u2019t shooting at us, they were shooting at the weapons,\u201d Carter said.  \u201cSo they were disabling the weapons.\u201d The insurgent fire killed Pfc. Kevin Thomson as he raced to his post.  Sgt. Josh Kirk was killed while returning fire. \u201cYou could hear the rounds coming in from every direction,\u201d said platoon Sgt. Jon Hill. Troops begin running much-needed ammunition to the men on guard duty.  Sgt. Michael Scusa was gunned down 10 feet outside one of the outpost\u2019s doors.  In the midst of the gunfire, Sgt. Christopher Griffin \u201cimmediately ran out the door without hesitation,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make it back\u201d Ammunition was starting to run out, so Ty Carter and other members of his Black Knight troop volunteered to deliver more \u2013 a hundred yards away across the heaviest of gunfire. Carter didn\u2019t think twice about the danger.  All he knew was there were three fellow soldiers \u2013 Sgt. Bradley Larson, Spc. Stephan Mace and Sgt. Justin Gallegos \u2013 trapped in a Humvee and they needed more supplies to return fire. \u201cCarter\u2019s kinda like .. for lack of a better word, a robot,\u201d Hill said.   \u201cYou tell him to do something, he\u2019s gonna do it and he\u2019s gonna do it to the best of his ability.\u201d He would return through that deadly gauntlet three times to get supplies to the men. When the firefight was over, the death toll would include Mace, Gallegos, Sgt. Josh Hardt, and Staff Sgt. Vernon Martin. The names of all eight men who died on that day are engraved on a steel band that Carter wears on his wrist, not that he needs the reminder. Read more about the battle from Jake Tapper\u2019s \u201cThe Outpost\u201d Farm life Today, Carter still struggles with the memories of the battle, seeking solace with his wife and three children on their farm in Washington state near Joint Base Lewis-McChord, where he is now stationed. In the dark, quiet moments, the constant ringing in his head brings back difficult thoughts. Photos: Staff Sgt. Ty Carter \u201cThat\u2019s when the memories start kicking in and you can\u2019t sleep because, you know, the whole, \u2018I shoulda done this, I coulda done that,\u2019 \u201d he said.  \u201cAnd then you see the faces of the soldiers that died.\u201d Carter said he believes that one more name should be added to the death toll of the battle of Kamesh:  Ed Faulkner Jr., who struggled with drug abuse and mental problems after surviving the battle. He left the army with severe PTSD and died in September 2010 after a fatal overdose of methadone and Xanax. While there was no evidence of a suicide, Faulkner\u2019s friends \u2013 including Carter \u2013 believe his death was linked to the battle. \u201cI honestly believe that, yes, he was the ninth victim of Combat Outpost Keating,\u201d Carter said.  \u201cAnd I also believe that he won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Carter also struggles with PTSD, and now has regular therapy. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it was real until I experienced it,\u201d he said of PTSD.  \u201cI thought it was just an excuse to get out of duty \u2026 but once it hit me, and I realized it, I was blown away.  How could I be so ignorant?\u201d Carter wants to be a voice to destigmatize these invisible wounds of war, and he hopes that the attention he receives with the Medal of Honor will show that there is nothing weak in seeking help. \u201cWhat we need to do is take the first few steps,\u201d Carter said.  \u201cWe need to realize that yes, this is affecting me, and I need to fix this.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Marrapodi, Jennifer Rizzo and Andy Segal contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "By Diane Ravitch, Special to CNN Editor\u2019s note: Diane Ravitch was assistant secretary of education in the administration of George H.W. Bush. She is a historian of education and is now a research professor at New York University.\u00a0 She is the author of several books on education, including her latest \u201cThe Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 She blogs daily at\u00a0dianeravitch.net and can be followed on Twitter at @DianeRavitch. Schools of Thought will be publishing other views on this topic in the days up to the election. (CNN) \u2013 Over the past three years, I have been an outspoken critic of the education policies of the Obama administration. In my view, Race to the Top is a disastrous program that is almost indistinguishable from the Bush administration\u2019s failed No Child Left Behind legislation. Both programs require teaching to the test, both encourage privatization of our public schools, and both have demoralized the nation\u2019s educators while doing nothing to improve education. But as bad as the Obama education policies are, they are tolerable in comparison to what Mitt Romney plans. Romney claims credit for the academic successes of Massachusetts, but he had nothing to do with the gains in that state, which were enacted 10 years before he became governor. The Massachusetts education reforms doubled the budget for public schools, increased spending on early childhood education, and raised standards for new teachers, but Romney intends to do none of that if elected President. If elected president, Romney will curtail spending on everything except privatization of public education. He will lower standards for entering the teaching profession. His policies will devastate our public schools and dismantle the education profession. He supports charters and vouchers and welcomes the takeover of public schools by for-profit entrepreneurs. Unlike the Massachusetts reforms that he wrongly takes credit for, he offers not a single idea to improve public education. Romney nowhere acknowledges that free public education is a public responsibility and an essential institution in a democratic society. Under a Romney administration, I fear not only for the future of public education but for the future of our society. Presently, nearly 25% of American children are growing up in poverty. We lead the advanced nations of the world in child poverty. Romney offers no proposals to reduce that scandalous number. Only government action can make a dent in a problem of that magnitude, but Romney believes in private charity, not government action. What frightens me most about the Romney-Ryan ticket is the Republican Party\u2019s rigid ideology. There have been times in recent history when moderate Republicans were in the ascendancy in the party. Today, the moderates are gone; the GOP is dominated by radical anti-government ideologues. The party seems determined to roll back the social policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society and to bring our society back to the 1920s. We know what followed the free-market exhilaration of the 1920s. If Romney has the chance to select one or two or three Supreme Court justices, then women\u2019s rights, voting rights, and the rights of minorities will be imperiled. We can anticipate that a Romney Supreme Court would favor the rights of multinational corporations over consumers and individuals. One shudders to imagine what will happen to our environment, to our water and air, if its protection is turned over to those who deny the reality of climate change and who despise regulation. We can expect that our precious resources of parks, beaches, and oceans will be handed over to private enterprise to mine for profit\u2014theirs, not ours. What of the millions of jobs that Romney promises to create? Romney\u2019s private company was known for outsourcing well-paying middle-class jobs to low-wage nations. In the debates, he has expressed admiration for trickle-down economics, his belief that whatever helps the rich and powerful will eventually create jobs further down the food chain. We can expect that jobs of the future created by a Romney administration will be for retail clerks, fast food servers, operators in call centers, and home health aides, none paying the kinds of salaries that lift families into the middle class. Romney has made clear that he will not pay for early childhood education, despite the fact that an independent survey by The Economist magazine ranked the U.S. 24th in the world in taking care of its youngest citizens.\u00a0 His education platform says that he will not expand any federal aid to college students now drowning in debt. Nor will he increase support for prenatal care for indigent women, even though a survey by the March of Dimes reported last spring that the U.S. ranked 131st among 180 nations in protecting the health of pregnant women; in that respect, we rank shamefully alongside Somalia. A Romney administration promises a society in which life is very sweet for those at the very top, but hard, mean, and brutish for the growing number of Americans falling out of the middle class and into poverty. Every successful nation in the world has taken positive steps to reduce income inequality, to reduce poverty, and to protect the environment in which we all live. I cannot support a candidate who promises to shred the safety net for our most vulnerable citizens. I cannot support a candidate who wants to reward those who are richest and to deny government support to those who need help to survive. I do not want to turn the clock back almost a century. That is why I will vote to re-elect President Obama. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Diane Ravitch.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story contains references to potentially offensive language reportedly used by politicians during the 2012 campaign. Taking stock, President Barack Obama realized he had unexpected strong suit George W. Bush made barnyard reference to Rick Perry Romney campaign got blunt advice from Chris Christie Some Republicans hoped late entry into race could replace Romney \u201cDouble Down,\u201d a behind-the-scenes account of the 2012 presidential race by the journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, is out Tuesday. It\u2019s the sequel to \u201cGame Change,\u201d their 2008 campaign retrospective that became an HBO film by the same name. The authors, self-styled ringmasters of Washington\u2019s political media \u201cFreak Show,\u201d are skilled at creating buzz, packing their book with provocative tidbits and a range of splashy scoops \u2013 an impressive feat considering that the Barack Obama-Mitt Romney showdown was the most scrutinized national campaign in American history. Read Peter Hamby\u2019s review in the Washington Post The book has already made headlines: The Obama campaign flirted with the idea of kicking Vice President Joe Biden off the ticket and replacing him with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Romney campaign was startled by what it dug up on Chris Christie in the process of vetting him to be the Republican vice presidential nominee. Ann Coulter: I don\u2019t believe Hillary story But here are 10 other newsmaking items from the book that has Washington transfixed: Why wasn't Christie on Romney's ticket? Obama on Clinton: I like him... in doses Was Biden nearly bumped from 2012 ticket? 1. Obama: \u2018I\u2019m really good at killing people\u2019 In late 2011, President Obama, \u201can inveterate list maker,\u201d began writing up a list of his achievements on a yellow legal pad. Writing his thoughts down on paper \u201chelped him to quiet his mind.\u201d The purpose was to help himself and his advisers reason through the best ways to present his three-year track record to voters. On September 30, the same day a Predator drone strike killed the American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, Obama presented a small stack of yellow legal pages to his aides gathered in the White House\u2019s Roosevelt Room. \u201cObama didn\u2019t need to run through this preamble,\u201d the authors write. \u201cEveryone knew the litany of his achievements. Foremost on that day, with the fresh news about al-Awlaki, it seemed the president was pondering the drone program that he had expanded so dramatically and with such lethal results, as well as the death of bin Laden, which was still resonating worldwide months later. \u201d \u2018Turns out I\u2019m really good at killing people,\u2019 Obama said quietly. \u2018Didn\u2019t know that was going to be a strong suit of mine.\u2019 \u201c Bergen: Did Obama keep his drone promises? 2. Obama\u2019s secret George Soros summit Obama\u2019s distaste for the ring-kissing demands of campaign fundraising is the stuff of legend among Democrats, so it\u2019s no surprise that a meeting with liberal megadonor George Soros in 2010 came up empty. In September 2010, the White House arranged \u201ca secret summit\u201d between the president and Soros at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, \u201cin hope that Soros would be induced into serious check-writing on behalf of the Democrats ahead of the midterms.\u201d Soros lectured Obama for 45 minutes on the economy. Obama, the authors write, \u201cwas annoyed and bored.\u201d Biden off 2012 ticket? NYT: Joe Biden dodged a bullet in 2012 \u201cAfterwards, he fumed, \u2018If we don\u2019t get anything out of him, I\u2019m never f\u2013king sitting with that guy again.\u2019 \u201c As for Soros, the hedge-fund titan declined to pony up in any big way for the midterms. 3. George W. Bush called Rick Perry \u2018chicken-s\u2013t\u2019 After Texas Gov. Rick Perry jumped into the Republican presidential race, long-standing tensions between him and the Bush family began to burst into view. Perry wasn\u2019t shy about criticizing the patrician roots of George W. Bush, his gubernatorial predecessor in Texas. Longtime Bush adviser Karl Rove, who thought Perry was unelectable, fired back at Perry Publicly, the Bush clan claimed not to be offended by the sudden rise of Perry. But privately, Barbara Bush \u201cwas hyperventilating over Perry\u201d up in Kennebunkport, Maine. And her son \u201cwas steaming.\u201d \u201cAt a dinner party in Washington, the 43rd president vented to a Romney ally. \u201cYou can\u2019t take Perry seriously,\u201d Bush said, according to the authors. \u201cHe\u2019s a chicken-s\u2013t guy.\u201d 4. Chris Christie on Newt Gingrich: \u2018He\u2019s a joke\u2019 After the once-fading Newt Gingrich returned with gusto in South Carolina and trounced Romney in the Republican primary, Romney\u2019s campaign was forced to recalibrate and develop a game plan to eliminate Gingrich in Florida. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey called Romney to give him some advice. \u201cGet out of your crouch and kick the s\u2013t out of this guy,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you should do. He\u2019s a joke. And you\u2019re allowing him to be taken seriously.\u201d Romney went on to trounce Gingrich in the Florida primary, drowning him in attack ads. A year after 2012 election, Romney talks 2016 5. The white-knight scenario In the darkest days of Romney\u2019s Republican nomination fight, facing down a surprisingly robust conservative challenge from former Sen. Rick Santorum before the Michigan primary, Haley Barbour was alarmed. The former Mississippi governor, one of the Republican Party\u2019s most well-connected and well-respected insiders, worried that Romney was so feeble as a candidate that he would be unelectable once the general election rolled around. So he consulted with Scott Reed, a veteran GOP fixer, about the \u201cwhite-knight scenario\u201d \u2013 recruiting a stronger candidate who could seize the nomination with a late entry into the race and a brokered convention in Tampa, Florida. Reed began investigating filing deadlines and ballot access rules for late primary states, circulating the details to Republican grandees around Washington. House Speaker John Boehner \u201cwas warm to the notion.\u201d And Barbour went even further. In Washington, he sat down with Christie and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels \u2013 two Republicans who had declined previous entreaties to enter the race \u2013 and asked them to reconsider. Both gave it serious thought but ultimately declined. 6. The Clinton ransom Keenly aware of Bill Clinton\u2019s popularity among Democrats and his comfort talking about middle-class issues, Obamaland worked overtime to get the 42nd president involved in the campaign. But it wouldn\u2019t come without a price. Clinton\u2019s then-gatekeeper, Doug Band, \u201cissued an ultimatum to the Obamans: the price of WJC\u2019s involvement in the campaign was the retirement of HRC\u2019s balance due.\u201d In other words, Band was demanding that Obama help pay off Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign debt \u2013 at that point, about a quarter of a million dollars \u2013 in exchange for Bill Clinton\u2019s help on the trail. Though top members of the Obama campaign were flabbergasted at the demand \u2013 and held Band in especially low regard, calling him a nickname unfit for printing here \u2013 they eventually agreed to help retire Clinton\u2019s debt. McCain: Hillary Clinton is \u2018formidable\u2019 candidate\u2019 7. The Ricketts plan The story landed like a hydrogen bomb: The New York Times reported in May 2011 that Republican billionaire Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder and Chicago Cubs co-owner, was proposing an eye-popping $10 million ad campaign designed to dredge up the 2008 controversy surrounding Obama\u2019s former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. The Obama campaign was furious that Republicans would consider playing the race card. But it turns out that Obamaworld was behind the story. The Ricketts plan, it seems, was anonymously dropped off at the Chicago offices of Democratic direct-mail vendor Pete Giangreco by \u201ca mystery brunette\u201d carrying a manila envelope. Just who leaked it remains a mystery, Halperin and Heilemann write. Giangreco promptly rushed over to Obama\u2019s Michigan Avenue headquarters to hand off the document to Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. Obama high command then decided to slip the Ricketts plan to the media, in hopes of killing it with negative publicity before it could even get off the ground. \u201cThe Obamans didn\u2019t want their fingerprints on the disclosure, so they used a third-party cutout to funnel the Ricketts document to The New York Times,\u201d the book reveals. It worked. All hell broke loose, and the Obama rapid response operation had a field day prodding reporters to get Romney to disavow the proposed ad campaign and anything related to Wright. 8. The Eastwood \u2018car crash\u2019 Clint Eastwood\u2019s rambling, incoherent, off-the-cuff speech-turned-performance-art appearance at the Republican National Convention caused heads to explode backstage. Once Russ Schriefer, the campaign\u2019s point person for convention planning, began to wrap his head around the scale of the disaster before him, \u201che was in a state of panic.\u201d \u201cRushing backstage to the control room to try to give Eastwood the hook, he ran into [Romney adviser Stuart] Stevens \u2013 who started screaming, \u2018This is terrible! It\u2019s a car crash!\u2019 \u201c According to the authors, \u201cStevens lost all control. He was throwing things, howling, cursing, and weeping, until he dropped his head into his hands.\u201d Stevens also excused himself, made his way to another room, and vomited. 9. \u2018Project Goldfish\u2019 Romney\u2019s search for a running mate began in April 2012 with about two dozen names compiled by his longtime adviser Beth Myers, who presided over the vice presidential search, code-named \u201cProject Goldfish\u201d after the snack food. Presented with the initial list, Romney narrowed his possible choices down to 11 Republicans: New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, former Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. After sorting through \u201cpreliminary research\u201d on each of them, the Republican nominee drilled down on five final choices: Christie, Pawlenty, Portman, Rubio and Ryan. In keeping with the \u201cProject Goldfish\u201d theme, each potential running mate was given a code name. Christie\u2019s was \u201cPufferfish.\u201d Once a larger group of advisers were brought into the process, \u201cthe overwhelming consensus\u201d was for Ryan, who was eventually picked. Romney adviser Stevens, though, was \u201cadamantly in favor of Christie.\u201d But Romney and Myers ultimately concluded, based on research compiled by attorneys on the vetting team, that Christie\u2019s background was \u201clittered with potential landmines\u201d \u2013 and they pulled the plug on Christie. 10. The Huntsman debacle Among the GOP cast of characters, no one emerges more sullied than Jon Huntsman, whose shameless ambition wilts under the grueling spotlight of a national campaign and clashes with his own staff. As Obama\u2019s ambassador to China, Huntsman apparently circumvented the Hatch Act \u2013 which prohibits high-ranking U.S. officials from engaging in partisan political activity \u2013 by using his wife, Mary Kaye, as a back channel to plot embryonic campaign strategy with John Weaver, his adviser-in-waiting back in the States. In the fall of 2010, the authors write, \u201cMary Kaye began e-mailing Weaver and asking about 2012. Sometimes two or three times a day the missives hit his inbox: What\u2019s the state of the race? Who\u2019s in? What do you think? She referred to her husband as \u201cHE,\u201d a code that probably would not have provided much protection had the communications been exposed.\u201d Once a candidate, Huntsman and his family were taken aback by the drudgery of campaigning, particularly fundraising. They were also mortified by the fire-breathing anger of the tea party. Instead, the Huntsmans were \u201clike candle-drawn moths to the liberal glitterati,\u201d cozying up to New York celebrities like Tina Brown, Arianna Huffington and Diane Von Furstenberg who \u2018made them swoon.\u2019 \u201c Mired in low single digits in national polls, Huntsman also decided at one point to abandon his Republican bid and run as an independent, but he was talked out of it by his family.",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama says conservative Republicans holding the country hostage The GOP-led House passes a spending plan that defunds Obamacare Obama and Democrats reject the measure, setting up a budget showdown Without a new spending resolution, the government shuts down starting October 1 With one vote on Friday, the Republican-led House launched the latest spending battle in Congress \u2013 one that could bring a government shutdown in less than two weeks. By a 230-189 tally almost strictly on party lines, the House passed a short-term government spending plan that would eliminate all funding for Obamacare. The measure now goes to the Democratic-led Senate, which is certain to reject the provision that defunds President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement of his first term. Even though House Republicans now have voted 42 times to repeal or otherwise undermine Obamacare, Speaker John Boehner and fellow Republicans held a brief victory rally after Friday\u2019s action and challenged the Senate to follow their lead. Obama: GOP efforts could be 'destructive' How would a shutdown affect you? Peter King: Ted Cruz 'is a fraud' Stopping a government shutdown Obamacare fight exposes GOP rifts Photos: The last government shutdown \u201cThe American people don\u2019t want the government shut down, and they don\u2019t want Obamacare,\u201d the Ohio Republican said to applause and cheers. \u201cThe House has listened to the American people. Now it\u2019s time for the United States Senate to listen to them as well.\u201d In a display of the raw politics of the battle, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia called out  Senate Democrats facing re-election next year by name, asking how Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska and Kay Hagan of North Carolina will vote on the House proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Senate Democrats to follow House Republicans and show some responsibility,\u201d Cantor said. Later Friday, Obama accused conservative Republicans of holding the nation hostage by trying to make passing a federal budget and increasing the debt ceiling contingent on defunding health care reforms. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to threaten to blow the whole thing up if you don\u2019t get your way,\u201d Obama said in a campaign-style speech at a Ford plant in the Kansas City, Missouri area, adding that legislators in Washington were focused on politics and \u201ctrying to mess with me,\u201d rather than helping the middle class. In legislative jargon, the House passed a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded for the first 11 weeks of the fiscal year that begins October 1. Without some kind of spending measure by then, parts of the government would have to curtail services or shut down. Government shutdown: Again? Seriously? Conservatives tie Obamacare to budget talks The controversy involves the provision demanded by the GOP\u2019s conservative wing and agreed to by Boehner that eliminates all funding for the 2010 health care reforms popularly known as Obamacare. Approval by the House set in motion a Capitol Hill showdown that will continue through October, when the nation\u2019s debt ceiling must be increased so the government can pay all its bills. The two-stage process includes the possible government shutdown at the end of the current fiscal year on September 30 if there is no compromise on a spending resolution, followed by a potentially even more rancorous debate over raising the debt ceiling. Cantor said Friday the House would consider a one-year debt ceiling measure next week that contains other conservative-backed proposals, expected to include postponing implementation of Obamacare for a year and approving the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada. Obama, however, rejected playing politics with the debt ceiling, which is the limit for how much the federal government can borrow to pay bills it owes. \u201cThis is not a deadbeat nation. We don\u2019t run out on our tab,\u201d the president said, calling even the threat of not raising the debt ceiling \u201cthe height of irresponsibility.\u201d He also made a point of telling the auto workers that raising the debt ceiling \u201cdoesn\u2019t cost a dime\u201d and \u201cdoes not add a penny to our deficits.\u201d \u201cAll it says is, you gotta pay for what Congress already said we\u2019re spending money on,\u201d Obama said, adding that \u201cif you don\u2019t do it, we could have another financial crisis.\u201d Tea party conservatives who have pledged to fight implementation of Obamacare consider the current budget debate their last major chance to undermine it, because the brunt of the new system takes effect with the start of fiscal year 2014 on October 1. They demand a halt to funding all programs from the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and they seem indifferent about forcing a government shutdown if that doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cI will do everything necessary and anything possible to defund Obamacare,\u201d Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said Thursday, threatening a filibuster and \u201cany procedural means necessary.\u201d However, more moderate Republicans in the Democratic-led Senate call the defunding effort a waste of time. Veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona told CNN on Thursday that because of the chamber\u2019s Democratic majority, \u201cwe will not repeal or defund Obamacare\u201d in the Senate \u201cand to think we can is not rational.\u201d In addition, the White House said Thursday that Obama would veto the House spending resolution defunding Obamacare if it reaches his desk. An earlier compromise proposed by Boehner and fellow GOP House leaders to their conservative wing would have allowed a symbolic vote on the defunding provision that the Senate would then strip out. The result would have been what legislators call a \u201cclean\u201d final version that simply extended current levels of government spending for about two months of the new fiscal year, allowing time for further negotiations on the debt ceiling. Worries about Obamacare? Fear not However, conservative opposition to the compromise made Boehner agree to a tougher version that made overall government funding contingent on eliminating money for Obamacare. Moderate Republicans question the strategy, but fear a right-wing backlash in the 2014 primaries if they go against the conservative wing. In reference to the divisions in the House, McCain said it is \u201cpretty obvious that (Boehner) has great difficulties within his own conference.\u201d On the House floor on Friday, legislators warned of the serious consequences of a government shutdown. The last shutdown, which occurred during the Clinton administration more than 17 years ago, comprised a total of 28 days and cost the nation more than $1 billion, according to congressional researchers. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said the intent of the Republican measure is to shut down the government, calling it a \u201cwolf in wolf\u2019s clothing.\u201d GOP Rep. Harold Rogers of Kentucky, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said \u201ca government shutdown is a political game in which everyone loses.\u201d \u201cIt shirks one of our most basic duties as members of Congress and it puts our national security at stake,\u201d he added. Opinion: The real problem with Obamacare Republicans said the House vote showed bipartisan support for defunding Obamacare because two Democrats backed the GOP resolution \u2013 Reps. Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina. Meanwhile, Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia was the lone Republican to break ranks with his caucus by voting against it. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made clear on Thursday that any plan to defund Obamacare would be dead on arrival. Instead, the Senate is expected to strip the measure of all provisions defunding Obamacare and send it back to the House. \u201cThey\u2019re simply postponing an inevitable choice they must face,\u201d Reid said of House Republicans. Boehner would then have to decide whether to put it to a vote, even though that could undermine his already weakened leadership position by having the measure pass with only a few dozen moderate Republicans joining Democrats in support. If he refuses to bring the Senate version to the floor for a vote, a shutdown would ensue. \u201cWill he act as the captain of the entire House of Representatives or remain a captive of his right wing Republican mates?\u201d asked Democratic Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan. \u201cWill he, as he acts, worry mainly about the risk to his speakership or the risk to our entire nation? House Republicans taking the ship over the cliff would take the nation\u2019s economic well-being with it.\u201d Polls showing a decrease in public support for the health care reforms embolden the Republican stance. Meanwhile, Democratic resolve is bolstered by surveys showing most people oppose a government shutdown and more would blame Republicans if it happens. House GOP: defund Obamacare or shut government down Shutdown scenario Voices across the political spectrum warn against a shutdown, including Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Republican strategist Karl Rove. \u201cEven the defund strategy\u2019s authors say they don\u2019t want a government shutdown. But their approach means we\u2019ll get one,\u201d Rove argued in an op-ed published Thursday by the Wall Street Journal.

            "article_content": "Mayoral race will mark the end of Bloomberg's decade of control of mayor's office Disgraced former U.S. Rep. Andrew Weiner is running a distant fourth in Democratic race Biggest question on Tuesday will be whether front-runner can avoid runoff It\u2019s primary day in New York City, where a whole lot of Democrats and not that many Republicans will select their nominees for mayor and a slate of other city offices. Given the city\u2019s liberal bent, the primary serves as a de facto general election. Most of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic winners will sail to victory in November against token Republican opposition. But New York hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic mayor since 1989, when David Dinkins became the city\u2019s first African-American mayor. This is shaping up to be the year that streak ends. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has presided over more than a decade of economic expansion in the city, but his tenure has left a sour taste in the mouths of rank-and-file Democrats, who say the mayor cares more about wealthy Manhattan elites than the outer borough middle class. The issues flaring this election season all seem to come back to Bloomberg: affordable housing, income inequality, education, a city council vote that handed the mayor a third term, and the controversial New York Police Department tactic known as stop-and-frisk. Nixon: De Blasio 'a real game changer' Anthony Weiner campaign's final days Race for mayor of New York City Quinn: Weiner's actions immature Bloomberg fatigue is the prime reason that Bill de Blasio, the city\u2019s public advocate, has surged into the lead in a crowded field of underwhelming Democratic candidates. De Blasio is promising a \u201cclean break\u201d from the Bloomberg years. He\u2019s running as an unabashed liberal, pledging to raise taxes on the wealthy and end stop-and-frisk. De Blasio, who is white, also happens to be leading his opponents among African-American voters, in part because of his telegenic mixed-race family, which has been at his side throughout the campaign. Polls suggest De Blasio is certain to win Tuesday\u2019s primary. The main question is whether he can run up the score high enough to avoid a runoff against one of his two main challengers: City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, a lesbian who would be New York\u2019s first female mayor, and Bill Thompson, the city\u2019s former comptroller. Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, whose campaign imploded in July after he admitted to sending another round of lewd online chats well after he resigned from Congress, is running in a distant fourth place. Here are five things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s election, which will also determine whether former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer can make a political comeback after a prostitution scandal forced him from office five years ago: 1. Can de Blasio avoid a runoff? De Blasio was handed a big fat gift over the weekend when New York Magazine posted a buzzy new interview with Bloomberg in which the mayor described de Blasio\u2019s campaign, which has showcased his interracial family in a bid to win African-American support, as \u201cracist.\u201d The New York City Public Advocate promptly put his family in front of television news cameras to hit back against the mayor, who has steadfastly backed the NYPD\u2019s stop-and-frisk policy, a deeply unpopular practice in the city\u2019s black community. A former political operative and onetime city councilman from Brooklyn, de Blasio was already surging before the comments hit the Web on Saturday morning. Now de Blasio might be able to reach the crucial 40% threshold needed to avoid a three-week runoff campaign, a once unthinkable scenario given the number of Democrats in the race. A Marist poll released Monday by NBC 4 New York and the Wall Street Journal pegged de Blasio\u2019s support among Democrats at 36%. With all the political wind in the race at his back, it\u2019s possible he might win the nomination outright on Tuesday. 2. Where do African-American voters go? The most influential person in the mayor\u2019s race isn\u2019t even on the ballot. That would be de Blasio\u2019s 15-year old son Dante, who starred in a memorable television ad that vaulted his father to the top of the polls in August. He hasn\u2019t looked back since. In the ad, Dante, who boasts an impressive Afro, looks into the camera and pledges that his father is \u201cthe only Democrat with the guts to really break from the Bloomberg years\u201d and \u201cend a stop-and-frisk era that unfairly targets people of color.\u201d The Dante spot, produced by former Obama campaign media consultant John del Cecato, sparked one of the most intriguing developments of the primary: de Blasio has steadily been growing his support among African-American voters \u2013 even against Bill Thompson, the lone black candidate in the field. De Blasio now leads Thompson among black voters by a 39-25 margin, the Marist poll showed. He\u2019s also identified as the candidate most likely to end stop-and-frisk. Thompson was the 2009 Democratic nominee for mayor and bucked conventional wisdom \u2013 and many polls \u2013 by coming within five points of defeating Bloomberg that November. If Thompson is to have any chance of making the runoff and beating de Blasio, he better hope the polls are wrong again. 3. Chelsea and the Village Quinn\u2019s city council district encompasses Chelsea and stretches of Greenwich Village, which represent the historic heart of New York City\u2019s gay and lesbian community. The Moonstruck Diner, on the corner of 23rd Street and Ninth Avenue, serves as Quinn\u2019s second office. Last Friday evening, Quinn rallied hundreds of gay and lesbian supporters outside the Stonewall Inn, site of the historic 1969 gay rights demonstrations against the New York Police Department. But disgruntled Quinn supporters have faulted her for not drawing more attention to the history-making nature of her candidacy. Quinn, once the front-runner, now desperately needs her West Side base to show up if she has any hope of making a runoff. There are hints her support could be fracturing under the weight of her complicated relationship with Bloomberg in the city council, and de Blasio\u2019s late burst of momentum. When de Blasio showed up late last week to campaign in Quinn\u2019s backyard, on the corner of 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue, he was mobbed by photo-seeking supporters and held court for nearly an hour, jamming up foot traffic and putting the City Council speaker on notice. On Monday night, Quinn\u2019s campaign added a last-minute campaign swing through Chelsea to shore up her base. 4. Can Spitzer make a comeback? Spitzer, who resigned from office in a 2008 prostitution scandal that roiled Albany, surprised pretty much everyone in politics in July when he suddenly jumped into the Democratic race for city comptroller, the city\u2019s chief fiscal officer. With the help of his real estate fortune, his unabashed anti-Wall Street rhetoric and his near universal name recognition, Spitzer led his Democratic primary opponent, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, for most of the summer. But Stringer has worked overtime to remind voters of Spitzer\u2019s baggage, attacking him in debates, in the mail and on the television airwaves. Spitzer has returned fire, accusing Stringer of being a lifelong member of the political establishment who accomplished little during his public career. The race is the most intriguing head-to-head match-up on Tuesday. Recent polls paint a mixed picture but suggest the race is something of a toss-up, though Spitzer may have a slight edge thanks to his steady 2-1 edge among African-American voters. If he wins the nomination, he\u2019s a sure bet to become comptroller against nominal Republican opposition and see his name bandied about as a potential future mayor, attorney general or governor. A win Tuesday would be his first step toward political redemption. 5. The end of \u201cCats\u201d The Republican primary contest has been largely overlooked given the city\u2019s Democratic leanings. Roughly 700,000 Democrats are expected to cast ballots in Tuesday\u2019s primary, while Republican turnout may be as low as 60,000. Joe Lhota, a fedora-wearing veteran of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s administration, is expected to win the GOP nod. If the liberal de Blasio wins the Democratic primary as expected, Lhota might have an outside shot in the general election if he\u2019s able to enlist Bloomberg allies and the business community, no fans of de Blasio\u2019s tax-the-rich agenda, to help defeat him. But a Lhota win would also be the political death knell for John Catsimatidis, arguably the most colorful figure of the 2013 election cycle. Catsimatidis, the Greek-born billionaire founder of the Gristedes grocery store chain and a longtime Republican donor, poured millions of dollars of his own money into the race, blanketing the television airwaves with quirky television ads. According to The New York Times, \u201cHe has even created his own eight-page newspaper, The Cats Chronicle, which includes no fewer than 27 photographs of Mr. Catsimatidis.\u201d Politically incorrect, often disheveled and definitely overweight, Catsimatidis has some regular guy appeal but is nevertheless prone to missteps and cringe-worthy statements that make him hard to take seriously. He even fell asleep in the middle of an interview with a New York public radio reporter, who recorded him snoring and used the sound in her story. Russell Schaffer, a New York Democrat who tweets prolifically under the handle @RussOnPolitics, spoke for political junkies everywhere on Sunday when he mourned Catsimatidis\u2019 imminent demise: \u201cI\u2019ll never let @JCats2013 go, even after he loses the GOP primary for NYC mayor on Tuesday,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHe is a treasure to behold and quote.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trio of disgraced politicians show that voters have gotten more forgiving Disgraced former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer is latest to announce comeback bid Political strategist says shorter turnaround reflects voters lower opinions of politicians Others say Americans have always been forgiving and avoid appearing judgmental Politics is full of second chances. Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford \u2013 now U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford \u2013 is living proof. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner is trying to travel the same road to political redemption. And now add former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer to the list, as he embarks on a similar journey. Six wives who stood by their men ...  and four who didn't In this age of lighting fast news cycles and fleeting memories, are disgraced politicians sitting in the penalty box for a shorter time before launching a comeback? Spitzer's comeback after sex scandal Eliot Spitzer: I want to serve A Republican political strategist thinks it reflects a lower opinion of politicians. \u201cThe required waiting time has been greatly condensed in recent years, indicating present voters are holding elected officials to a much lower standard then previous generations,\u201d said John Brabender, a longtime top political adviser to 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Sen. Rick Santorum. Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 after revelations he spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes, launched a petition campaign Monday to become New York City comptroller. \u201cI made significant errors. I stood up, accepted responsibility, resigned. It\u2019s now been five years, I hope the public will extend its forgiveness to me,\u201d the Democrat said Monday morning on radio\u2019s \u201cThe Bill Press Show.\u201d \u201cI think it is a land of forgiveness, of people in their natural goodness (who) understand the fact that\u2026we sin, we pay a price and hopefully continue,\u201d added Spitzer, who served two terms as New York State attorney general before winning election as governor in 2006. Spitzer, who needs to gather the 3,750 signatures by Thursday to get into the September primary ballot, would be on the same Democratic ballot as Weiner, who is running for mayor and would have the quickest redemption. Opinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace Weiner would have the shortest time in time-out should he be elected. He was in his seventh term in Congress, representing parts of the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, when he resigned from the House in 2011 amid scandal over lewd photos sent via Twitter. He talked about getting another chance in the video announcing his candidacy, saying, \u201cI made some big mistakes, and I know I let a lot of people down. But I\u2019ve also learned some tough lessons. I\u2019m running for mayor because I\u2019ve been fighting for the middle class and those struggling my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you.\u201d 2011: Eliot Spitzer signs off Anthony Weiner winning back New Yorkers Spitzer, who since stepping down has been a commentator for various news outlets including CNN, disagrees with the Weiner comparison, and said he\u2019s not on a quest for redemption, but instead stressed that he\u2019s motivated by what he said are personal pleas from New Yorkers urging him to get back into public service. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I want, then I don\u2019t think this is the path to it. What I am seeking is service,\u201d he said on CBS \u201cThis Morning.\u201d Republican Sanford\u2019s political career appeared dead after he finished out his term amid repercussions of admitting to an extramarital affair in 2009. But he won redemption in a special election in May to fill a vacant congressional seat in the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which he represented before serving as governor. Opinion: New York\u2019s sex scandal candidates The media loves a comeback story, if only because it allows them it an opportunity to revisit what brought down that politician in the first place. And redemption stories resonate with the public. \u201cVoters love a good comeback story \u2013 we identify with the underdog and cheer for him as we would for ourselves,\u201d said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \u201cBut voters also love justice. We want people to pay for their mistakes.\u201d Share your views on Spitzer and Weiner Brabender said votes have increasingly shown they are willing to forgive indiscretions. \u201cIt all comes down to how well the scandal is handled, voters assessment of relevance to doing the job, and choosing the right time for re-entry into the political arena,\u201d he said. Spitzer to run against madam Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala says faster news cycles and fleeting memories may be behind this year\u2019s trio of comeback bids, \u201cbut it may also be a result of a very healthy American aversion to being too judgmental.\u201d \u201cIt used to be an iron law of politics that no divorced person could be president. Then Ronald Reagan proved that wrong,\u201d said Begala, who was a top political adviser to President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser last year to a super PAC that worked for President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election. \u201cUltimately politics is about voters\u2019 lives, not politicians \u2013 if voters think someone can make a difference in their life, they will overlook personal shortcomings,\u201d he added.  \u201cBut the key is not to make the campaign about the politician\u2019s need for redemption, but about voters\u2019 need for jobs.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Ed Payne and Adam Reiss contributed to this story",

            "article_content": "Dole says that in his time, lawmakers were able to work out their differences 1996 GOP presidential candidate says neither party is looking for middle ground now Dole blames Republicans and Democrats equally for a lack of trust Old friends and staff members will gather Tuesday for a birthday celebration Robert Dole knew his share of Washington fights \u2013 as the Republican vice presidential and presidential nominee and as both Senate majority and minority leader. But as he celebrates his 90th birthday on Monday, he told CNN he believes the tone in Washington is much more bitter \u2013 and that is not helping the country. \u201cThere were a lot of differences in the days I was in the Senate,\u201d he told CNN in a rare interview. \u201cBut in every case we were able to work the out the differences.\u201d Dole served in the Senate alongside several Democratic leaders who were known for their strong wills: Robert Byrd, George Mitchell and Tom Daschle. \u201cWe disagreed, but we respected each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never had an unkind word about each other.\u201d Now as Dole looks at today\u2019s Congress he thinks the two parties are not doing enough to try to find a middle ground \u2013 and that includes relying too much on the filibuster in the Senate. \u201cIt is very frustrating. Sometimes it is just justified, don\u2019t misunderstand me. But most of the time you ought to be able to work out a compromise that is going to be voted on,\u201d Dole told CNN. \u201cCompromise has become a bad word, and I always thought in almost every case there is room for compromise.\u201d Senate leaders should change how they use the filibuster, he said. \u201cThere are things that should be stopped, but at least there ought to be a vote,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can\u2019t continue, this constant holding up bills.\u201d As for what else is causing some of the rancor today, he told CNN \u201cthe biggest problem today is the lack of trust.\u201d Asked who is to blame for that, he put responsibility on both parties \u2013 \u201cSometimes it is the Rs (Republicans). Sometimes it is the Ds (Democrats).\u201d Just last week Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, threatened a historic change regarding the rules of how presidential nominations are considered \u2013 eliminate the ability to filibuster them if Republicans didn\u2019t allow votes on several of the president\u2019s picks.  If those changes would have gone into effect, the atmosphere in Washington would have deteriorated even more. But even the threat of the rules change created a war of words between Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. This week the Senate is expected to consider a bipartisan compromise to help cap student loan rates \u2013 a politically popular idea. But senators were able to reach agreement only after weeks of partisan haggling, several failed attempts and the intervention of President Barack Obama. Dole also sees major problems in how far his party has shifted to the right, saying a moderate from a conservative state will face problems because of \u201csome who don\u2019t believe they are Republican enough.\u201d He repeated a statement he originally made in May in a television interview as a sign of how rigid the party has become, saying, \u201cthat is why I said that Ronald Reagan I doubt could be nominated today. And I was a conservative and supported Reagan.\u201d Dole, who was the GOP\u2019s 1996 presidential nominee, losing to incumbent Bill Clinton, urged his party to do a better job of trying to be more inclusive. In 2012: Dole, Baker for embracing bipartisan politics \u201cI believe we ought to be reaching out to the Hispanic community, the black community and of course the middle- and upper-class community across the board, and we haven\u2019t done that,\u201d he said, pointing to the last election as evidence. After having served eight years in the House of Representatives, he began his first term in the Senate in 1969 and served there until 1996, when he resigned to concentrate on his run for the presidency after capturing the Republican nomination. He was Gerald Ford\u2019s running mate in 1976 when Ford lost to Jimmy Carter. Since his time in Congress the Kansan native, the longest-serving Republican leader in the Senate,  has seen a dramatic change in those serving and their goals. \u201cA lot of the younger members \u2013 they are very smart. They are very capable. They have their own ideas \u2013 start a filibuster, rather than compromise.\u201d He cited how food stamps was added to the farm bill in the past as key to attracting support for the measure in both parties. The House earlier this month passed a scaled-down farm bill without food stamps after a version including them was defeated because it could not attract a large enough coalition. Dole, who is disabled from a World War II injury, also was disappointed last December after some of some of his own personal lobbying failed. The Senate blocked ratification of a United Nations treaty to promote the rights of disabled people. Dole, in a wheelchair, came to the Senate floor in a last ditch effort to help the treaty gain support. As for his successes, he cited the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act as one of the bills he was most proud of because of its lasting impact and one that had bipartisan support. He was also a major fundraiser in helping get the World War II Memorial built on the National Mall. Dole, who is special counsel in the Washington law firm of Alston & Bird\u2019s legislative and public policy group, spends his time with his wife, former Sen. Elizabeth Dole, in Washington but is mostly out of public view. He is a co-founder of the Bipartisan Policy Center and works to support a political institute named in in his honor at the University of Kansas. Dole has suffered from several illnesses in recent years, and spent 11 months at Walter Reed Army Hospital in 2010 after a bout with pneumonia. President George W. Bush appointed Dole in 2007 to a panel investigating conditions at the hospital. \u201cI never really thought I wanted to spend that much time there,\u201d he joked at a 2011 appearance honoring the 50th anniversary of his being first elected to Congress. Asked about the milestone of his 90th birthday, Dole said \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a special day. I don\u2019t know how many people reach 90,\u201d adding \u201cI am kind of excited about it.\u201d Many friends and old staff members will gather Tuesday for a party celebrating his special day.",

Anthony Weiner said he wants to be mayor of New york City Weiner resigned in disgrace after tweeting intimate photos He is one of a number of politicians who have sought public redemption Politics is full of second chances. Mark Sanford is living proof. Now Anthony Weiner is hoping to travel the same route in seeking political redemption. Weiner was in his seventh term in Congress, representing parts of the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, when he resigned from the House in 2011 amid scandal over lewd photos sent via Twitter. Weiner talked about his controversy in a video that went up online early Wednesday where he announced his candidacy for mayor of New York City. \u201cLook, I made some big mistakes, and I know I let a lot of people down. But I\u2019ve also learned some tough lessons. I\u2019m running for mayor because I\u2019ve been fighting for the middle class and those struggling my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you.\u201d Anthony Weiner running for NYC mayor Weiner's confessional interview The politics of forgiveness The video also features his wife, Huma Abedin, a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton, and their young son. Later in the video, Abedin says \u201cwe love this city, and no one will work harder to make it better than Anthony.\u201d Sound familiar? Flash back a few months to Mark Sanford, another well-known politician looking for a second chance. Sanford\u2019s political career was left for dead following an infamous affair, but he made a bid for political redemption, running in a special election to fill a vacant congressional seat. Sanford succeeded in his comeback by winning this month\u2019s election and is again representing South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District, a seat he once held before he became governor. Sanford talked about his affair in his first campaign commercial. Most special elections for a vacant House seat don\u2019t grab national attention, but thanks to Sanford (and his Democratic opponent being the sister of Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert), the race was in the headlines. The media loves a comeback story, if only because it allows them an opportunity to revisit what brought down that politician in the first place. So Weiner, like Sanford, will be in the spotlight, for better or for worse. \u201cVoters love a good comeback story. We identify with the underdog and cheer for him as we would for ourselves,\u201d says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \u201cBut voters also love justice. We want people to pay for their mistakes. Anthony Weiner hasn\u2019t yet paid for his. He probably will in this election. But who knows?\u201d \u201cAnthony was of the most talented politicians in either party, and this race is going to be steep climb for any of the candidates. Anthony definitely has a shot,\u201d says a Democratic strategist who\u2019s worked in New York City politics. \u201cWhen you have someone as skillful as a messenger as Anthony, that makes a big difference in a race where TV ad spending is limited due to New York City election laws and the fact that it\u2019s the most expensive media market in county,\u201d adds the strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely. The big question is what the voters think. As of now, nearly half of New York City voters don\u2019t think Weiner should run for mayor this year, according to a new poll. According to a Quinnipiac University survey, which was conducted in the week before Weiner\u2019s announcement and released Wednesday, 49% of New York City voters said Weiner should not run for mayor, with 38% saying he should make a bid and 12% unsure. The 49% figure is up five percentage points from a Quinnipiac poll conducted in mid-April. The survey indicates Democratic voters are divided, with 41% saying Weiner should run and 44% disagreeing. But Weiner\u2019s entry into the race finds him in the second spot for his party\u2019s nomination, according to the poll, with 15% of registered Democrats saying they would vote for Weiner if the primary were held today. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn remains in the top spot, at 25%. Quinn has long been the Democratic front-runner in the race, and if she\u2019s elected in the November general election, she\u2019ll become Gotham\u2019s first female and first openly gay mayor. The other Democratic candidates are at 10% or less in the survey, with more than a quarter of voters undecided. The poll also indicates that at this stage in the campaign, the eventual Democratic nominee would be the front-runner in the November election.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rob Portman reverses course, now supports same-sex marriage Portman said he had \"change of heart\" when he learned his son was gay Senator has long been respected in Washington as budget, tax expert Campaigned hard for Mitt Romney, but couldn't deliver Ohio in 2012 for GOP When Rob Portman signed on to the Mitt Romney campaign in January 2012, he was seen as a key supporter \u2013 a rising star in the Republican Party, a swing state campaigner and a staunch conservative who could protect Romney on the right. For the next 11 months, Portman zipped around the country, pitching the candidate he said was \u201cexactly what our nation needs.\u201d The Ohio senator\u2019s hard-nosed approach landed him on Romney\u2019s vice presidential short list. He was even vetted for the job. The Romney campaign was undoubtedly the height of Portman\u2019s political career. After he failed to deliver his state and Romney lost the election, Portman stepped out of the limelight and remained relatively quiet on Capitol Hill as President Barack Obama settled in for a second term. Until Friday. GOP Sen. Portman supporting gay marriage Portman: 'Love, support' for gay son Sen. Portman told Romney his son was gay That\u2019s when Portman, a former White House budget director, was thrust into the divisive national debate when he publicly acknowledged that he had changed his mind on same-sex marriage. \u201cI\u2019m announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples\u2019 opportunity to marry,\u201d Portman told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash two years after learning his son, Will, was gay. Will Portman \u2018especially proud\u2019 of father \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that for me, personally, I think this is something that we should allow people to do, to get married, and to have the joy and stability of marriage that I\u2019ve had for over 26 years. That I want all of my children to have, including our son, who is gay,\u201d Portman said. Portman is an unexpected advocate for same-sex marriage \u2013 and he admitted as much in the interview. \u201cWhat happened to me is really personal,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI mean, I hadn\u2019t thought a lot about this issue. Again, my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career.\u201d Even though he is seen as a social conservative, someone whose social policy is deeply rooted in his Christian faith, Portman is noticeably out of his comfort zone in this discussion. It is budget and tax issues, not marriage and sexuality, that he is better known for. Portman was first elected to the Senate in 2010 after receiving little challenge from Democrat Lee Fisher for a seat vacated by Republican George Voinovich. While there, he has pushed fiscal issues, including a balanced budget amendment. This focus tracks with Portman\u2019s past. His first foray into elected office was when he won a House seat in 1993, representing Ohio\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Portman stirs mixed reaction with same-sex marriage reversal In that role, he began to hone his expertise on budget and fiscal issues. During his 12 years in the House, Portman sat on the Ways and Means and Budget committees \u2013 two powerful budget and tax-writing panels \u2013 and co-chaired the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. His expertise was noticed by the George W. Bush White House. Bush made Portman the U.S. trade representative in 2005 and he became the Republican president\u2019s budget director the next year. The job required Portman to dive into the esoteric world of federal spending. On his website, Portman describes himself as \u201ca deficit hawk\u201d that proposed \u201ca balanced budget,\u201d fought \u201cirresponsible earmarks\u201d and advocated for more transparency. Not everyone agrees with that assessment, however. Portman was only at the budget office for a year where he worked with the White House on its fiscal 2008 budget \u2013 a document that led to a deficit of $459 billion. When Portman was rumored as a possible vice presidential candidate for Romney, nearly all Democratic operatives attacked him for his time as Bush\u2019s top budget deputy. Many said he portrayed himself as a deficit hawk, but didn\u2019t live up to those ideals when he worked for the White House. Greg Schultz, the Ohio state director for Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, stressed these critiques in a blog post for the campaign. \u201cAs one of the architects of the top-down Bush budget, Portman practically invented the policies that punished middle-class families while exploding the deficit, and crashing our economy,\u201d Schultz wrote. Portman, in the middle of the presidential campaign, even tried to distance himself from the Bush administration. \u201cI was frustrated when I was there about some spending issues \u2014 specifically, as you know, I wanted to offer a balanced budget over five years, and a lot of people didn\u2019t,\u201d Portman said in an interview with the Hill Magazine. \u201cI prevailed. The president sent his budget \u2014 not my budget, his budget \u2014 a five-year balanced budget. But it was a fight, internally.\u201d",

Not the president\u2019s new personal outreach to Congress, including a 90-minute meeting Wednesday with House Republicans. And not even white smoke from the Vatican chimney that signaled selection of a new pope as the talks occurred. \u201cYou are straining the analogy,\u201d Obama told reporters afterward when asked if the meeting produced any similar message of spiritual significance. Leaders on both sides acknowledged the deep differences between them on a day when congressional committees began considering separate spending proposals for 2014 to launch the formal budget process. Rep. Price: GOP budget 'a better way' King: Ryan budget 'good blueprint' Paul Ryan introduces GOP budget plan Gergen: Give Obama credit for reaching out In an interview broadcast Wednesday on ABC, Obama warned that compromise may prove unattainable. \u201cRight now what I\u2019m trying to do is create an atmosphere where Democrats and Republicans can go ahead and get together and try to get something done,\u201d he said of his so-called charm offensive that has included a dinner with GOP senators, lunch with House leaders and meetings with others legislators. \u201cBut ultimately it may be that the differences are just too wide.\u201d Opinion: Ryan budget is a firing offense House Speaker John Boehner labeled Obama\u2019s visit to the Capitol on Wednesday \u201cproductive\u201d because it allowed both sides to understand the \u201cvery real differences\u201d between the parties. \u201cRepublicans want to balance the budget. The president doesn\u2019t,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cRepublicans want to solve our long-term debt problem. The president doesn\u2019t. We want to unlock our energy resources to put more Americans back to work. The president doesn\u2019t.\u201d He then came to either his punch line or understated conclusion: \u201cBut having said that, today was a good start, and I hope that these kinds of discussions can continue.\u201d Earlier, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan also recognized the challenge, telling the panel\u2019s first meeting on his proposed budget for next year that Congress faced a tough negotiation. \u201cWe are hoping that at the end of the day, we\u2019re still talking to each other and we can make a down payment\u201d on balancing the federal budget, said Ryan, R-Wisconsin. On the Senate side, Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray made her own joking reference to the papal decision as the panel began considering the first full Democratic spending plan in recent years. \u201cI understand we have a new pope and a committee hearing to mark up a budget.  That\u2019s history twice, so it\u2019s good,\u201d said Murray, D-Washington. Turning serious, she added that  \u201cthis process is not going to be easy\u201d because of \u201ca serious difference of opinion about what our government  should be doing to keep our economy and our national finances moving in the right direction.\u201d The proposal by Senate Democrats called for a mix of increased tax revenue and spending cuts to reduce deficits by about $1.9 trillion over 10 years. House GOP, Obama meet face to face but don\u2019t see eye to eye It would increase revenue by about $975 billion by eliminating and curtailing tax breaks and loopholes for wealthy Americans and corporations. It would also cut spending by an estimated $975 billion: $493 billion in domestic spending; $240 billion in defense spending; and $242 billion in interest savings. The proposal included a $100 billion economic stimulus package for road and bridge repairs, as well as worker training, that Murray said would be paid for by curtailing tax breaks for high-income households and corporations. However, the Senate plan avoided significant changes to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which are major drivers of federal deficits. Republican leaders oppose new tax hikes or revenue and demand substantial overhauls of entitlement programs, setting up another in the litany of congressional impasses of recent years. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that Obama\u2019s new outreach was intended to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d on a deficit reduction plan that would include reforms of the tax system and popular entitlement programs. Obama will introduce his own budget proposal next month, and the president and Democrats concede their approaches would not eliminate annual deficits, as sought by Republicans, but instead reduce them to what they say are manageable levels. Republicans call such an approach inadequate, insisting that government has become too large and costly to ensure needed economic growth. Ryan proposed a conservative budget  for fiscal year 2014, which begins on October 1. He said it would eliminate the annual deficit in a decade without raising taxes. It calls for cutting $5 trillion from projected spending increases in the next 10 years while lowering tax rates and getting rid of most of Obama\u2019s signature legislation of his first term \u2013 the 2010 health care reform law. Ryan also revived his proposal to reform Medicare, the health care program for senior citizens that is considered the biggest driver of rising federal deficits as costs increase and more Americans become eligible. The idea was a major issue in last year\u2019s presidential election, in which Ryan was the vice presidential candidate on the GOP ticket that lost to Obama. It calls for offering senior citizens a choice between traditional fee-for-service Medicare and a premium support system that would provide a fixed government payment to help them buy private health insurance. The plan would take effect in 2024 to exempt people 55 and older today. Carney shoots down notion that Obama\u2019s charm offensive is fake Both sides reverted to harsh rhetoric from last year\u2019s election campaign in defending their deeply entrenched positions on Wednesday. Ryan referred to \u201cjob-killing tax increases\u201d pushed by Obama and Democrats, saying his push for less government and lower tax rates would benefit economic growth. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying, like we said before, is we can hit these same revenue numbers without killing jobs,\u201d he contended, adding that budgets were all about priorities and choices. Democrats responded that the Ryan proposal would harm economic growth by shifting the burden of deficit reduction to middle-class Americans, the elderly and others, while cutting spending for college loans, infrastructure development, scientific research and other areas vital for job creation. \u201cIt is not consistent with American values. It is not fiscally responsible,\u201d argued Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Florida. What\u2019s in Paul Ryan\u2019s budget In the ABC interview, Obama took aim at the choices in Ryan\u2019s budget plan. \u201cIf you look at what Paul Ryan does to balance the budget, it means that you have to \u2018voucherize\u2019 Medicare, you have to slash deeply into programs like Medicaid, you\u2019ve essentially got to either tax middle-class families a lot higher than you currently are or you can\u2019t lower rates the way he\u2019s promised,\u201d the president said. Carney slams notion that charm offensive is fake For his part, Ryan noted that while his side lost last year\u2019s election, his 2014 budget plan adhered to GOP principles that the party believes will set the country on the right path to growth and prosperity. However, he sounded contradictory when challenged by reporters Tuesday about his call to eliminate most of Obama\u2019s health care reform law. After first saying \u201cwe are not going to re-fight the past\u201d and that \u201claw is law\u201d with regard to the measure known as Obamacare, Ryan later said that \u201cwe need to repeal and replace Obamacare with a better system.\u201d Republicans led by their conservative base seek to shrink the size and cost of government, opposing any new tax revenue while pushing for spending cuts and lower tax rates that they say will spur more economic growth. After agreeing in January to allow tax rates on top income earners to return to higher levels of the 1990s, Republican leaders say they oppose any further steps to raise taxes. Obama and Democrats say they want to protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, and that comprehensive deficit reduction must include increased taxes on wealthy Americans to prevent the burden of austerity steps from shifting too much to the middle class, the elderly and other vulnerable demographics. Obama dismisses balancing budget for \u2018sake of balance\u2019 By clearly staking out positions in their budget proposals, Obama and Congress appear intent on trying to avoid the crisis-driven brinksmanship of the past four years. However, the familiar, partisan nature of the budget plans illuminated the continuing political division that the public blames for legislative dysfunction. A CBS News poll last week showed more than 70% of respondents want both sides to compromise to end the brinksmanship over taxes and spending that dominated Obama\u2019s first term. During the past four years, House Republicans pushed through partisan budgets that Senate Democrats ignored, forcing the repeated extension of past spending plans. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: 2014 wars begin over Medicare, budget Meanwhile, the president\u2019s budget proposals generated little support in Congress. The upcoming negotiations are complicated by lingering fiscal issues from past showdowns. Deep cuts to military and other discretionary spending took effect this month, and both sides were expected to try to soften their impact through a separate funding measure for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. Called a continuing resolution, it must pass by March 27 to prevent a partial government shutdown. The Republican-led House passed its version last week, and the Democrat-led Senate took up its own version this week. Congress also must authorize an increase in the federal borrowing limit this summer, and Republicans have made clear they intend to leverage that moment to try to extract concessions. A comprehensive deficit-reduction deal appeared close during Obama\u2019s first term, but eventually fell apart over taxes. Obama and Democrats want to eliminate tax breaks and loopholes worth about $600 billion over 10 years as part of a broader $1.2 trillion deficit-reduction package that would include entitlement reforms. Some Republicans have indicated support for ending such tax breaks as part of a broad deal. However, the fiscal-cliff agreement in January that resulted in higher tax rates on top income earners galvanized opposition by GOP leaders to further increases in tax revenue. The rich pay majority of U.S. income taxes Meanwhile, Republicans say Obama and Democrats must deliver on significant entitlement reforms. One change Obama has proposed would tighten the adjustment for inflation of benefits such as Social Security, meaning annual increases for future recipients would grow at a slower pace. Opponents of the reform, known as \u201cchained CPI\u201d in reference to the Consumer Price Index it involves, argue it hurts senior citizens and others who most need their benefits. If achieved, a grand bargain would give Obama a major political victory and a boost in cementing his desired presidential legacy after the controversial health care and Wall Street reforms of his first term. Republicans also would get credit from moderates and independents for a willingness to compromise, but conservatives could punish them with primary challenges in 2014 and beyond. Another possible outcome is a limited agreement that would include some elements under discussion. For example, a smaller agreement might end some tax breaks and loopholes while cutting Medicare costs paid to providers, not beneficiaries, to achieve $500 billion or so in deficit reduction over 10 years. Such a result, coupled with previous spending cuts and the January fiscal-cliff deal, would fail to reach the total $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade that economists and political leaders have targeted as the minimum amount needed. It also would allow both parties to simultaneously claim credit for making some progress while continuing to blame the other for preventing more. A status quo outcome \u2013 no major deficit reduction steps \u2013 would mean continued brinksmanship over each pending fiscal deadline, as well as further economic uncertainty that already has lowered the U.S. credit rating and slowed growth.

            "article_content": "Partisan rhetoric resumes in Washington despite hopes for compromise House Budget Chairman Ryan proposes an austerity budget for 2014 NEW: President Barack Obama, in interview, rejects the Ryan proposal Obama visits Capitol Hill to continue his outreach to legislators Despite a ballyhooed charm offensive by President Barack Obama, political leaders continued talking past each other on Tuesday in proposing partisan ideas on taxes and spending that have zero chance of winning congressional approval. Obama met with Senate Democrats in the first of three visits to Capitol Hill this week for face time with legislators from both parties. The rare personal appearances by the president, a former senator, follow his newly unveiled outreach efforts that included dinner with Senate Republicans and lunch with two influential House members last week, as well as phone calls to various legislators from both parties. Obama offered no comment to reporters when entering and departing Tuesday\u2019s meeting with senators, while White House spokesman Jay Carney rejected any inference that the meetings and phone calls by the president were just for show. What\u2019s in Paul Ryan\u2019s budget Democratic senators who met with Obama described him as upbeat and supportive. Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan said Obama called compromise with Republicans essential, but added that the president acknowledged \u201che hasn\u2019t seen enough from them yet.\u201d Another participant, Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, said Obama stayed longer than expected to answer \u201cabout a dozen questions\u201d on fiscal issues and other topics, noting that he \u201cobviously wanted to be there.\u201d The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said he welcomed Obama\u2019s efforts, adding: \u201cI think having more of that rather than less of that is a good idea.\u201d Democratic senators who met with Obama on Tuesday described the president as upbeat and supportive. Whether symbolic or sincere, Obama\u2019s increased personal engagement came as Congress prepared for the first formal budget debate since the president took office four years ago. However, all signs Tuesday indicated the issues and rhetoric would be much the same as during the repeated political showdowns that marked the president\u2019s first term. Locked out: White House tours canceled Forced cuts are 'a win for nobody' House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan fired the opening salvo, introducing a conservative budget proposal for fiscal year 2014 that he said would eliminate the annual deficit in a decade without raising taxes. \u201cWe think we owe the country a balanced budget,\u201d Ryan told reporters. \u201cWe think we owe the country solutions to the big problems that are plaguing our nation \u2013 a debt crisis on the horizon, a slow growing economy, people trapped in poverty. We are showing our answers.\u201d Carney shoots down notion that Obama\u2019s charm offensive is fake The Wisconsin Republican\u2019s plan calls for cutting $5 trillion from projected spending increases in the next 10 years while lowering tax rates and getting rid of most of Obama\u2019s signature legislation of his first term \u2013 the 2010 health care reform law. Ryan also revived his controversial proposal to reform Medicare, the health care program for senior citizens that is considered the biggest driver of rising federal deficits as costs increase and more Americans become eligible.

It calls for offering senior citizens a choice between traditional fee-for-service Medicare and a premium support system that would provide a fixed government payment to help them buy private health insurance. The plan would take effect in 2024 to exempt people 55 and older today. Democratic rejection of much of Ryan\u2019s approach was swift with the White House saying that his math didn\u2019t add up, using language from policy debates of last year\u2019s election campaign. \u201cIf instead of asking the wealthiest to contribute to deficit reduction, you say we\u2019d like to give the wealthiest a huge tax cut, the result is that \u2026 the burden is doubled or tripled on everyone else and that just doesn\u2019t seem fair and it\u2019s also not good economics,\u201d presidential spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Obama followed up. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to balance the budget in 10 years,\u201d he said in an interview with ABC News. \u201cIf you look at what Paul Ryan does to balance the budget, it means that you have to \u2018voucherize\u2019 Medicare, you have to slash deeply into programs like Medicaid, you\u2019ve essentially got to either tax middle class families a lot higher than you currently are or you can\u2019t lower rates the way he\u2019s promised.\u201d Ryan takes on Obamacare \u2026 again Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, contended that Ryan\u2019s proposal was \u201ceven more extreme\u201d than Republican policies rejected by voters in the November election. For his part, Ryan noted that \u201cthe election didn\u2019t go our way,\u201d but asked whether that meant Republicans must surrender their principles. However, he sounded contradictory when challenged about his call to eliminate most of Obama\u2019s health care reform law. After first saying \u201cwe are not going to re-fight the past\u201d and that \u201claw is law\u201d with regard to the measure known as Obamacare, Ryan later said that \u201cwe need to repeal and replace Obamacare with a better system.\u201d Senate Democrats plan to make public their own 2014 budget proposal on Wednesday, and Reid confirmed it would call for an equal amount of increased tax revenue from wealthy Americans and spending cuts to help bring down deficits. After agreeing in January to allow rates on top income earners to return to higher levels of the 1990s, Republican leaders say they oppose any further tax increases or other measures to raise more tax revenue. Meanwhile, Carney told reporters to expect Obama to release his budget proposal during the week of April 8, which GOP critics quickly noted would be well after the House and Senate versions came out. Obama dismisses balancing budget for \u2018sake of balance\u2019 \u201cThis is the first time in 90 years that the president\u2019s budget will actually come up after both the House and Senate have voted,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s not a reflection of a lack of seriousness but it is beyond, beyond tardy.\u201d By clearly staking out positions in the formal budgeting process, Obama and Congress appear intent on trying to avoid the crisis-driven brinksmanship of the past four years that deepened Washington\u2019s defining political divide. However, the familiarly partisan nature of Ryan\u2019s plan unveiled Tuesday and the Democratic response raised doubts of any lessening of that divide, which the public blames for legislative dysfunction. A CBS News poll last week showed more than 70% of respondents want both sides to compromise to end the impasse over taxes and spending that dominated Obama\u2019s first term. During the past four years, House Republicans passed partisan budgets that Senate Democrats ignored, forcing the repeated extension of past spending plans.

The Republican-led House passed its version last week, and the Democratic-led Senate was expected to take up its own version as soon as Tuesday. Congress also must authorize an increase in the federal borrowing limit this summer. Obama still calls for a comprehensive deficit-reduction package that would overhaul the tax system, cut spending and reform popular entitlement programs. He and fellow Democrats insist that such an approach, labeled the grand bargain, must include increased tax revenue from wealthy Americans to prevent the burden of austerity steps in spending and entitlement reforms from hitting the middle class, the elderly and other vulnerable demographics too hard. \u201cMy goal is not to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance,\u201d Obama said in the ABC interview. \u201cMy goal is how do we grow the economy, put people back to work, and if we do that we are going to be bringing in more revenue.\u201d \u201cIf we control spending and we have a smart entitlement package, then potentially what you have is balance \u2014 but it is not balance on the backs of the poor, the elderly, students who need student loans, families that have disabled kids. That is not the right way to balance our budget,\u201d he added. Republicans led by their conservative base seek to shrink the size and cost of government, opposing any new tax revenue while pushing for spending cuts and lower tax rates that they say will spur more economic growth. A comprehensive deficit-reduction deal appeared close during Obama\u2019s first term, but eventually fell apart over the deep ideological differences regarding taxes. Such an agreement would reform the tax system to lower both personal and corporate rates while eliminating some loopholes and breaks. It also would reform Medicare and Medicaid and possibly Social Security to ensure their solvency. The major sticking point of a comprehensive agreement will be taxes. Obama and Democrats want to eliminate tax breaks and loopholes worth about $600 billion over 10 years as part of a broader $1.2 trillion deficit-reduction package that would include entitlement reforms. Some Republicans have indicated support for ending such tax breaks as part of a broad deal. However, the fiscal-cliff agreement in January that resulted in higher tax rates on top income earners galvanized opposition by GOP leaders to further increases in tax revenue. The rich pay majority of U.S. income taxes A sticking point in a possible compromise on taxes would be whether increased revenue realized through reforms, such as eliminating existing loopholes, go toward holding down rates or reducing the deficit. Meanwhile, Republicans say Obama and Democrats must deliver on significant entitlement reforms. \u201cDemocrats cannot be trusted to help fix our country\u2019s fiscal mess, if they cannot be trusted to balance the budget and create jobs,\u201d said a news release on Tuesday from the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThe choice is clear: Democrats\u2019 perpetual deficits or Republicans\u2019 plan to balance the budget and spur economic growth.\u201d One change Obama has proposed would tighten the adjustment for inflation of benefits such as Social Security, meaning annual increases for future recipients would grow at a slower pace. Opponents of the reform, known as \u201cchained CPI\u201d in reference to the consumer price index it involves, argue it hurts vulnerable senior citizens and others who most need their benefits.

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama signs order that is required by law \"We will get through this,\" President Obama says of the forced spending cuts Obama, congressional leaders fail to bridge gaps on cuts, letting them take effect Speaker Boehner says the House will take up a government funding measure Politics trumped progress on Friday as President Barack Obama and Republican leaders traded blame for $85 billion in forced spending cuts after they failed to come up with a compromise to avert the harshest impacts. The president signed an order required by law that set in motion the automatic, government-wide cuts. Obama and congressional leaders from both parties met for about 45 minutes at the White House, but no agreement emerged to avert the cuts that both sides oppose. After weeks of campaign-style events intended to inspire public outrage over the cuts, Obama sought to temper his description of their impact while making clear he thinks Republican intransigence prevented a deal to avoid the economic harm they\u2019ll cause. Cuts will ground military planes Forced spending cuts are here The impact of forced budget cuts How to define a devastating budget cut \u201cWe will get through this,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is not going to be an apocalypse as some people have said. It\u2019s just dumb and it\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d Full text of Obama order Still, a White House budget office report sent to Congress and released with Obama\u2019s order said the cuts would be \u201cdeeply destructive to national security, domestic investments, and core government functions.\u201d The action was described in the report as \u201ca blunt and indiscriminate instrument\u201d that was \u201cnever intended to be implemented and does not represent a responsible way\u201d for the country to realize deficit reduction. OMB report to Congress In a sign of the potential impact, the Department of Justice sent furlough notices to employees that warned they may be forced to take days off without pay in coming months. Similar furloughs, as well as reduced services, were expected at other agencies if the cuts don\u2019t get replaced or eliminated. Military leaders have warned of impaired readiness of U.S. forces. Shame and blame: Why Washington needs couples therapy However, the full impact of the cuts weren\u2019t expected until April at the earliest. The cuts amount to roughly 9% for a broad range of non-defense programs and 13% for the Pentagon over the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30. They were included in a 2011 deal to raise the federal borrowing limit as an unacceptable outcome if Congress failed to agree on a comprehensive deficit reduction plan. Obama\u2019s press conference on spending cuts However, election-year politics stymied progress on such a deal, leading to the situation Friday in which both sides acknowledged being unable to prevent something neither wanted. \u201cThere are smarter ways to cut spending,\u201d said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, after the meeting with Obama. Boehner repeated his past assertion that the GOP-led House has offered proposals to replace the forced spending cuts while the Democratic-led Senate has not, as well as his party\u2019s opposition to any increased tax revenue to offset the forced spending cuts. Others who also took part in the White House gathering were Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. In the White House briefing room, Obama told reporters that Republicans in Congress \u201callowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful (tax) loophole to help reduce the deficit.\u201d \u201cAs recently as yesterday, they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the well off and the well connected and they think that that\u2019s apparently more important than protecting our military or middle class families from the pain of these cuts,\u201d Obama said. He was referring to a procedural vote on Thursday in which Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic proposal that called for eliminating some tax loopholes as part of a package with spending cuts. Boehner and Republicans say the president and Democrats have yet to propose a serious plan to reduce spending, including costly entitlement programs, on a scale necessary to bring chronic federal deficits and debt under control. Both Obama and Boehner foreshadowed the next major spending showdown - a March 27 deadline for Congress to authorize funding to keep the government running for the rest of the fiscal year. 4 myths about the spending cuts Boehner told reporters that the House will take up a measure next week to authorize federal funding beyond that deadline. \u201cThe president and leaders agreed legislation should be enacted this month to prevent a government shutdown while we continue to work on a solution to replace the\u201d forced spending cuts, said a statement by Boehner\u2019s office. Although the funding measure is unconnected to the spending cuts, Obama indicated he was open to a broader agreement that would resolve both issues. \u201cI do know that there are Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that they would rather close tax loopholes then let these cuts go through,\u201d said Obama in response to questions from reporters. \u201c\u2026 In the coming days and the coming weeks, I\u2019m going to keeping on reaching out to them \u2013 both individually and as groups of senators or members of the House \u2013 and say to them, \u2018Let\u2019s fix this, not just for a month or two, but for years to come,\u2019 because the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business in month-to-month increments or by careening from crisis to crisis,\u201d Obama said.

The next political showdown is March 27 Democrats and Republicans trade blame over who is at fault Analyst: Americans want reduced spending without touching individual programs It\u2019s every clich\u00e9 about repeated experience you can think of \u2013 the myth of Sisyphus, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, Groundhog Day. The forced government spending cuts that take effect Friday are just a prelude for more political showdowns in coming months. First will be the March 27 deadline for Congress to approve government funding for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30. Without such authorization through what legislators call a continuing resolution, the government will partially shut down. So like Sisyphus and his stone or Phil Connors in Punxsutawney, the nation will again face the same political drama over spending and taxes less than four weeks from now. President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner made clear Friday that the coming deadline on the continuing resolution will be the next standoff. \u201cThe president and leaders agreed legislation should be enacted this month to prevent a government shutdown while we continue to work on a solution to replace the\u201d forced spending cuts, said a statement by Boehner\u2019s office. Obama indicated he would sign a funding bill to avert a possible government shutdown on March 27 as long as it adhered to past funding agreements, even if that included the forced spending cuts. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we should have another crisis by shutting the government down in addition to these arbitrary spending cuts,\u201d he said. At issue is the same ideological divide over the size and role of government that dominated Obama\u2019s first term and appears certain to also dominate the second one. Both sides acknowledge the need to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt, but they differ on the severity of the steps needed and how to make it happen. Republicans led by Boehner seek to shrink government to reduce overall spending, especially on costly entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that are main drivers of the deficits. They contend that failing to bring down spending threatens the nation\u2019s economic stability and security in the near-term and especially in coming decades. Democrats led by Obama want to preserve the social safety net of entitlements and insist on including more tax revenue \u2013especially from the wealthiest Americans \u2013 in any deficit reduction package. Obama made such an approach a central campaign theme in winning re-election last year, arguing Republican proposals that focus on spending cuts alone would put most of the burden of deficit reduction on the middle class, the elderly, the poor and disabled. A last-gasp effort to avoid the forced spending cuts taking effect Friday amounted to theatrical staging, with Obama and congressional leaders meeting for about 45 minutes at the White House after both sides insisted they wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cThere will be no last-minute, back-room deal and absolutely no agreement to increase taxes,\u201d Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement issued before the talks. For his part, Obama lamented that \u201cnone of this is necessary.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s happening because of a choice that Republicans in Congress have made,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful loophole to help reduce the deficit.\u201d Breaking the cycle of partisan posturing will require the White House and Congress to open themselves to substantive negotiations, Republican Rep. Randy Forbes of Virginia told CNN on Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s just way too much bravado up here, too much from White House, too much from Congress. We\u2019ve got to calm people down and have them starting talking to each other, instead of at each other.\u201d Polls show the public is about as politically divided as its leaders. While most Americans support a deficit reduction plan that includes spending cuts and increased revenue, as well as entitlement reforms, there is little agreement on the formula for such a package. In addition, a Pew Research Center poll last week showed that a majority of respondents opposed cuts to 18 of 19 specific areas, sending the message that people don\u2019t want deficit reduction to hurt them personally. \u201cThe American people want the federal government to reduce spending without touching actual programs,\u201d wrote William Galston a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, in a blog post this week. \u201cIs it any wonder that long-term budget cuts have stalled and that even short-term fiscal issues tie Congress up in knots?\u201d Part of the blame rests with political leaders in Congress and the White House failing to level with the American public about what it will take to \u201cwrestle the federal budget back on a sustainable trajectory for the long term,\u201d Galston wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that most of today\u2019s politicians regard the people with a mixture of fear and contempt: They can\u2019t stand the truth, and they\u2019ll punish any elected official who utters it,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen politicians come to believe this, or act as though they do, effective democratic self-government becomes impossible, and temporizing and pandering fill the vacuum the absence of serious governance creates.\u201d Such a vacuum exists now, judging by the repeated brinksmanship over tax and spending issues that caused a downgrade in the U.S. credit rating and threatened economic recovery. Teachers: How will you be affected? A series of showdowns has occurred since a conservative wave helped Republicans regain control of the House in the 2010 mid-term elections. Every deadline \u2013 for funding the government, raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit or addressing expiring taxes or tax cuts \u2013 led to protracted wrangling and last-minute agreements. William Gale, co-directorf of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and University of California-Berkeley Professor Alan Auerbach argued in a paper published Thursday that much more deficit reduction was needed than enacted in agreements so far. \u201cThe changes needed relate much more to medium- and long-term deficits, rather than the short-term deficits, which to a considerable extent still reflect the weakness of the economy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMoreover, cuts in discretionary spending alone will not suffice if substantial progress is to be made; changes to entitlement spending and to tax revenues will be needed to close the gap.\u201d One of those past agreements \u2013 to increase the debt ceiling in 2011\u2013 included the forced spending cuts taking effect Friday. Known in Washington jargon as sequestration, the cuts were intended to be so unpopular that both sides would be motivated to negotiate a broader deficit reduction package rather than let them get implemented. However, the charged political environment of an election year in 2012 prevented such an agreement, leading to the mandatory cuts to defense and other discretionary spending \u2013 but not entitlement programs \u2013 set to begin Friday. The next deadline is for the continuing resolution. Because that measure covers government spending for the rest of the fiscal year, it could address the forced spending cuts to resolve both problems. However, Obama indicated Friday that the comprehensive agreement he seeks \u201cmay take a couple of weeks, it may take a couple of months, but I\u2019m just going to keep on pushing on it.\u201d Or as absurdist philosopher Albert Camus wrote of the endless task faced by Sisyphus: \u201cThe struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man\u2019s heart.\u201d \u201cOne must imagine Sisyphus happy,\u201d Camus concluded.",

            "article_content": "Obama takes his case on sequestration to American people Emotional rhetoric aimed at inspiring public outrage at looming cuts Roughly $85 billion in government-wide cuts would be set in motion March 1 Congress must act to avert cuts, which would be phased in President Barack Obama stepped up pressure on Congress about the potential fallout from deep cuts in spending set to take effect on March 1, directing his emotional message squarely at the American people. Flanked by first responders whose jobs could be affected if the initial wave of $85 billion in cuts for this year goes forward, Obama argued on Tuesday that such drastic austerity could add hundreds of thousands of people to the unemployment lines and hurt the economy. What spending cuts would look like \u201cIf Congress allows this meat cleaver approach to take place, it will jeopardize our military readiness, it will eviscerate job-creating investments in education and energy and medical research,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt won\u2019t consider whether we\u2019re cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness or a vital service that Americans depend on every single day.\u201d Congress passive as spending cuts near John King explains: Spending cuts Bracing for forced spending cuts Barrasso: Spending cuts will go through The campaign-style event at the White House auditorium with Congress out of town for a week was an attempt by Obama to amplify his message for averting the cuts, known in Washington jargon as sequestration. His intention was to inspire public outrage at the potential new reality. The forced cuts aimed at deficit-reduction have been hanging over Washington since 2011. They were initially proposed by the White House and then approved by Congress as part of a deal to allow continued borrowing by the Treasury to pay the nation\u2019s bills. Opinion: Forced budget cuts a disaster for military The deal established a bipartisan committee tasked with presenting a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan to Congress by that November. That group - dubbed the \u201csuper committee\u201d - failed to reach any sort of agreement. The \u201ctough cuts\u201d that were designed to be so objectionable were set to take effect this past January \u2013 about $1 trillion over 10 years. Because that was also the date that the Bush-era tax cuts would expire, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke dubbed the combination the \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d The plan was to eventually negotiate a deal so the cuts would never be set in motion. Borger: Obama can\u2019t kick his legacy down the road Heading out of the 2012 election and into this year and with no deal in sight, the cliff loomed large. The rhetoric was heated and the political maneuvering fierce. Obama sought an agreement with congressional leadership and held events surrounded by middle class Americans, publicly announcing his desire for \u201ca big deal.\u201d But with a promise to increase taxes on wealthy Americans at the center of his re-election campaign, Obama focused most of his efforts on finding a tax compromise, rather than avoiding the looming spending cuts. Blind budget cuts, explained In an 11th-hour agreement on tax hikes for upper income Americans deferred the spending cuts for another two months. Now, that time is nearly up and Congress is no closer to a resolution. Over the past several weeks, Obama called for a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach to deficit reduction, one that includes tax reforms that increase government revenue. Obama, Republicans clash on forced spending cuts He also appealed to Congress for a smaller package of austerity and tax reforms \u201cthat would delay the economically damaging effects of the sequester for a few more months\u201d until lawmakers could find a \u201csmarter solution.\u201d Republican leaders insist any package must be comprised entirely of alternative spending reductions, including entitlement reform. Just like he did on the tax issue around the fiscal cliff, Obama will step up his efforts to get Congress to act to avoid the sequester cuts, White House officials tell CNN. The approach will mean more events like the one on Tuesday marked by emotional rhetoric and average Americans as backdrops. Obama plans to travel as well to highlight the impact of cuts on everyday Americans. By the Numbers: Automatic spending cuts",

            "article_content": "NEW: \"This works. We know it works,\" Obama says at preschool near Atlanta The president called for expanded early education in his State of the Union address It is the second of three straight days of events outside Washington to tout his proposals Obama and Republicans are in a fierce debate over government spending For a second straight day, President Barack Obama touted proposals from his State of the Union address at a campaign-style event outside of Washington, this time visiting a Georgia preschool where youngsters on a winter break showed up to mimic a regular day. Obama\u2019s visit to the College Heights Early Childhood Learning Center, in the city of Decatur just outside Atlanta, followed his call in Tuesday night\u2019s speech to Congress for investments in high-quality early childhood education programs. The president spent time in a classroom where he hugged some students \u2013 who told him they saw him on television \u2013 and praised the teachers he said were giving their students a boost into the educational system. \u201cThis isn\u2019t baby-sitting,\u201d he said. Children who take prekindergarten classes are more likely to read at their grade level, graduate from high school and hold a job down the road \u2013 but fewer than 30% of 4-year-olds are enrolled in prekindergarten programs like those at College Heights, he said. \u201cHope is found in what works. This works. We know it works,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are looking for a good bang for your educational buck, this is it right here. That\u2019s why, even in times of tight budgets, states like Georgia and Oklahoma have worked to make a preschool slot available for nearly every parent who is looking for one for their child.\u201d In the classroom, Obama sat in a small chair and helped children with tablet blocks at one table. He then moved to another to engage in a brief game of I Spy, peering at little faces through a magnifying glass. Will Obama's speech help bipartisanship? And he took a moment to warn the parents of the young children that \u201cthey grow up to be, like, 5\u201910\u201d \u2013 and even if they\u2019re still nice to you, they basically don\u2019t have a lot of time for you during the weekends.\u201d \u201cThey have sleepovers and dates,\u201d he said to laughter. \u201cSo all that early investment just leads them to go away.\u201d Friday, he will head to Chicago to continue his campaign for the main proposals of the State of the Union address, which emphasized themes of his re-election campaign last year, including equal opportunity and middle-class growth. On Wednesday, Obama toured an auto parts plant in Asheville, North Carolina, and urged Congress to support the jobs agenda in his address the night before. In Chicago, he\u2019ll speak about the economy and the city\u2019s rampant gun violence. Obama and congressional Democrats are locked in a fierce political debate with Republicans over government spending and federal deficits, with a showdown pending on mandatory spending cuts set to take effect March 1. In his State of the Union address and again Thursday, Obama said making an early commitment to education saves money later for local governments and boosts graduation rates. He also spotlighted studies showing children who attend preschool have lower teen pregnancy rates and are less prone to engage in violent crime. The Thursday stop required some scheduling changes at the school, which had yet to fully return from a winter holiday. Parents with children enrolled there received an e-mail this week with the offer of a \u201cone-day experience\u201d Thursday for the president\u2019s visit. \u201cThis day would resemble a normal school day: same bus routes and times, same school beginning and end times, regular instructional day with the same staff, and breakfast and lunch offerings,\u201d the school\u2019s principal, Suzanne Kennedy, wrote. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s visit promises to be an amazing opportunity for our students to expand their worlds and for Decatur to celebrate its exemplary teaching and learning.\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry for an explanation on the timing of the visit. Obama\u2019s emotional plea might lead to vote on guns Obama challenges GOP to work with him, but Rubio signals no",

            "article_content": "NEW: GOP legislators propose alternate spending cuts to sequestration Defense Secretary Panetta says political partisanship threatens U.S. stability \"This is not a game. This is reality,\" Panetta says of reduced readiness The across-the-board cuts will take effect March 1 unless Congress acts Furloughed workers, reduced combat readiness, shrunken naval operations and cuts to Air Force flying hours and weapons maintenance. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta listed those consequences as he provided a stark warning on Wednesday about the effects of impending budget cuts on the military unless Congress acts to avert them. The result, he said, would be \u201cthe most serious readiness crisis\u201d faced by the armed services in over a decade. Panetta\u2019s address at Georgetown University, which he called \u201chopefully one of my last speeches as secretary of defense,\u201d included the first details of how the Pentagon would deal with the automatic spending cuts \u2013 or sequestration in congressional jargon \u2013 set to trigger March 1 across federal agencies. For the Pentagon, sequestration would mean almost $500 billion in cuts over 10 years. For 2013 alone, some $46 billion in reduced spending would result in \u201ca serious disruption in defense programs and a sharp decline in our military readiness,\u201d Panetta said. Panetta to recommend pay cut for military Panetta to recommend pay cut for military Washington's budget battle Washington's budget battle Obama: Debt showdown would harm economy Obama: Debt showdown would harm economy Obama, Congress punts on spending cuts Obama, Congress punts on spending cuts Opinion: How to avoid job-killing budget cuts \u201cThere are no good options\u201d to deal with the situation, he continued, saying 46,000 department jobs would be at risk and more damaging measures in coming months could include: \u2013 Furloughing as many as 800,000 civilian workers for up to 22 days; \u2013 Cutting back on Army training and maintenance, which would reduce readiness of combat brigades outside Afghanistan; \u2013 Shrinking naval operations; and, \u2013 Reducing Air Force flying hours and weapons systems maintenance. \u201cThis is not a game. This is reality,\u201d Panetta said, his voice rising. \u201cThese steps would seriously damage a fragile American economy and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe.\u201d His comments sought to increase pressure on Republicans and Democrats to reach agreement on deficit-reduction steps, thereby avoiding the across-the-board spending cuts of sequestration that were part of a 2011 deal that raised the federal debt ceiling. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama called for a short-term deal to put off the cuts so Congress could continue work on a permanent fix that provides desired reductions in the federal deficit. Obama made clear that he still wants a broader deficit-reduction agreement with Republicans that includes spending cuts, some entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks. However, Obama said, with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown, Congress should pass a temporary fix that would allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan. By the numbers: Recent defense spending \u201cCompromise is a way to achieve it,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday, noting that Obama continued to offer proposals to cut spending and increase revenue that shifted to the middle from his original stances. However, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused Obama and Democrats of avoiding needed spending cuts and trying to put off tough decisions instead of facing their responsibilities as elected leaders. Deficit reduction should focus on cutting government spending and must include savings from popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Boehner insisted on Wednesday. \u201cAt some point, Washington has to deal with its spending problem,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve watched them kick this can down the road for 22 years. I\u2019ve had enough of it. It\u2019s time to act.\u201d Boehner also echoed Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky in opposing Obama\u2019s call for including more tax revenue in the mix. Opinion: Republicans, be smart about defense cuts Also Wednesday, GOP legislators proposed $85 billion in reduced spending through attrition \u2013 or not filling all vacated government jobs \u2013 and freezing congressional pay as an alternative to the sequestration this year. They said the plan achieves the same amount of deficit reduction without more tax revenue sought by Obama and Democrats. The debate continues the ideological showdown between Republicans and Democrats over the size and role of government. Republicans driven by their conservative base want to reduce government and taxes to fund it, arguing that is the best way to grow the economy. Democrats promote a strong government safety net through entitlements and support programs that they say bolsters middle-class opportunity necessary for economic growth. Congress and the White House agreed to the sequestration cuts as part of the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government\u2019s borrowing limit to meet its obligations. The automatic spending cuts never were intended to become law, but instead were designed to be so unwieldy and overbearing that Congress would reach a broader deficit reduction deal to avoid them. Military pay in play in game of political poker Deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012, an election year. Initially the cuts were to go into effect on January 2, but the government delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013. In his speech, Panetta referred to what he described as \u201cpartisan dysfunction in Congress\u201d that he said threatens the quality of life and national security of the nation. Instead of making tough decisions to resolve problems, political leaders from both parties let issues become crises that require immediate but insufficient responses, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the easy way out,\u201d Panetta said, adding that there is a price to be paid for such an approach. \u201cYou lose the trust of the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou create an aura of constant uncertainty that pervades every issue and gradually undermines the very credibility of the nation.\u201d CNN Explains: Sequestration In another effort to stoke public alarm over the pending cuts, Carney told reporters that top defense contractors met at the White House with senior administration officials to discuss the impacts on their industry. According to Carney, those impacts would be overwhelmingly negative. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a parlor game here in Washington,\u201d he said of the issue. \u201cThese are real-world decisions that significantly affect the economy and the American people.\u201d Obama said Tuesday that he still supports a broader deficit deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by Republicans \u2013 such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government \u2013 should be part of it. Boehner,  however, reiterated the GOP call for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and reforms \u2013 a reference to changes in entitlement programs. A last-second agreement in the previous Congress that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit-reduction package. That measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving Obama and Congress in which other steps to increase government revenue, such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations, were considered but not included in the final deal. How our tribes cause gridlock in Congress Obama and Democrats now want such revenue-raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts. McConnell expressed his opposition to such a move Tuesday, saying, \u201cThe American people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law.\u201d CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Nine Senate Republicans join Democrats in backing the budget plan Legislators call for restoring plan's cuts to future military pension benefits President Barack Obama is expected to sign the compromise The House overwhelmingly passed the spending plan last week For the first time in what seems like ages, Congress has passed a government spending plan without resorting to last-minute brinkmanship such as midnight negotiations to prevent an imminent government shutdown. The Senate voted 64-36 on Wednesday to send the compromise federal budget framework to President Barack Obama, who has signaled his support. Last week, the budget plan easily passed the House on a 332-94 vote, with solid majorities of both parties supporting it. Ayotte: Budget deal unfair to vets Ex-CBO directors: Budget right on basics Boehner, the tea party, and the GOP McCain: We can't shut down govt. again Budget deal could up airline travel cost We're going to hold people accountable While Wednesday\u2019s Senate vote was closer, nine Republicans joined the majority Democrats to provide the required majority of at least 51 votes to pass. The plan guides government spending into 2015, defusing the chances of a shutdown like the one in October that generated public anger against Congress, particularly conservative Republicans blamed for the impasse. Budget deal: Winners and losers Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the budget committee leaders in both chambers, negotiated the deal that eliminates some forced spending cuts known as sequestration that both sides disliked while reducing the deficit by more than $20 billion in coming years. Mixed opinions An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday showed that 50% of respondents supported the budget plan while 35% opposed it. According to the survey, a majority of Democrats and independents backed the proposal, while only 39% of Republicans liked it. Some Senate Republicans have said the most important issue at the moment was to lower the budget deficit, even if only by a small percentage, and avoid another damaging scenario like the 16-day government shutdown in October. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted \u201cto make sure we avoid any additional government shutdowns.\u201d \u201cThe federal government does enough harm to our economy,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to add additional harm by this crisis management.\u201d Poll: Congress neck-and-neck with car salespeople, lobbyists for least honest Conservative GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said in a statement that \u201csometimes the answer has to be yes.\u201d \u201cUltimately, his agreement upholds the principles conservatives stand for and, with Democrats controlling the White House and the Senate, it is the best we can hope for,\u201d he said of the plan. Other Republicans who voted \u201cyes\u201d on Wednesday were Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio. Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said his side dislikes some elements of the agreement, but that\u2019s life in divided government when the Senate and House are controlled by different parties. \u201cWe need to get some certainty, and that\u2019s what this does,\u201d he said Tuesday night on CNN, adding: \u201cNothing\u2019s going to be perfect in this world. It\u2019s called compromise.\u201d Budget compromise Final congressional approval was a rare example of budget bipartisanship after two years of seemingly endless confrontation and acrimony reflecting the differing ideologies of the two sides. Republicans, especially the conservative tea party wing that emerged in 2010, want to drastically shrink the government as the main tool for reducing federal deficits and debt. Democrats insist on protecting the social safety net for the most vulnerable Americans, such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. With midterm elections next year, the Washington dysfunction has spawned public disgust reflected by polls showing support for Congress around record low levels. Obama called the deal \u201ca good first step away from the shortsighted, crisis-driven decision-making that has only served to act as a drag on our economy.\u201d The plan The budget agreement, which was months in the making, eases spending caps while softening the impact of the sequestration cuts on defense and non-defense programs. It sets overall spending figures through fiscal year 2014, which started on October 1, as well as fiscal year 2015, with the intent of putting off any further congressional budget stalemate until after the November election. The strong vote in the sharply divided House last week brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters, who initially thought it would sail through the Senate, where bipartisanship has been more the norm.

Other senators from both parties called for going back later to replace the $6 billion in cuts to future cost-of-living increases in military pensions with reductions elsewhere. \u201cThese heroes lay their lives on the line for us and they deserve us to fix this provision,\u201d Isakson said before voting for the budget agreement.

            "article_content": "The House passed a compromise budget bill easily, sending it to the Senate Bill aims to avert another government shutdown as early as mid January It would also ease unpopular spending cuts to the military and other programs Majority Democrats need some Republican support to get measure through Senate It was smooth sailing in the House, but things are looking much tighter in the Senate for a bipartisan budget proposal that aims to avert another government shutdown and relax sweeping forced spending cuts. Still, despite strong opposition from Republicans to the compromise, supporters are within striking distance of rounding up the votes they need to pass it in the Senate next week. Top aides in both parties privately expressed confidence on Friday the bill will get the necessary support, even if a couple of wary moderate Democrats end up voting \u201cno.\u201d At least four Republicans told CNN they are committed to backing procedural votes needed to pass the measure. That gets the 55 Senate Democrats \u2014 most of whom are expected to support it \u2013 close to the 60 votes needed to get the legislation through the chamber. Final congressional approval of the elusive budget agreement would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off. It would also avert another government shutdown like the one in October that Americans largely blamed on Congress. \u201cI think it would be outrageous to shut down the government and I\u2019m not going to do that to my constituents who I represent,\u201d said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who has said he plans to vote for the bill. \u201cI hope it will pass the Senate,\u201d he said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Other key GOP members In addition to McCain, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a moderate who often votes with Democrats, said she will vote for the bill.  Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said they are undecided on the bill itself, but both will vote with Democrats on the critical procedural motions. Democrats think they have a chance of getting the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri.  Each seemed to be struggling with their decision. \u201cI would say it\u2019s not as good an agreement I had hoped for but it\u2019s a better agreement than I was afraid it might be.  So I\u2019m certainly open to looking at it,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cIt needs to get done for a lot of good reasons; we want to avoid a shutdown, clearly,\u201d Murkowski said.  \u201cDo I like a lot of the stuff in it?  Eh, no.\u201d Most GOP senators, raising a variety of concerns, are expected to vote against the bill. \u201cI\u2019m concerned we have once again kicked the can down now a long road,\u201d said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, who said he is undecided. \u201cI\u2019m leaning strongly against it,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a veteran lawmaker who opposes some of the fees the bill raises. Budget deal struck The budget agreement, which was months in the making, eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, on defense and nondefense programs. It does this, in part, by raising fees on airlines tickets, shrinking the retirement benefits of some veterans, extending some cuts to Medicare providers, and imposing other fees. Current federal spending expires in mid-January, raising the possibility of another shutdown at that time if there\u2019s not a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled. The strong vote in the House on the budget plan on Thursday \u2013 332-94 \u2013 brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters, who initially thought it would sail through the Senate, where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided House. But after reading details of the agreement, many Senate Republicans \u2013 including several in leadership positions \u2013 came out against the bill. \u201cI\u2019d really like to stay within the (spending) caps,\u201d complained Sen. John Boozman, R-Arkansas.  \u201cThis busts the caps and as a result I\u2019ll vote against it.\u201d \u201cI believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees,\u201d said Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, in announcing his opposition. \u201cWe need to find a better way to save $6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, who said he would vote against the bill. Graham, Wicker, and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, sent a letter to their Senate colleagues urging them to oppose the bill over the reduction in military benefits. It was unclear if the emergence of the politically sensitive issue would increase opposition. One Senator said outside interest groups for service members and veterans were caught off guard by the provision in the agreement and were just now beginning to mobilize against it. Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Nebraska, said he finds the military pension issue \u201cbothersome\u201d but remains undecided on how to vote. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say leaning yes or leaning no.  I\u2019m very concerned about the package but I can also see the merits of a two-year deal. So I want the weekend to think about it,\u201d he said. The retiring first-term lawmaker predicted the bill will pass the Senate regardless of how he votes. Midterm primaries, and 2016 The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has hinted strongly he will vote against it. He cites the weakening of the budget sequester as a key complaint. The same is true for his top two lieutenants \u2013 Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota \u2013 both of whom have declared they will oppose the compromise. McConnell and Cornyn are up for re-election and both face primary challenges from the right. That might explain some of their sensitivity to giving up on the budget cuts, which are very popular with conservative voters. Three leading tea party-backed senators with 2016 presidential aspirations \u2013 Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2013 also have come out against it for similar reasons. \u201cThe new budget deal moves in the wrong direction: it spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it,\u201d Cruz said.",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama says health care reforms worth some gray hairs NEW: Don't get discouraged by partisan fight over Obamacare, President says Young Americans are a key demographic for the success of Obamacare With website working better, the administration launches a pro-reform campaign Tell your friends. Don\u2019t get discouraged. It\u2019s worth the struggle. Sounding like a motivational speaker, President Barack Obama asked young supporters on Wednesday to encourage their peers to sign up for health coverage under his embattled reforms known both affectionately and derisively as Obamacare. At a White House Youth Summit, Obama used the opportunity to rally a key demographic for the success of the 2010 Affordable Care Act now that the system\u2019s problem-plagued website appeared to working smoothly for most users. Obamacare enrollment ramps up in days after website fix He compared the never-ending political fight over the health care reforms to struggles that surrounded social progress milestones of the past century. \u201cI hope you haven\u2019t been discouraged by how hard it\u2019s been because stuff that\u2019s worth it is always hard,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe civil rights movement was hard. Getting women the right to vote \u2013 that was hard. Making sure that workers had the right to organize \u2013 that was hard. It\u2019s never been easy for us to change how we do business in this country.\u201d Obama kicks off Obamacare PR offensive One-on-one with Larry Summers What did W.H. know before the launch? Reselling the Affordable Care Act Joking he had more gray hair because of relentless attacks on the reforms led by conservative Republicans, Obama added it was worth it and told the laughing summit participants to \u201cbe persistent\u201d in spreading information about new benefits and helping others enroll. \u201cYou may get a few gray hairs as a consequence, but at the end of the day, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s worth it,\u201d he said. The botched October 1 launch of the HealthCare.gov website for enrolling in new insurance exchanges set up under the reforms undermined the administration\u2019s efforts to create early momentum for the new system. White House begins three-week Obamacare blitz Meanwhile, critics led by conservative Republicans have tried to dismantle the health care law at every turn. With the website now functioning relatively smoothly, Obama launched a three-week blitz on Tuesday to promote the reforms as uninsured consumers now required to obtain health coverage face a December 23 deadline to sign up in order to be covered as of January 1. A properly functioning HealthCare.gov is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage. In theory, the law would create large pools of younger, healthier participants whose premiums would help offset the cost of providing care for older policy holders who use the health care system more. The program depends on convincing younger people who might be less inclined to pay for coverage they don\u2019t think they need. Obama told the youth summit participants to urge their friends and peers to \u201cimagine what happens if you get sick; what happens with the massive bills.\u201d Because of the reforms, he said, most young people without insurance are likely to get health coverage for less than they pay for their smartphones. Administration officials hope the new ability of HealthCare.gov to handle 800,000 users a day or more without major problems signals a major step forward in getting people to sign up. However, officials including Obama warn that glitches will persist and describe the website as a work in progress. \u201cThere will be other things that come up during the course of the next several months because you are starting off a new program that has an impact on one-sixth of the economy,\u201d Obama said Wednesday, adding that \u201cwe are just going to keep on working on it and improving it and refining it, and if we see a problem, we are going to fix it. But we are not repealing it.  Not as long as I am president.\u201d Insurance companies say some \u201cback-end\u201d aspects of the HealthCare.gov system continue to malfunction. In particular, insurers cite problems with applications from people who signed up through the website, including erroneous or missing information. Insurers still reporting errors on Obamacare applications White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that tech experts were working on the processing problems, offering assurances they would be fixed in time for coverage on January 1. 3 questions the administration won\u2019t answer about Obamacare Republican criticism continues Obama: No repeal of ACA while I'm here Bill Clinton on Obamacare Progress Clinton talks Obamacare and Hillary 2016 Republicans seeking to eliminate the health care reforms leap at any opening to attack the law that passed Congress without any GOP support. They accuse Obama and Democrats of lying about the effects of the reforms, noting several million people had policies canceled despite pledges they could keep coverage they liked, and they describe the Affordable Care Act as an example of big government run amok. On Wednesday, the Republican National Committee demanded that the administration make public the problems cited by insurers with the 834 forms for applying for coverage on HealthCare.gov. \u201cDemocrats are spending this week telling people how great they think Obamacare is, but they can\u2019t even get a website to function correctly,\u201d said a statement by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, adding that \u201cthe entire law \u2013 not just the website \u2013 is riddled with errors and needs to be repealed and replaced.\u201d Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee\u2019s national youth director, Elliott Echols, called Wednesday\u2019s White House event an attempt to distract young Americans from the problems of the reforms. \u201cI\u2019d love to see the White House use this time to answer some important questions from people, like \u2018Why are premiums doubling?\u2019 and \u2018Why can\u2019t I keep my doctor?\u2019 and \u2018Why did you lie to us?\u2019,\u201d Echols said in a statement. Obama and Democrats accuse Republicans of seeking to eliminate benefits of the reforms \u2013 such as guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and ending caps on coverage costs \u2013 without proposing anything substantive to help millions of uninsured Americans get affordable health insurance. He told the summit participants that they can play a significant role in helping people learn more about the reforms and signing up. \u201cThe truth is that for your friends, for your family, the most important source of information is not going to be me, it\u2019s going to be you,\u201d the President said. \u201cThey are going to trust you.\u201d Obama OK with \u2018Obamacare\u2019 label Getting specific, Obama urged student body leaders to organize conferences and bartenders to organize happy hours \u201cand also probably get health insurance because most bartenders don\u2019t have it.\u201d Can Obama recover? Jones: Yes, he can Obama: Website 'significantly improved' The President also cleared up any question about whether he had a problem with calling the reforms Obamacare, a label used pejoratively by Republican foes. Repeating a line from his successful re-election campaign last year, Obama said to laughter and applause Wednesday that \u201cI know people call this law Obamacare and that\u2019s OK because I do care, I do,\u201d adding, \u201cI care about you, I care about families, I care about Americans.\u201d Wording matters: Obamacare or Affordable Care Act? A source familiar with the website said Wednesday that 29,000 people had enrolled through it since officials announced Sunday that they had fixed the most egregious problems plaguing HealthCare.gov for the two previous months. The three-day figure is a vast improvement over October, the first month of the six-month enrollment period, when fewer than 27,000 people signed up through the HealthCare.gov website that was supposed to be the main enrollment portal. Overall, the total of enrollees in October topped 100,000, including those who used alternate channels and successful exchanges set up by 14 states. Marilyn Tavenner, the official charged with implementing Obamacare as director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said at a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of November. The overall enrollment target by the March 31 deadline for 2014 is 7 million.

            "article_content": "Saturday is the administration's deadline for HealthCare.gov to work for most users Officials say the website will work better but warn that some problems will persist Latest snafu: Small businesses can't enroll online for a year Tech expert: Success means high traffic moving fast and smoothly A moment of truth approaches for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms with Saturday\u2019s self-imposed deadline to get the website to work properly for most users. Obama and officials in charge of HealthCare.gov say the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people who go to the website to sign up at the end of the month will have a much improved experience than the crashes, error messages and delays users faced when it launched October 1. However, problems continue to plague the system, and technology experts question if the fixes being deployed by a team of government workers, outside contractors and specialists can get it functioning smoothly as soon as Saturday. Luke Chung, president of Virginia-based software developer FMS Inc., called the administration\u2019s prediction that HealthCare.gov would work at 80% capacity on or around November 30 an impractical threshold in the software world. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to build something that\u2019s only 80% complete,\u201d Chung told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t even understand how that works.\u201d The website woes raised questions about the viability and security of the system, and opened the reforms known as Obamacare to fresh attacks by conservative Republicans who seek to dismantle or eliminate them. More bad news emerged Wednesday when the administration announced the website will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year. White House: Enroll in Obamacare, but not too fast Insurers fear more Obamacare trouble Obamacare delayed for small businesses Obamacare small business exchange delay Tyson: Obamacare rollout didn't work Small businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as SHOP, but problems with HealthCare.gov have prevented their online enrollment so far. It was the third delay of the SHOP Marketplace component of the website, this time until November 2014. For now, \u201csmall businesses will be able to enroll directly in a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker and can get certified for a tax credit after they enroll,\u201d said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that oversees the rollout of the reforms. The Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t require companies with fewer than 50 employees to buy insurance for workers, though workers are required to have coverage. Employers who choose to provide coverage for their workers may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs. \u201cWe expect that making direct enrollment, tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50% of employee premiums in 2014,\u201d Bataille said. However, the head of the International Franchise Association complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll. \u201cWith this delay, it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied,\u201d said Steve Caldeira, the group\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cNot having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing, cumbersome and time-consuming for employers.\u201d Republicans pounced on the news, with House Speaker John Boehner urging Obama to delay implementation of the entire Affordable Care Act. \u201cThis law has been an absolute disaster, leaving us to ask, \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019 \u201d the Ohio Republican said in a statement. \u201cIf the President won\u2019t repeal it, he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on American families and small businesses as well as our economy.\u201d Boehner signs up for Obamacare Meanwhile, insurance industry insiders told CNN on condition of not being identified that problems continue with the transmission of data submitted by people signing up for coverage through HealthCare.gov. \u201cThere\u2019s no part of us that thinks all of this will be fixed in three days from now,\u201d an industry official said, referring to the November 30 date for the site to run smoothly for most users. Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the insurance trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said that \u201cthere is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that enrollments can be done and processed accurately.\u201d Insurers: Despite deadline, Obamacare glitches persist Do corporations have freedom of religion? Boehner signs up for Obamacare One side of Obamacare, failure One side of Obamacare, success Wednesday\u2019s developments came as the Obama administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment over the weekend. According to a White House official, the administration suggested this week that allied organizations hold off on launching campaigns to drive traffic to the website in the first week of December. Officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site can\u2019t handle, which is what occurred around its launch in October. HealthCare.gov was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users, and will reach that capacity by Saturday, the White House official said. However, big spikes in traffic \u2013 such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on October 1 \u2013 would cause users to go into a queue to receive e-mails advising them when to return, the official noted. Publicly, Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have been urging Americans to give HealthCare.gov another try, though they make clear it remains a work in progress. The November 30 target for website improvements \u201cdoes not represent a relaunch of HealthCare.gov; it is not a magical date,\u201d Bataille told reporters. \u201cThere will be times after November 30 when HealthCare.gov does not function properly.\u201d Website woes aside, a new CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday showed a majority of Americans believe the current Obamacare problems can be solved, and the figures for overall support and opposition remain little changed from a month ago. In a conference call Tuesday with state and local officials, Sebelius listed steps taken so far to improve the website\u2019s performance. \u201cWe\u2019ve added hardware, we\u2019ve added software; we\u2019re continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people,\u201d she said, urging the officials \u201cto not hesitate to recommend that people go to HealthCare.gov and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better.\u201d Sebelius: Obamacare website improvements \u2018on track\u2019 Can the Affordable Care Act be saved? Obamacare subsidies don't add up Where's the anonymous shopping perk? Obamacare fails to attract young people A properly functioning website is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the Affordable Care Act that require people to have health coverage. The failure of HealthCare.gov to enable people to enroll when the sign-up period began last month undermined the launch of new health insurance exchanges intended to provide affordable coverage for millions who previously were uninsured or under-insured. In theory, the exchanges create large pools of customers that include generally healthier and less-costly younger people as well as older folks who tend to require more expensive health care. Such large markets would hold down prices by allowing insurance companies to offset the higher costs of aging consumers with the money from lower-cost policy holders, the thinking goes. For the program to work, it needs to sign up younger people less inclined to pay for health coverage they don\u2019t believe they need. The GOP opposition targets the entire health care law, not just the website woes, as the ultimate example of big government run amok. Enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new insurance exchanges were much lower than initially expected. Now some states have reported stronger numbers. According to a CNN count based on available figures, a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare \u2013 either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, more than 370,000 have signed up for Medicaid under state programs expanded through the health care reforms, the CNN count shows. The enrollment period runs until March 31, and officials have said the target for the first year was 7 million people. To ensure they have coverage starting on January 1, consumers must sign up by December 23, the administration recently announced. Chung, the software expert, cited December 23 as the most significant deadline, noting that demand would be huge because people by nature wait until the last minute. Success for the website would be determined by both the number of users as well as how long they are in the system, Chung said, comparing it to a highway on which 50,000 people traveling 60 mph is smooth traffic while the same number going 10 mph is a jam. Also Wednesday, seven Democratic senators, including some up for re-election next year, asked Obama to appoint a special health care overseer to ensure continuity in efforts to fix the problems. Sebelius is technically the top administration official in the implementation of Obamacare, but former White House aide Jeff Zients was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the site. Zients will become a top economic adviser to Obama in January. In a letter, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mark Warner of Virginia, Christopher Coons of Delaware, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Udall of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia called for Obama to name a  successor to Zients. Separately,  an HHS official confirmed the government will go with a new Web-hosting contractor, Hewlett-Packard, for HealthCare.gov early next year. The current contract with Terremark ends in March. The official said the decision to go with a different vendor was made months before any problems with HealthCare.gov were identified and was unrelated to an outage that struck the site in late October, which the administration blamed on the Verizon subsidiary. The HP contract was signed in July.

That creaking sound from Washington is the nerves of congressional Democrats in response to the political firestorm raging around Obamacare. The botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s vital new marketplaces, coupled with insurers notifying more than a million Americans that their policies were being canceled, raised questions about the administration competence and honesty in selling and implementing President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms. After Obama\u2019s apology, talk of solutions and \u2013 still \u2013 the website Republicans still licking their wounds after last month\u2019s failed bid to dismantle Obamacare by shutting down the government got a new chance to attack, keeping the issue in national headlines because of the problems rather than a successful launch of the enrollment process. Issa accused of selectively leaking Obamacare documents GOP moves past troubled website Obama apologized on Thursday night in an interview with NBC and said unspecified steps would be taken to help those losing coverage. However, some Democrats facing re-election battles next year are joining Republicans in calling for the administration to delay provisions of the 2010 law that survived a Supreme Court challenge last year. Vulnerable Senate Dems voice concerns to Obama, Biden Here are four reasons why Democrats are nervous: Obama 'sorry' people lost health plans President Obama: 'I am sorry' When presidents say 'I'm sorry' Does Sec. Sebelius still have a job? Website woes The major problem has been the failure of the HealthCare.gov website that was set up to enroll people in new Obamacare health insurance exchanges starting on October 1. Instead of a comprehensive online portal for uninsured people or those who buy individual coverage to readily shop for policies online, the website became a symbol of government failure when most early visitors couldn\u2019t log in, got constant error messages, faced long delays and had their profiles disappear. CMS staffer points to improvements in flawed site A public relations nightmare ensued, with the administration the butt of national jokes. A spoof song at Wednesday\u2019s CMA Awards show lampooned the wait faced by people trying to use the website, with co-hosts Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood singing: \u201cI\u2019m going to wind up with hemorrhoids, if I sit here \u2018til dawn.\u201d But the actual damage has been much more significant. The health care reforms depend on full public participation to create large markets that reflect the broad public spectrum \u2013 including both less-expensive younger people and more expensive older folks \u2013 as well as more competition for the increased business. What else could go wrong with Obamacare? HealthCare.gov was supposed to be both the main source of public information and the main vehicle for signing people up. Its early failures made the tough challenge of launching the markets appear insurmountable. At a series of committee hearings in recent weeks, Democratic legislators joined Republicans in lambasting the Obama administration for the malfunctioning website. They called the problems and the government\u2019s failure to anticipate them unacceptable, and demanded fast action to get HealthCare.gov functioning smoothly. \u201cThis is the 21st Century,\u201d Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California told a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on October 24. She rejected an administration contention that initial website volume was higher than expected, noting that Amazon and Ebay don\u2019t crash days before Christmas and ProFlowers doesn\u2019t crash just before Valentine\u2019s Day. The administration says it will have the Obamacare website running smoothly for the \u201cvast majority of users\u201d by November 30, though it warns the first enrollment figures coming out next week will be far lower than expected. \u201cThey were always going to be low,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday. \u201cAnd that was even when we did not expect the problems with the website that occurred.\u201d At the same time, Carney noted the enrollment period runs through March, adding that a fully functioning website by the end of November would leave plenty of time for people to enroll for required coverage under the law. CNNMoney: Obamacare deadlines clarified Both supporters and detractors acknowledge that continued website problems beyond November 30 would be a major problem threatening the goal of robust enrollment by the end of March. Democrats on edge over Obamacare Obama: Website woes fixed by Nov. 30 Sebelius grilled on Affordable Care Act Obama tweaks health care pledge The law itself The bigger fear for Democrats is that public sentiment will side with Republicans who have warned for four years that Obamacare amounted to big government run amok, resulting in an unmanageable new bureaucracy. Regardless of how things turn out, the perception so far is that the administration\u2019s inability to effectively launch a crucial part of the Affordable Care Act might foreshadow further problems down the road. GOP on insurance cancellations: \u2018We told you so\u2019 Obama sought to blunt that argument in the NBC interview, saying the goal of the health care reforms \u2013 making affordable coverage available to millions of uninsured and underinsured people \u2013 remained crucial and that the reforms he championed were the best way to pursue it. \u201cI think we, in good faith, have been trying to take on a health care system that has been broken for a very long time,\u201d the President said. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve been trying to do is to change it in the least disruptive way possible.\u201d However, the biggest disruption to date \u2013 cancellation notices to a small percentage of Americans after Obama repeatedly promised they could keep coverage they liked \u2013 provided strong ammunition for strong GOP attacks that put the President and Democrats on defense. \u201cDespite Democrats\u2019 promises, millions of families are losing their insurance, losing access to their doctors, or being forced to pay more for insurance,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Friday in trying to link the issue to a stronger-than-expected October jobs report. \u201cTheir household economies are taking a hit, and Obamacare has made life more uncertain for them.\u201d Obama\u2019s apology addressed the cancellation notices received by some among the 5% of Americans who buy their own individual health insurance instead of getting coverage through their jobs or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid like 80% of the population. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a small percentage of folks who may be disadvantaged, you know, it means a lot to them.  And it\u2019s scary to them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I am sorry that they\u2013 you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me.\u201d On Friday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the administration was \u201clooking at a number of options\u201d on how to help people with canceled policies, \u201cbut there isn\u2019t any specific proposal at the table immediately.\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday that Obama \u201chas directed his team to consider some administrative solutions to those problems,\u201d but he also emphasized the need to better educate Americans with canceled policies on the options they have for getting more comprehensive coverage. Carney said Thursday that Democratic concerns focused on the website problems rather than the guts of the reforms. \u201cEvery one of the Democrats who voted for this and believed in it and fought for it, and with the president, defended it against the constant assault by Republicans and outside opponents, continue to believe in it, and believe it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said. CMA hosts riff on Obamacare Key players in the health care hearings Election year politics By this time next year, voters will have decided races for all 435 House seats and 33 of the 100 Senate seats, including 21 now held by Democrats. With five Senate Democratic incumbents retiring, the 16 up for re-election are especially vulnerable to attack from the political right over Obamacare. Already, the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity has spent more than $7.6 million in recent weeks on TV, radio and web ads attacking legislators who support Obamacare and applauding those against the reforms. Conservative group continues to pile money into anti-Obamacare ads AFP is partially funded by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, who have spent many millions of dollars to back conservative causes and candidates. One set of ads targeted Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who is facing a tough re-election battle in the conservative-leaning state. Landrieu backed the Affordable Care Act, but now calls for Obama to make good on his pledge that people who like their policies can keep them. She announced last week that she will introduce legislation allowing people to maintain their current coverage into 2014 as long as they make the payments, saying: \u201cA promise was made that if you like your health plan, you can keep it - and I will do everything I can to see that the promise is kept.\u201d At the same time, she echoed the administration\u2019s argument that most of the individual policy holders getting cancellation notices will get a better deal under Obamacare. \u201cMany people may find better plans in the marketplaces that offer superior coverage for them at a good value and at a potentially lower cost,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cBut if people want to keep their current plans, they should be able to do so.\u201d Landrieu flew with Obama to New Orleans on Friday, but she missed his speech on economic development due to what her office called long-scheduled events in Lake Charles. Obama praised her during his remarks for tireless advocacy on behalf of the people of Louisiana. She was one of 15 Democratic Senators, most of them facing re-election challenges in 2014, who met with Obama at the White House this week to discuss the Obamacare brouhaha. \u201cThere would not have been this meeting if you didn\u2019t have this group of Senators up in 2014,\u201d a Democratic staffer with knowledge of the event told CNN. Some who took part said they pushed Obama to make changes such as extending the deadline to enroll past March 31 or delay the fine for failing to do so. Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas said he told the President to \u201chold the individuals in charge accountable for these mistakes\u201d involving the website and other issues, while Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska cited \u201can understandable crisis in confidence because the administration has yet to get\u201d HealthCare.gov \u201coff the ground.\u201d A separate meeting between White House staff and aides to House Democratic leaders was taking place Friday, according to a senior House Democratic aide. Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is teaming with Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois on a measure to effectively put off the requirement for everyone to obtain insurance for a year by delaying the fine for non-compliance. \u201cThis commonsense proposal simply allows Americans to take more time to browse and explore their options, making 2014 a true transition year,\u201d Manchin said in a joint statement with Kirk. At this point, the proposals amount to political posturing. The administration opposes any delay, even as it considers specific steps to help people facing canceled policies, and it was unlikely that any legislation that included major changes to Obamacare would pass the Senate or get signed by the President. \u201cDelaying the Affordable Care Act wouldn\u2019t delay people\u2019s cancer or diabetes or Parkinson\u2019s,\u201d Sebelius told a Senate committee this week, adding that \u201cfor for millions of Americans, delay is not an option. People\u2019s lives depend on this.\u201d GOP scorched earth tactics The upcoming elections aside, Democrats also are contending with the no-holds-barred opposition by Republicans who seek any opportunity to call for getting rid of the health care reforms despised by Republicans. Going back to the debate on Obamacare that started in 2009, GOP legislators have fought it in committees and in both the House and Senate, with zero Republicans supporting the Affordable Care Act when it passed in 2010. Republican attorneys general helped mount the unsuccessful Supreme Court challenge against the reforms, and some GOP governors now have rejected federal money under Obamacare to expand Medicaid coverage for indigent people lacking health insurance. Obama criticized such resistance at speeches this week in two GOP-led states that have rejected the Medicaid expansion \u2013 Texas and Louisiana. Joining the federal program would mean fewer uninsured people going to emergency rooms for their health care, which Obama said resulted in a \u201chidden tax\u201d because hospitals pass the resulting extra costs on to everyone else. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do for the health of our economies as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a practical, pragmatic reason to do it that has nothing to do with politics or ideology.\u201d In Washington, meanwhile, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee issued a subpoena for the administration to turn over enrollment figures so far by Friday. Sebelius has said the first figures would be released next week, and there was no sign her department would budge. The GOP push for figures seeks to cast the botched rollout of the Obamacare website in the worst possible light. Sebelius and Carney have tried to downplay expectations by repeatedly saying the initial figures would be lower than expected. Both Obama and Sebelius repeatedly emphasize that the website problems have prevented consumers from getting the information they need about coverage options, possible government subsidies and other details that they insist would alleviate concerns. At the Senate hearing Wednesday, Sebelius implied without directly saying so that Republicans were failing to properly inform their constituents about the health care reforms. \u201cI think that it is always welcome to have elected officials in their home states give information to constituents about what the law says, what their options are, what their benefits could be, what choices they have, and how to access the process,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "NEW: \"We are working overtime to get this fixed,\" says the President in Texas Tech official at agency overseeing Obamacare website is leaving the government Legislators grill HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for the second time in a week Republicans accuse President Obama of lying about the impact of health reforms It\u2019s not just about the website anymore. Republican foes of Obamacare still use words like \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cepic\u201d failure in describing the problems with HealthCare.gov, the portal for enrolling in President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms. However, they also concede the technology problems will likely get resolved, as promised again Wednesday by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. The broader GOP focus is on their dislike for the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 with no Republican support and upheld last year by the Supreme Court. At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Republicans accused Obama of lying to the American people in selling the reforms and railed against the impacts, including individual policyholders getting cancellation notices and premium prices rising in some areas. Democrats on edge over Obamacare Sebelius grilled on Affordable Care Act Obama tweaks health care pledge People can keep their insurance? Obama\u2019s oft-repeated pledge that people could keep coverage they liked was \u201csimply untrue,\u201d said GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, while his conservative colleague Sen. John Cornyn of Texas called it a \u201cfalse statement made to the American people.\u201d Obama, Biden meet with Senate Democrats WH: Obama \u2018can\u2019t go back\u2019 and change Obamacare vow When Cornyn and fellow Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota pushed Sebelius on whether Obama\u2019s statement was true or false, she repeated the administration\u2019s response that a grandfather clause included in the legislation allows people to keep policies that were in place before the law was signed more than three years ago. The matter involves a relatively small segment of the insurance market \u2013 the 5% of Americans who buy individual policies, unlike the vast majority who get their coverage through their jobs or government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and others. While only a sliver of the overall market, it still involves 12 million people, including more than 1 million who have received letters from their insurers telling them current policies are being discontinued. Sebelius said Wednesday that the goal of the health care reforms known as Obamacare was to ensure everyone has minimum standards of coverage, which didn\u2019t exist in the individual market before the reforms. She said Obama\u2019s pledge that people can keep policies they liked \u2013 which Cornyn and Thune noted remained on the White House website on Wednesday \u2013 was mostly in reference to the 80% of Americans getting coverage from employer and federal programs, as well as some in the individual markets. Obama further alters \u2018you can keep your plan\u2019 pledge That was insufficient for Cornyn, who questioned why no one had lost their job so far over the botched website launch on October 1 or false statements by administration officials on people losing health coverage. \u201cThe only thing I can conclude is that it is impossible to do something in this administration that gets you fired. It is impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can lie to the American people. You can consistently misrepresent the facts, but it is impossible to get fired.\u201d White House: Obama can't go back in time Obamacare sticker shock? Key players in the health care hearings Debunking 4 Obamacare myths: Both sides get it wrong Obama went to Texas on Wednesday to meet with \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2013 people hired to help Americans obtain health insurance through the newly established federal and state marketplaces. He spoke about his frustrations with the website. In Dallas, Obama reassures that website fix is coming \u201cThis is like having a really good product in a store, and the cash registers don\u2019t work, and there aren\u2019t enough parking spots, and nobody can get through the door,\u201d the President said. \u201cWe are working overtime to get this fixed and the website is already better than it was at the beginning of October. And by the end of this month, we anticipate that it is going to be working the way it is supposed to,\u201d Obama said. Back in Washington, Cornyn asked Sebelius if the thousands of navigators had been properly screened. Sebelius said a background check was not required for navigators on the federal exchange, noting such screening also wasn\u2019t federally required for insurance agents. \u201cSo a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual unbeknownst to them?\u201d Cornyn asked. \u201cThat is possible,\u201d Sebelius responded. \u201cWe have contracts for the organizations and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job \u2026 but it is possible.\u201d Sebelius also came under fire from a fellow Kansan, GOP Sen. Pat Roberts, who said she should resign because of the website woes and other Obamacare problems. \u201cMore people are losing their insurance than signing up on the website,\u201d Roberts said, adding that the resulting limbo \u201cmeans the difference between life and death for many Americans who are at a loss for what to do.\u201d Sebelius called the website problems unacceptable and said they were being fixed, declaring herself accountable for the troubled launch. At the same time, she said an \u201ceven higher level of accountability\u201d existed involving the tens of millions of Americans previously ineligible or unable to afford health insurance who now can get coverage because of Obamacare. Obamacare: It\u2019s about government, future elections \u201cThe impact on the lives of everyday people is getting lost,\u201d Sebelius said of the torrid political debate spurred by the website problems and persistent Republican efforts to undermine the law passed with no GOP votes in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Asked how many people had enrolled so far, Sebelius repeated that figures for the first month would be made public next week and that they would be less than originally anticipated because of the website problems that hindered the ability of large numbers to sign up. \u201cOur early enrollment numbers are going to be very low,\u201d she said. She rejected calls by Republicans and some Democrats up for re-election next year to delay implementation of Obamacare\u2019s vital individual mandate that requires people to have health coverage or get fined. \u201cDelaying the Affordable Care Act wouldn\u2019t delay people\u2019s cancer or diabetes or Parkinson\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 Delaying the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t delay the foreclosure notices for families forced into bankruptcy by unpayable medical bills. It doesn\u2019t delay the higher costs all of us pay when uninsured Americans are left with no choice but to rely on emergency rooms for care. So for millions of Americans, delay is not an option. People\u2019s lives depend on this.\u201d The White House announced that Obama met Wednesday with Senate Democrats to discuss concerns about Obamacare, particularly that the website problems will prevent people from signing up in time for new coverage. One participant, Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, said he urged Obama \u201cto extend the enrollment period to give consumers enough time to make an informed decision about their family\u2019s health insurance options.\u201d Udall also said he pushed for assurances that information submitted to the HealthCare.gov website would be protected, a concern stressed by fellow Democrats and Republicans at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. It was the second hearing in a week in which Sebelius got grilled by legislators over the website problems and the overall reforms. Earlier: 5 things we learned from Sebelius Democrats agreed that the website must get fixed as quickly as possible, repeating the \u201cunacceptable\u201d label used by Sebelius and Republicans for the inability to log in, lengthy delays, error messages and other problems that occurred with the launch of HealthCare.gov. However, they also backed the health care reforms and called for Republicans to work together to fix problems instead of seeking to wipe out the law. \u201cThose who seek to ascribe blame are the same folks who have spent every waking hour of the last four years working to dismantle, destroy, obstruct and impede the success of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey. Noting that similar attacks faced the advent and launch of other social welfare advances in the past such as Social Security and Medicare, Menendez noted those programs now were popular as part of a government safety net for elderly citizens. Republican opponents of Obamacare, he said, were \u201cconcerned not about its failure, they\u2019re concerned about its success.\u201d Website goes dark nightly for fix-it work Meanwhile, the official in charge of technology at the federal agency that developed the HealthCare.gov website is leaving the government for a private-sector job, according to an internal e-mail. Chief Information Officer Tony Trenkle\u2019s departure from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services is effective November 15, according to the email by Chief Operating Officer Michelle Snyder. Asked if Trenkle was being pushed out due to his role in the Obamacare website\u2019s development, CMS communications director Julie Bataille declined to elaborate. \u201cTony made a decision that he was going to move to the private sector and that is what our COO announced yesterday,\u201d Bataille told reporters on Wednesday.

            "article_content": "After more than three years of Obamacare, myths about the reforms persist For some, you can't keep your plan even if you like it Not everyone will pay more because of Obamacare A broken website doesn't mean all is lost -- yet For four years, we\u2019ve witnessed a non-stop political brawl over Obamacare. Now rhetoric has again reached a fever pitch since the botched October 1 launch of the new insurance exchanges at the heart of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms. While Obama and Democrats scramble to reassure supporters and a skeptical nation that the dysfunctional Obamacare website can be fixed and the reforms will work, Republican opponents seize every opportunity to attack the 2010 Affordable Care Act they consider to be big government run amok. Not surprisingly, such partisan back-and-forth has generated persistent myths about Obamacare that foment confusion, if not outright ignorance, about the reforms. In other cases, both sides try to quickly exploit newer issues. Here is an attempt to debunk some of them: Like your health plan ... keep it? Obamacare sticker shock? What else could go wrong with Obamacare? Ayotte: 'Call a timeout' on Obamacare 1. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan Let\u2019s start with the obvious \u2013 Obama\u2019s oft-repeated pledge in selling the reforms that they wouldn\u2019t require people to change health coverage or doctors. While the administration depends on a technicality to explain what Obama meant \u2013 he was referring only to individually owned policies already in place back in March 2010 when the Affordable Care Act became law \u2013 it was misleading when he started saying it back in 2008 and definitely is false today. Yes, anyone with an individual policy dating back more than three years can keep it, as long as it hasn\u2019t been changed by the insurance company. However, that is unlikely in the volatile individual market that comprises about 5% of Americans, a relatively small group compared to the 80% who get coverage through their jobs or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Instead, at least 1 million individual policy holders have received letters from their insurers in recent months informing them that their plans are being discontinued at the end of the year or changed to cost more. The reason cited is added benefits required by Obamacare. \u201cThe fact that the president sold it on a basis that was not true has undermined the foundation of his second term,\u201d former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who lost to Obama in last year\u2019s presidential election, told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Obama and his aides argue the President kept his word by including a \u201cgrandfather\u201d provision that allowed people to keep their plans from before the health care law was passed, as long as the policies hadn\u2019t been changed by the insurance companies. At the same time, they contend most policies no longer eligible for the \u201cgrandfather\u201d provision \u2013 and therefore being canceled by insurers  \u2013 offered substandard coverage, leaving people at risk of bankruptcy for hospitalization or other major medical needs. \u201cIf you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really like that plan, what we said was you could keep it if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law was passed,\u201d Obama told supporters on Monday night. \u201cBut if the insurance company changes it, then what we\u2019re saying is they\u2019ve got to change it to a higher standard,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cif we had allowed these old plans to be downgraded or sold to new enrollees once the law had already passed, then we would have broken an even more important promise \u2013 making sure that Americans gain access to health care that doesn\u2019t leave them one illness away from financial ruin.\u201d His explanation differed from the repeated promises on the campaign trail that if people liked their coverage, they could keep it, period. Obama aides note that for most Americans who get their health care through their jobs or government programs, that remains true. \u201cWhat the President was referring to was the broader promise of the Affordable Care Act, that if you\u2019re on Medicare or Medicaid, if you, like probably most people in this room, have insurance through your employer, if you\u2019re a vet and you get coverage through the (Veterans administration), you don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday. Obama further alters \u2018you can keep your plan\u2019 pledge 2. Everyone\u2019s health insurance costs will rise because of Obamacare Republicans regularly declare that the end result of Obamacare will be higher health insurance costs for all. If that happened, it would continue what was going on before Obamacare, when skyrocketing health care costs put effective insurance coverage out of reach for millions of Americans. Obamacare requires virtually everyone to have health insurance, which would create large markets of previously uninsured or underinsured people to stimulate competition and presumably hold down prices. That means some will pay more than before, such as healthier young people now required by the Affordable Care Act to have coverage, and some will pay less. Under the reforms, some people who make too much to be eligible for Medicaid coverage but not enough to afford high-quality plans can get government subsidies in the form of tax credits to ease the burden. Ezekiel Emanuel, an Obamacare architect from the University of Pennsylvania, told Fox News Sunday that the reforms were based on the concept of shared responsibility. \u201cWe all share in the costs so that everyone can get it,\u201d he said, adding that if people don\u2019t have coverage and need health care, \u201cthey transfer those costs to the rest of us. That\u2019s the whole point of part of Obamacare, to eliminate this cost shifting.\u201d Obamacare website getting better, official tells Senate panel 3. Write me In recent weeks, as the extent of problems with the Obamacare website became known, the President and his aides sought to reassure the public by noting other options to enroll, including paper applications they could file by mail to avoid the dysfunctional online option. However, notes from so-called War Room meetings of administration officials released by the Republican-led House Oversight Committee showed all applications still must be processed through the HealthCare.gov website, regardless of whether they were submitted online or mailed in. \u201cThe same portal is used to determine eligibility no matter how the application is submitted,\u201d said notes from an October 11 meeting, according to the committee. \u201d \u2026 The paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provide another option; at the end of the day, we are all stuck in the same queue.\u201d Website performance has improved, but problems continue as open enrollment for Obamacare enters the second of a planned six months. A notice at the top of HealthCare.gov on Monday explained it will be out of order between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET every day as contractors work on it. Obamacare website goes dark for nightly fix-it work 4. The website is broken, so Obamacare is a failure \u201cThe website is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Monday. \u201cThere is the sticker shock for increased costs.  There\u2019s increased out-of-pocket cost in terms of deductibles and co-pays, and many Americans are not going to be able to keep their doctor, even if they\u2019d like to keep their doctor.\u201d No one disputes that the website woes are a major problem that threatens to derail the vital enrollment of millions of uninsured or underinsured people if not fixed soon. However, the law was passed more than three years ago, and Obama aides point out it has already made a difference. In his speech Monday night, Obama listed various reforms that already have taken effect. \u201cThe insurance market now has the strongest consumer protections that this country has ever known,\u201d he said of the reforms. \u201cNo more discriminating against kids with pre-existing conditions. No more dropping your policy when you get sick. No more lifetime limits on the care that you can receive.  All of that and more is part of a new Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights that\u2019s smack dab in the middle of the Affordable Care Act, and it\u2019s helping people right now.\u201d Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who helped design both Obamacare and the Massachusetts health insurance program on which it was modeled, counseled patience in assessing whether reforms should be labeled a success or failure. \u201cAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, it will be about a three-year ramp-up period until Obamacare is fully effective at its full level of functioning,\u201d Gruber told CNN last week. \u201cThat\u2019s what we saw in Massachusetts as well. So we need to just calm down and stop worrying about days and weeks and focus instead on months and years.\u201d However, Gruber warned that the HealthCare.gov website must be fully operational by the end of November to ensure that people being forced to change policies have time to enroll by January 1, when their current coverage ends. The Obama administration says the website will work smoothly for the \u201cvast majority\u201d of users by November 30.

            "article_content": "Many presidents have uttered phrases they later regretted Obama takes heat for saying that 'If you like your health insurance, you can keep it' George W. Bush came under fire for comments during Hurricane Katrina and the run-up to the Iraq War \u201cRead my lips.\u201d \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d \u201cDefinition of \u2018Is\u2019\u201d Every modern president has got one \u2013 an inelegant statement, a broken promise, or an outright steaming lie, distilled to a three-second sound bite, that follows them into history. It can be part of a campaign slogan, a policy address or legal testimony. It can be delivered at a party convention, as part of a stump speech, from an aircraft carrier or during a deposition. It can be well-intentioned, misinformed, only untrue after the fact. And the facts can be entirely debatable. But there seems to be a lie or two that follows presidents into the history books. Here is a look at some recent  memorable ones: 1. \u2018If you like your health insurance, you can keep it\u2019 He\u2019s got some time in office left, but Barack Obama\u2019s signature gaffe line probably is going to be: \u201cIf you like your health insurance, you can keep it\u201d It was a key line in selling the Affordable Care Act, which narrowly passed back in 2010. But he has said it since then, too. What he said was true for most Americans. They get their health insurance through their employer or the government with Medicare. But as open enrollment began this month for the fewer than 20% of Americans Obamacare was designed to help, it became clear there is a subset of people who like their health plans and will in fact lose their health plans. These are the subset of Americans who buy their insurance individually and, because those plans don\u2019t cover everything Obamacare now says must be covered, will have to get a new health care plan. RELATED: The hidden truth behind early Obamacare numbers: It\u2019s not what it seems Granted, it might be a better health care plan. It might cover more services, like hospital stays, maternity, and mental health. But it also might be more expensive. Obama tweaked the promise after the fact during an appearance in Massachusetts on Wednesday. But it\u2019s not exactly going to fit on a bumper sticker any more: \u201cNow, if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law and you really liked that plan, you\u2019re able to keep it,\u201d Obama said this week. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said when I was running for office. That was part of the promise we made. But ever since the law was passed, if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel these substandard plans, what we said under the law is you\u2019ve got to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage  \u2013 because that, too, was a central premise of the Affordable Care Act from the very beginning.\u201d \u201cAnd today, that promise means that every plan in the marketplace covers a core set of minimum benefits, like maternity care, and preventive care, and mental health care, and prescription drug benefits, and hospitalization,\u201d Obama explained. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t use allergies or pregnancy or a sports injury or the fact that you\u2019re a woman to charge you more. They can\u2019t do that anymore. They can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d 2. \u2018Read my lips. No new taxes\u2019 George H.W. Bush\u2019s was the most devastating. \u201cRead my lips,\u201d he declared at the 1988 Republican National Convention. \u201cNo new taxes!\u201d It was a campaign pledge. And he broke it, big time. Bush didn\u2019t want to break the pledge, but in the face of a recession, and to avoid $100 billion in automatic, across-the-board spending cuts, he acquiesced and allowed a tax hike on the wealthy. It was disastrous for Bush. It created a rift in the GOP and directly led to a spirited primary challenge two years later by Pat Buchanan. Bush ended up winning the primary, but losing re-election in a three-way race against Bill Clinton and Ross Perot. 3. Mission Accomplished George W. Bush never said, \u201cMission Accomplished,\u201d but the banner placed behind him did when he landed on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln in a Navy jet and declared that \u201cmajor combat operations in Iraq have ended.\u201d They hadn\u2019t. In fact they were just getting started. And Bush would have to stake his legacy on a subsequent surge of American troops in Iraq. Bush won re-election in 2004, but the war cost America a great deal in blood and treasure. Fatigue with Iraq contributed greatly to Republicans\u2019 losing control of Capitol Hill in 2006. 4. \u2018\u2026Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium\u2026\u2019 Some presidents have more than one. The younger Bush will also be remembered for his decision to use public unity following the 9/11 attacks to mount a war in Iraq, and the 16 words he used to justify the action. The case Bush made in his 2003 State of the Union address helped lead the United States into Iraq. He said, \u201cThe British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\u201d It wasn\u2019t true. But that didn\u2019t become clear until later after a high-profile scandal involving the leaking of CIA agent Valerie Plame\u2019s identity by Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff. But the point of the 16 words, more importantly, is that the intelligence used to convince the country that combat operations were necessary to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction was inherently flawed. 5. \u2018Brownie, you\u2019re doing a heck of a job.\u2019 And not to pile on Bush \u201943\u2019, but in the days just after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast and left much of New Orleans under water, the president came under intense heat for what was seen as a lackluster response by the federal government. On September 2, 2005, just three days after Katrina destroyed the levees and flooded much of New Orleans\u2019 Ninth Ward, Bush heaped unusual praise on then-FEMA director Michael Brown during a briefing at the Mobile Regional Airport. The soundbite, \u201cBrownie, you\u2019re doing a heck of a job,\u201d would haunt the president and go on to define a perception that Bush was out of touch during one of the worst tragedies in American history. Brown later resigned. 6. \u2018I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky\u2026\u2019 Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr wasn\u2019t originally appointed to investigate Bill Clinton\u2019s Oval Office sex life. But somehow that\u2019s what it turned into. And without getting too far into the sordid details, the President found himself giving a videotaped deposition in a case regarding sexual harassment charges. The whole definition of sexual relations and the word \u201cis\u201d became a thing, the President faced impeachment and was nearly thrown out of office. He survived, but his legacy and his agenda were tarnished. And the list goes on. Ronald Reagan had to admit he didn\u2019t know about the Iran-Contra affair.  Jimmy Carter talked to the nation about a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d and was panned for giving a \u201cmalaise\u201d speech. And Gerald Ford\u2019s contention in a debate with Carter that \u201cThere is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe\u201d made him look oblivious to the Soviet Union\u2019s political and military control of the region. There are some rules that emerge. If the moment has to do with the economy and it occurs in the first term, there\u2019s a good chance the president won\u2019t make it to a second term. If it has to do with foreign affairs, it might be just a blip on their legacy. The good news for Obama is that he\u2019s been through his last election. The bad news is this demonstrably false new line has everything to do with his signature health law. As it carries on, how Americans react to the implementation of Obamacare could have real consequences on whether his successor is a president who wants to make the law better or gut it.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Insurance insider: Those working on website didn't want to tell White House about issues Republicans call for Sebelius to resign or get fired over the Obamacare website problems The White House mounts a campaign to boost enrollment in 10 cities Health insurance CEOs meet with administration officials, including Sebelius Call it the Obamacare website fiasco, with the focus Wednesday on Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius after she told CNN that President Barack Obama knew nothing of the problem before it became evident starting on October 1. Sebelius headed to the White House for an afternoon meeting with insurance industry executives, then was scheduled to leave town to participate with other officials in what the administration calls a \u201cgrass-roots effort\u201d to boost enrollment in Obama\u2019s signature health care reform system. Republican opponents seeking to undermine the 2010 Affordable Care Act call for Sebelius to be fired for the website problems in the program overseen by her department. They also want to delay the deadline for people to obtain health coverage under the law or face a fine, with some congressional Democrats joining that call. Here are the latest developments: Insurance CEOs meet with officials The CEOs of several major insurance companies \u2013 including the heads of Aetna, WellPoint and Humana \u2013 met Wednesday with top U.S. officials about problems with the Obamacare website\u2019s rollout. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius led \u201ca very productive discussion\u201d that ended with an agreement that technical groups from insurers will work directly with government experts to address the issues, said a source in the room. Insurers pledge to help solve problems \u201cThe reality is that we have so much expertise they haven\u2019t tapped into enough,\u201d said the source. \u201cThese are people who have built these systems.\u201d A well-placed industry insider told CNN that top health insurers were well aware of problems with the website\u2019s application process ahead of its October 1 launch, yet people involved in its creation downplayed the flaws. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the folks working on this, in the (Obama) administration, gave a far rosier picture to people in the White House,\u201d the insider said. \u201cNo one wanted to go to the White House and say to the President that your significant legislative achievement may not go well.\u201d Insurance industry aware of website issues The troubles include the difficulties that many people are having setting up accounts, as well as the fact that enrollment files being received by insurers are sometimes incomplete, have erroneous information or arrive in duplicate. At the same time, some people have managed to successfully enroll, though the insider couldn\u2019t put an exact count on how many. Fixing the problems At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney gave reporters the most detailed account yet of steps being taken to address the website problems that have included long delays, difficulties signing in and incorrect information getting relayed to insurance companies. \u201cWe are making fixes to the existing system,\u201d Carney said, noting that developers were increasing the bandwidth and \u201cimproving site architecture\u201d to deal with the volume of visitors to HealthCare.gov. \u201cWe\u2019re substituting in hardware to make changes that make it more optimized,\u201d Carney added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re improving database queries.\u201d More tests are coming \u201cnow that we know what we\u2019re dealing with in terms of volume,\u201d he said. Carney also said the Department of Health and Human Services will hold daily briefings, starting Thursday, to provide updates on progress being made to improve the website, one of four ways for people to enroll in the insurance exchanges set up under Obamacare. The others are by phone, in person at sites set up across the country, and by mail. Sebelius: This will be fixed How can healthcare.gov be fixed? Report: Obamacare site failed early test Fallout from Obamacare rollout Signing up the uninsured Sebelius and other Cabinet secretaries as well as White House officials will head to cities across the country to encourage uninsured people to enroll in the new system. \u201cWe are planning to deploy White House officials and Cabinet secretaries to the 10 cities across the country with the highest rates of uninsured Americans to do enrollment events and other grass-roots activities,\u201d an administration official said. \u201cThese cities and metropolitan areas include Dallas, Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Phoenix/Tucson, North Jersey, Tampa, Orlando, Detroit and San Antonio.\u201d Dr. Sanjay Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview Exclusive CNN interview In the interview Tuesday with CNN\u2019s Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Sebelius said Obama didn\u2019t hear that there might be problems with the sign-up portal for new exchanges under the health care law until it went live on October 1. The site was supposed to make it simple for people to search and sign up for new health care policies, but instead it has been clunky and, at times, inoperable. She attributed some problems to \u201cextremely high\u201d volume, saying nearly 20 million people came to the HealthCare.gov website in the first three weeks after its launch. Of those, about 500,000 created accounts on the website, far below the millions that the administration hopes to eventually sign up in the six-month open enrollment period that ends on March 31. Administration officials also note that such sign-ups traditionally start slow as consumers shop around, with the most activity occurring in the final weeks and days before the final deadline. Carney said Obama knew there would be \u201cglitches\u201d and said ahead of time there would be problems in the rollout, but \u201cthere is no question that we did not anticipate the scale of problems with the website.\u201d Republicans said the Sebelius interview showed the President didn\u2019t know what was going on with the law nicknamed for him. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus issued a sharply worded statement on the latest development. \u201cEither Secretary Sebelius is lying to protect President Obama or the President needs to get control of his signature health care law,\u201d he said. Rough Obamacare rollout: 4 reasons why Tech surge Sebelius said she is bringing in tech experts from Silicon Valley, as well as acting Office of Management Budget Director Jeff Zients, to try to fix website problems that have included long delays, the inability to enroll and bad information relayed to insurers. Asked why the leading experts were only getting involved now, instead of before the website launch, Sebelius said of the contractors and agencies responsible for the project: \u201cWe (had) hoped that they had their \u2018A-Team\u2019 on the table\u201d from the start. For now, she said, \u201cwe want new eyes and ears,\u201d adding that \u201cwe want to make sure that we get all the questions on the table, that we get all the answers and accelerate the fix as quickly as possible.\u201d Republicans already are challenging the concept, calling it a \u201cmoney surge\u201d and seeking information from some of the outside experts about what they are supposed to do. In letters Wednesday to five technology companies \u2013 Verizon Enterprise Inc., Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Expedia \u2013 House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa of California asked for details of what involvement, if any, they have in the surge. \u201cDespite the President\u2019s assertion that \u2018we\u2019re well into a tech surge,\u2019 neither the White House nor (the Department of Health and Human Services) is providing additional details about which private sector companies have been engaged or whether they are being engaged through the appropriate procurement processes,\u201d Issa said. His letters asked the companies for all their communications with the agencies involved in the health care reform effort as well as with the Office of Management and Budget and Obama\u2019s executive office. Sebelius: Obamacare website problems blindsided the President Congressional inquiries At least two committees in the GOP-led House have scheduled hearings this week and next to investigage the rollout problems. \u201cClearly there\u2019s problems with the website, but I would argue that the problems go much further than that,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Wednesday. Officials from the contractors hired to create the website, including CGI, Serco, and Equifax, will appear on Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, with Sebelius scheduled to testify at another panel hearing next week. Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee has a hearing set for next week with the head of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, a division of the Health and Human Services department that oversees Obamacare reforms. One question certain to come up is why the rollout wasn\u2019t postponed after warnings in prelaunch tests that the website would fail. Sebelius told CNN that further delaying health coverage for Americans who need it was not an option. \u201cThere are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, administration officials will brief House Democrats about the health care law\u2019s implementation on Wednesday, which caused their Republican counterparts to demand their own briefing. There was no immediate word on a separate session for the GOP. A third committee sent a letter to the 11 HealthCare.gov contractors requesting documents, meeting lists, and all communications with the Obama administration on the project. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee gave the firms two days to respond. Delay of game Conservative Republicans who forced the 16-day government shutdown by linking a funding measure to demands to dismantle or defund Obamacare now want to delay the creation of market exchanges \u2013 a key component of the reforms. The Obamacare exchanges create large pools of buyers to make coverage more affordable for the almost 50 million Americans without insurance. Robust enrollment is vital to the program\u2019s success. The exchange effort also depends heavily on attracting younger, healthier participants, who would tax the health care system less but still pay premiums. That would help insurers offer lower rates to older Americans with more health care needs. If younger people don\u2019t sign up, rates won\u2019t increase immediately but It could cause insurers to raise them in the future or drop out of the exchanges because they cannot make the economics work. Carney said GOP calls to delay the individual mandate that requires people to obtain health coverage lacked \u201ca sincere desire to improve the system\u201d and instead were intended to undermine Obamacare. However, some congressional Democrats \u2013 especially  those facing tough election battles next year \u2013 are getting restless about the Obamacare problems. Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas called for extending the enrollment period, while Rep. John Barrow of Georgia wants to delay the individual mandate. The Obamacare exchanges are expected to include about 15% of Americans, with the rest of the insured population covered by employer or other group plans. Trumping Sebelius Republicans, including House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, also call for Sebelius to lose her job over the rollout problems. Some Democrats also call for accountability, but they say the situation should first get fixed before assessing blame and firing anyone responsible. Sebelius said she works \u201cat the pleasure of the President\u201d and is committed to her job. \u201cI think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right,\u201d she told Gupta.

            "article_content": "Federal agents raid Florida clinic of Dr. Salomon Melgen for the second time They don't say why ,but Melgen is being probed for Medicare and Medicaid billing practices He's also been a donor to Sen. Robert Menendez, who questioned an audit into Melgen Menendez flew on Melgen's plane, paid him back after the fact Federal agents on Tuesday raided a South Florida office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor whose past issues with authorities had already entangled Sen. Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen\u2019s West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic \u2013 the other coming last January. \u201cAs this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\u201d said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday\u2019s raid suggests Melgen\u2019s legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were \u2018false smears,\u2019 senator says The doctor\u2019s lawyer contended that Tuesday\u2019s search was the government\u2019s way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. \u201cWhile we believe that today\u2019s intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI\u2019s actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\u201d Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they\u2019d had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim \u2013 falsely \u2013 that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen\u2019s private plane. One of those flights was on official business, while two others were for private reasons. The now two-term U.S. senator \u2013 following his re-election last fall \u2013 personally paid Melgen approximately $58,500 for the flights, admitting he had failed to pay in more timely, proper payments because \u201cit unfortunately fell through the cracks.\u201d Others have also brought up how Menendez raised concerns regarding a federal audit that showed Melgen had overbilled the federal government by $8.9 million in Medicare and Medicaid payments when treating patients. Melgen, his wife Flor and his daughter Melissa have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. Yet in an interview last spring with Bloomberg, Melgen insisted that he \u201cdid not ask Sen. Menendez or any public official to intervene.\u201d In the same interview, the doctor said he and Menendez had \u201cbecome like brothers, like friends,\u201d talking to each other every week and seeing each other once a month until the first news broke. The matter of Melgen\u2019s billing practices, meanwhile, has taken more twists and turns in recent months. The doctor sued the federal government in August related to his Medicare claims, with authorities asking to suspend his Medicare payments three weeks later, according to Melgen\u2019s lawyer. Just last Friday, Melgen filed a motion seeking an injunction to stop the government.",

Paul Ryan? The 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate? He\u2019s still a member of  Congress. He still represents Wisconsin\u2019s 1st Congressional district. And he still sits atop of the House Budget Committee. Ryan has fallen out of the national spotlight since the GOP election loss, and he has remained largely silent while Republicans and Democrats battle amid a federal shutdown over how to move forward on a government funding bill and raise the debt ceiling. Ryan\u2019s recent reticence is more noticeable because the prominent fiscal matters front and center now highlight his area of expertise. He is known in Congress as the budget wonk, the expert on federal government and spending. His colleagues look to him for guidance. In recent years, he unveiled controversial budget blueprints that dramatically cut spending and altered entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. His budgets, titled \u201cPath to Prosperity,\u201d became the defining documents for Republican fiscal policy. Temporary solution to debt ceiling? Charity helps Pentagon with benefits Defunding Obamacare a 'fool's errand' 5-year-old distraught over shutdown After stepping into the limelight of the presidential campaign last year, he became just as well known for his biceps as his budget, thanks to a Time magazine photo shoot. Silence shattered While President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner remain at odds over the shutdown and the debt ceiling, and while House Republicans are involved in infighting, Ryan dipped his toe into the shark tank. He broke his months-long silence with an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, putting forward a new path \u2013 how to break the crippling stalemate in Washington with ideas that even some Democrats support. He did not emerge unscathed. Op-ed doesn\u2019t mention Obamacare Ryan took a measured tone in the op-ed. He placed blame on Obama for not being willing to negotiate but he implored both sides both sides to sit down at the negotiating table. Ryan responds to criticism over op-ed His idea: his old idea. He proposed \u201ccommonsense reforms of the country\u2019s entitlement programs.\u201d 2016 ambitions? Ultimately, his timely emergence could be part of a larger plot. As a young politician with a bright future, speculation is rampant that he might be running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. That speculation grows louder especially as he plans trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, the first presidential nominating states. He will keynote a birthday fundraiser for Iowa\u2019s Republican governor next month and he is to attend a fundraising breakfast for a congressional candidate in New Hampshire. While Ryan released the op-ed, he continues to play the cautious card, however. CNN has asked every congressional member if they would support a \u201cclean\u201d government funding or debt ceiling bill with no strings attached \u2013 something many Republicans are demanding. Ryan\u2019s office has not commented. In new book, Paul Ryan asks \u2018where do we go from here?\u2019 Ears opened If his strategy is to speak little but make a big impact, Ryan definitely made an impact. It might not have been the one he had hoped. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has broken with his party on various issues, championed Ryan\u2019s op-ed. Via Twitter, McCain said Ryan\u2019s proposal is a \u201cmust read.\u201d But not everyone was so enthusiastic. Conservatives jumped on Ryan\u2019s for omitting their central demand \u2013 dismantling Obamacare - in the government shutdown and debt limit fight. A spokeswoman for the leader of that crusade, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, aptly noticed the omission. \u201cThere is one big work missing from this op-ed. It\u2019s start with an O and ends with BAMACARE,\u201d she tweeted. Ryan was forced to go on defense instead of push his agenda. Appearing on conservative talk show \u201cBill Bennett\u2019s Morning in America,\u201d Bennett asked Ryan if dismantling Obamacare was no longer a priority. Ryan insisted that it still was. \u201cObamacare\u2019s an entitlement just like any other entitlement,\u201d Ryan said, according to Politico. \u201cIf you look at the op-ed, I say we have to - ultimately we have to rethink all of our nation\u2019s health care laws.\u201d Head of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, came to Ryan\u2019s defense. He echoed Ryan\u2019s defense and said his op-ed included \u201cOBAMACARE,\u201d even though it didn\u2019t specifically mention it. At a weekly meeting of House conservative lawmakers that Ryan regularly attends, he attempted to explain the position he laid out in the Wall Street Journal. But some conservatives still insist that Obamacare be tied to any deal. Ryan dodged reporters after the meeting. Opinion: Goodbye to the strategy Republicans knew was a fantasy The dilemma Twenty years ago, Ryan worked for the conservative organization Empower America, which later became FreedomWorks. While that organization successfully morphed from a group that promoted traditional fiscal conservatism and neoconservative foreign policies into a limited government tea party aligned group. Is Paul Ryan an Empower America Republican? Or a FreedomWorks Republican? There lies Ryan\u2019s dilemma. It\u2019s the same scenario that is plaguing the Republican Party and also dictating the current debate in Washington. Republican strategist and former Romney spokesman Ryan Williams his op-ed shows that he\u2019s \u201cthe adult in the room.\u201d \u201cHe felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never-ending stalemate that we\u2019re witnessing in Washington,\u201d Williams added. But the conservatives intent on stopping the health care law at all political costs aren\u2019t interested in ending the stalemate if it doesn\u2019t end Obamacare. Lisa Miller, Founder of the Washington-based Tea Party WDC, said she hopes the government shutdown leads to the chipping away of the health care law. \u201cPaul Ryan is a numbers guy; I just don\u2019t like his numbers,\u201d Miller said. Williams insisted that Ryan has already proven his conservative credentials but his op-ed shows he\u2019s a \u201crealist\u201d given the miniscule probability that Republicans have in undoing the health care law. Given the push back Ryan has received, three years before the presidential election, Ryan might have to decide if he\u2019s going to be a \u201crealist\u201d or a modern day, tea party conservative if he aspires to higher political office. Supporters stand by representatives, and government shutdown",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama indicates a willingness to accept a short-term deal, a lawmaker says GOP source: Republicans may have to accept a \"clean\" debt ceiling plan The partial government shutdown enters its ninth day A deadline looms to raise the debt ceiling or face default for the first time President Barack Obama indicated a willingness Wednesday to agree to a short-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, if Republicans will accept it, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN. The president signaled more \u201cgive\u201d to the idea of a six-week deal to hike the debt ceiling during a private White House meeting with House Democrats, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The revelation comes amid a stalemate that has Republicans trying to use spending and debt limit deadlines as leverage to wring concessions from Obama and Democrats. One thing any budget resolution won\u2019t include, it appears, is provisions targeting the 2010 Affordable Care Act. CNN has been reporting that senior House GOP sources are signaling openness to the idea of a short-term increase in the debt ceiling, as long as Democrats agree to negotiations on how to reduce the debt and deficit during the time the debt ceiling is increased. Charity helps Pentagon with benefits Defunding Obamacare a 'fool's errand' Time running out for debt ceiling deal House gym remains open despite shutdown Talking about a short-term solution, Obama told the group \u201cif that\u2019s what (House Speaker John) Boehner needs to climb out of the tree that he\u2019s stuck in, then that\u2019s something we should look at,\u201d according to the lawmaker, who attended the meeting. \u2018Measure of hope\u2019 The lawmaker left the White House meeting with a \u201csmall measure of hope that this becomes an exit strategy.\u201d The president warned if Republicans want to propose a short-term fix and Democrats say no, then the firm ground Democrats think they\u2019re standing on now would soften. Boehner and Republicans are demanding that Obama and Senate Democrats negotiate on deficit reduction steps that would be part of legislation to reopen the government and raise the limit on federal borrowing needed to pay the bills. Obama has refused to enter formal talks until the shutdown ends and the debt ceiling has been raised to remove the threat of default. A senior House Republican told CNN that GOP members may be willing to go for a short-term debt ceiling hike \u2013 lasting four to six weeks \u2013 as long as the president agrees that negotiations will occur during that time. However, no specifics were immediately available about how such legislation would take shape or how the talks would occur. But Republican sources have also told CNN the parameters of those talks have to be specific enough to sell to their skeptical GOP members. So what would Democrats be willing to talk about? The lawmaker said House Democrats are open to hearing what Republicans have in mind with a short-term deal. GOP seeks leverage The shutdown began when Congress failed to pass a spending plan for the new fiscal year that started October 1. Now another deadline looms \u2013 the need to increase the federal borrowing limit by October 17 or risk a U.S. default. Days of back-and-forth rhetoric and jibes between the leaders have brought no direct negotiations, but plenty of accusations and political spin. 'Essential' wife: Furlough may be better Roundtable: Obamacare still GOP's enemy? Shutdown makes a cameo in Hollywood 5-year-old distraught over shutdown On Wednesday, GOP leaders appeared to shift their focus from efforts to dismantle Obama\u2019s signature health care reform, the initial driving force behind the shutdown, to securing spending cuts elsewhere. Boehner, who earlier this year told his GOP colleagues that he was finished negotiating one on one with the president, has called for Obama to sit down for what he calls a \u201cconversation\u201d on how to reopen the government and prevent what would be the first-ever U.S. default as soon as next week. But when Obama invited the entire House Republican caucus to the White House as part of a series of meetings with legislators, Boehner\u2019s office responded that only the GOP leadership and committee chairmen would attend the Thursday gathering. \u201cIt is our hope that this will be a constructive meeting and that the president finally recognizes Americans expect their leaders to be able to sit down and resolve their differences,\u201d said a statement by a Boehner aide. Obama\u2019s invitation was intended to demonstrate outreach to Republicans just eight days from when the Treasury says Congress must increase the federal debt ceiling or risk default. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama was disappointed that Boehner was limiting attendance at Thursday\u2019s meeting to fewer than 20 of the more than 200 House Republicans. \u201cThe president thought it was important to talk directly with the members who forced this economic crisis on the country\u201d about the potential harmful impacts from the shutdown and a possible default, Carney said in a statement, repeating that Obama \u201cwill not pay the Republicans ransom for doing their job.\u201d Meanwhile, GOP leaders were distancing themselves from demands by tea party conservatives to also make dismantling Obamacare a condition for agreement. Ryan\u2019s plan drops Obamacare Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman who was the party\u2019s vice presidential nominee last year, argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Democrats and Republicans should focus on \u201cmodest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.\u201d \u201cRight now, we need to find common ground,\u201d Ryan wrote in the column posted online Tuesday night. \u201cWe need to open the federal government. We need to pay our bills today \u2013 and make sure we can pay our bills tomorrow. So let\u2019s negotiate an agreement to make modest reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code.\u201d However, Ryan\u2019s column never mentioned Obamacare, focusing instead on forced spending cuts to domestic and military programs, as well as reforms to Medicare. Ryan\u2019s Obamacare omission appeared to anger conservatives, who took to Twitter in response. \u201cMuch like White House press, Paul Ryan doesn\u2019t mention Obamacare in WSJ oped,\u201d tweeted Dan Holler, spokesman for the conservative group Heritage Action. Perhaps in response to a conservative backlash, Boehner made a brief statement Wednesday on the House floor that focused on the GOP message that Obamacare was detrimental to the country. He stopped short of linking it to any negotiations on ending the shutdown and raising the debt ceiling. Boehner insists that the government must reduce deficits, declaring that Republicans won\u2019t raise the debt ceiling without steps toward that goal. Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase But a House GOP leadership source told CNN on Wednesday that Obama\u2019s rejection of linking negotiations to raising the borrowing limit meant Republicans would likely be forced to agree to a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling limit proposal in exchange for setting up talks on deficit reduction steps. According to the source, the economic implications of a U.S. default \u201cscares people\u201d to make such a deal acceptable to enough House Republicans in order to get negotiations started. The source acknowledged Boehner may lack support from some or most of his GOP caucus, requiring Democratic votes for the proposal to pass. Democrats planning Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN his side already was mulling over \u201cwhat we will discuss, what we will negotiate over, what things will be on the table.\u201d Obama also met with the House Democratic caucus at the White House. The GOP-led House passed a measure on Tuesday to set up a special negotiating team comprising members of both parties from the House and Senate, but Obama and Democrats rejected the concept as the latest Republican gimmick to force talks before raising the debt ceiling. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats announced they will propose a measure to increase the debt ceiling beyond next year\u2019s congressional elections with no additional issues attached. While many Republicans are certain to oppose it, Democratic leaders hope increased pressure for Congress to prevent a default  next week will cause some GOP senators to vote for it. A GOP source told CNN on Tuesday that the White House was having corporate chief executives call Republican leaders. The business community has called for resolving the Washington stalemate to avoid a default that would spike interest rates to impact the economy. Without a breakthrough, the shutdown would continue at a cost estimated at up to $50 billion a month. Failure to raise the debt ceiling by next week\u2019s deadline would leave the government unable to borrow money to pay its bills for the first time in its history. All the partisan bickering \u2013 and lack of progress \u2013 is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers, shuttered government facilities and programs, but also on Americans\u2019 confidence in their government. Poll: Most angry at both parties Shutdown forecast: Week two and clouds ahead In a national poll released Monday, most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country. The CNN/ORC International survey indicated that slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or Obama for the shutdown, though both sides took a hit. According to the poll conducted over the weekend, 63% of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown, while 57% expressed anger at Democrats and 53% at Obama. \u201cIt looks like there is more than enough blame to go around, and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. According to a new Gallup poll Wednesday, the Republican party\u2019s favorable rating dropped to 28%, down 10 percentage points from September. The 43% for Democrats was a 4-percentage-point drop from last month. Will 2014 election solve anything? Senate Democrats sought to keep up the pressure, holding a rally on the Capitol steps on Wednesday to demonstrate their unified stance in calling for House Republicans to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling. A CNN survey indicates enough Republicans in the House would join Democrats in voting for a Senate-passed spending plan to end the shutdown. All 200 Democrats and 19 Republicans support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached . With two vacancies in 435-member House, 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House. However, not enough Republicans are willing to join Democrats in a procedural move to force Boehner to hold a vote on the Senate plan. Boehner has said the measure would fail to pass in the House, a contention rejected by Obama and Democrats. The speaker has previously allowed measures to pass the House with mostly Democratic support, which has weakened his leadership among conservatives. Doing so now could cost him his leadership post due to the conservative backlash in would likely unleash, analysts believe. CNN\u2019s Chelsea J.

            "article_content": "NEW: Democratic senators propose debt ceiling hike through 2014 Obama: \"I will talk about anything\" after debt ceiling hike, government reopens Boehner says there will be no \"unconditional surrender\" by Republicans Expert: Not raising the debt ceiling could lead to recession, worse President Barack Obama is ready to talk even on Republicans\u2019 terms, he insisted Tuesday, so long as Congress acts first to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling \u2013 even for a short period. At a news conference, Obama indicated Republicans could essentially set the agenda for budget negotiations, but only if Congress agrees first to a short-term spending plan to fund the government and to raise the federal borrowing limit to avoid a possible first-ever U.S. default next week. \u201cI will talk about anything,\u201d the president said. House Speaker John Boehner, speaking Tuesday afternoon after what he called a \u201cpleasant\u201d but ineffectual phone call with Obama, promptly rejected the president\u2019s comments as nothing new. \u201cWhat the president said today was if there\u2019s unconditional surrender by Republicans, he\u2019ll sit down and talk to us,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way our government works.\u201d At the same time, Boehner said he\u2019s \u201chopeful\u201d top Republicans and Democrats could soon begin a \u201cconversation.\u201d Boehner: Country is on 'dangerous path' Obama: Won't 'negotiate' under threat Newt Gingrich: Obama should negotiate Can we tone down the shutdown rhetoric? \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a negotiation here,\u201d the Ohio Republican said. \u201cWe can\u2019t raise the debt ceiling without doing something about what\u2019s driving it to borrow more money and live beyond our means.\u201d Yet while Boehner didn\u2019t indicate any points of agreement, a senior House Republican told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that GOP members may be willing to go for a short-term debt ceiling hike \u2013 lasting four to six weeks \u2013 as long as the president agrees negotiations will occur during that time. Still, it\u2019s no guarantee such a measure would be supported by a majority of Republicans: something that Boehner has traditionally required before calling any vote in the House. A second GOP source says the White House drawing a line in the sand not to negotiate has further complicated matters. Republican leaders have talked, though, to CEOs who called them at the request of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett. And if there\u2019s no breakthrough? The partial government shutdown \u2013 which began October 1, after the GOP-led House tied its funding measures to dismantling or defunding Obama\u2019s signature health care reform rather \u2013 continues. Plus, another crisis looms October 17, when the Treasury Department says the U.S. government must raise the amount of money it can borrow or else be unable to pay its bills. All the partisan bickering \u2013 and lack of progress \u2013 is taking its toll not just on furloughed workers, shuttered government facilities and programs, but also Americans confidence in their government. Looking directly in the camera, Obama acknowledged frustrations with what\u2019s going in Washington \u2013 in terms of the current impasse and all the other budgetary battles preceding it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop repeating this pattern,\u201d the president said. \u201cI apologize you have to go through this stuff every three months, it seems like. And Lord knows, I\u2019m tired of it. But at some point we\u2019ve got to break these habits.\u201d Boehner: Can\u2019t afford to keep spending without cuts While the partial government shutdown is now in its second week, next week\u2019s deadline to raise the debt ceiling has many experts especially worried. Failure to act, they say, could lead to the government defaulting on its debt, spook Wall Street, spur higher interest rates and have other negative effects on the U.S. and global economy. \u201cIf there was a problem lifting the debt ceiling, it could well be what is now a recovery would turn into a recession or even worse,\u201d said Olivier Blanchard, an International Monetary Fund economist. On Tuesday, Obama sternly warned that \u201cevery American could see their 401(k)s and home values fall\u201d and the country would see a \u201cvery significant risk\u201d of a deep recession. The only responsible action, he repeated: raise the debt ceiling, without preconditions. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pay ransom for\u201d America paying its bills, he told reporters, placing the blame squarely on House Republicans. \u201cLet\u2019s lift these threats from our families and our businesses and let\u2019s get down to work.\u201d In his remarks Tuesday afternoon, Boehner didn\u2019t appear to give ground either. The president\u2019s refusal to talk \u2013 until the government reopens and the debt ceiling is hiked \u2013 is \u201cnot sustainable,\u201d according to Boehner. \u201cThe idea that we should continue to spend money that we don\u2019t have and give the bill to my kids and grandkids would be wrong,\u201d he said. Shutdown is a matter of life and death Glimmer of hope to end shutdown? Coping with shutdown stress Key players in the shutdown debate Shutdown day 8: What you need to know GOP-led House, Democratic-led Senate offer plans Boehner and conservative Republicans want to leverage the situation to wring concessions on deficit reduction from Democrats. To keep up pressure, House Republicans voted Tuesday to set up negotiations on the debt limit and other fiscal issues. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a GOP leader in the House, said such a negotiating committee with members of both parties could pass a short-term extension of the debt ceiling while doing its work. \u201cI suspect we can work out some mechanism to raise the debt ceiling while negotiations are under way,\u201d Cole said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to simply raise it without talking about the deficit,\u201d Cole said. It was unclear if his description would satisfy Obama\u2019s insistence that the debt ceiling increase must be separate from political negotiations. Yet Senate Democrats have dismissed the proposal, and the Obama administration has vowed to veto any such. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York called these other GOP offers the latest in a series of \u201cnew gimmicks\u201d that avoid the imminent need to fully reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Max Baucus filed a proposal Tuesday to raise the debt ceiling without addressing any deficit reduction issues demanded by Republicans. The plan would address the debt ceiling issue through December 31, 2014 \u2013 past the next congressional elections. Most Republicans would shy away from a bill that doesn\u2019t specify spending cuts or other policy changes in return for the increased borrowing authority. Yet Democrats are hopeful some Republicans would vote across the aisle to prevent the potentially catastrophic economic repercussions of a default. If Senate Republicans require all the time-consuming steps available to them to delay action on the debt ceiling measure, a final vote might not take place until two days before the deadline for raising the borrowing  limit, the Democratic aide said. Debt ceiling debate: Preaching to the choir Shutdown furloughs about to hit nuclear safety agency GOP to hold up back pay for furloughed workers Debt ceiling \u2018like the smoke alarm\u2019 Such a Senate measure could increase pressure on the GOP-controlled House to do the same. Yet Republican House leaders have made clear they\u2019ll insist on concessions from Democrats before agreeing to raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit. \u201cThe debt ceiling is there for a purpose. It\u2019s like the smoke alarm,\u201d said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas. \u201cDemocrats want to unplug the smoke alarm, and Republicans want to go out and fight the fire.\u201d Boehner insisted that a deal to raise the debt ceiling must include deficit reduction steps that would lower costs of entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. However, he appeared to move away from the demand of the tea party conservative wing of his GOP caucus to dismantle or defund Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms passed by Democrats in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Rep. Tom Cole said, while any final deal must include repealing a tax on medical devices that\u2019s part of Obamacare, efforts otherwise to tie budget negotiations to the health care law appear dead. \u201cI think it\u2019s been overtaken by the debt ceiling,\u201d he said. Cruz: Use debt ceiling as leverage Hagel: Most civilian Defense workers can return this week On the shutdown, Obama and Democrats say the House would pass a Senate-approved spending plan to end it if Boehner allowed a vote. A CNN survey indicates that \u2013 with 18 Republicans joining all 200 Democrats \u2013 a slim majority in the House would support such a move. But Boehner won\u2019t allow such a vote, Cole said. \u201cHe basically said we\u2019re going to have a negotiation,\u201d the Oklahoma Republican said. Poll: Most angry at both parties While the two parties blame each other in Washington, outside the capital few get off easy.

            "article_content": "NEW: Debt limit \"a dangerous political football,\" White House says Boehner says \"clean\" spending bill can't pass; Obama says prove it Investors nervous over fiscal impasse as stocks fall on Wall Street CNN/ORC poll shows rising public anger with both sides Is it a glimmer of hope, or more rhetoric as the deadline for possible government default gets closer? After weeks of near silence without any hint of a potential compromise between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans over raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, the White House may be offering some conciliatory language that could help lead to a deal to prevent a potential default on October 17. As recently as Friday, White House officials declined to specify any demand for the length of a deal to increase the nation\u2019s debt ceiling. Then on Monday, a White House official said it was up to Congress to decide how long the debt ceiling increase should last. \u201cIt is up to Congress to pass a debt limit increase, and up to them for how long and when they want to deal with this again,\u201d the official told CNN. \u201cWe have been super clear we think longer is better because it lends more certainty.\u201d Boehner: This fight was coming Shutdown drags on, debt ceiling looms A standstill in the nation's capital Panetta: Shutdown a 'tragic moment' Key players in the shutdown debate With parts of the government shut down for a week and counting, the focus of ending a deepening political stalemate is shifting to the upcoming deadline to increase how much the federal government can borrow. The reference to the length of a debt ceiling deal caused speculation that the White House might be signaling flexibility on the issue to legislators. However, President Barack Obama reiterated Monday that he will not negotiate with Congress while the country was under threat of a possible debt default. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to establish that pattern,\u201d Obama said, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to negotiate under the threat of a prolonged shutdown until Republicans get 100% of what they want\u201d or  under the threat of \u201ceconomic catastrophe.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney later told reporters that \u201cI\u2019m not ruling out\u201d a debt ceiling increase of any particular length of time. But he said he believed a longer one was better, because it would provide certainty after what Obama characterized as \u201cmanufactured crises\u201d over similar brinksmanship in recent years. \u201cOur position is only that it ought not to be a political football, because it\u2019s a dangerous political football,\u201d Carney said. \u201cAnd you know, fumbling that football can cost you a lot more than seven points. It can tank the economy.\u201d Economists warn of dire fiscal impacts from failing to raise what is called the debt ceiling, such as a reduced U.S. credit rating that would spike borrowing costs. The economic blow and questions about America\u2019s fiscal fidelity could bring a global slowdown, Obama has warned. Analysts blamed concerns over the political impasse for another down day on Wall Street. All three major stock indexes fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 136 points, or nearly 1 percent. House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday there will be no debt limit increase and no end to the partial government shutdown that began October 1, unless Obama and Senate Democrats negotiate a broader agreement with House Republicans. GOP to hold up back pay for furloughed workers On Monday, he repeated his accusation that Obama was refusing to hold talks with Republicans, even with the looming threat of a default. \u201cThe American people expect that when their leaders have differences and we are in a time of crisis that we will sit down and at least have a conversation,\u201d Boehner said, adding that \u201cit is time to have that conversation before our economy is put further at risk.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell later said divided government means the two parties have to negotiate solutions. \u201cUntil Senate Democrats accept that reality, these crises will only be harder to resolve,\u201d McConnell, R-Kentucky, said. However, one of Obama\u2019s top economic advisers, Gene Sperling, told a Politico breakfast on Monday that \u201cthe era of threatening default has to be over.\u201d \u201cIf you sanction through negotiation the legitimacy of somebody threatening default, then that is going to happen over and over again,\u201d Sperling said. \u201cSo sanctioning negotiations with someone threatening default is not going to end the risk of default. It is likely to increase the chances that we as a country eventually default or even perpetually threaten our full faith and credit.\u201d At issue is how to reach an agreement to fund the government in the newly started fiscal year and raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit. Conservative Republicans intent on shrinking the government while trying to weaken Obamacare demand that any agreement on funding for the new fiscal year and raising the debt limit include their priorities. \u201cThe debt ceiling is there for a purpose. It\u2019s like the smoke alarm,\u201d said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas. \u201cDemocrats want to unplug the smoke alarm, and Republicans want to go out and fight the fire.\u201d Boehner insisted that a deal to raise the debt ceiling must include deficit reduction steps that would lower costs of entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. However, he appeared to move away from the demand of the tea party conservative wing of his GOP caucus to dismantle or defund Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms passed by Democrats in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Cruz: Use debt ceiling as leverage \u201cMy goal here is to have a serious conversation about those things that are driving the deficit and driving the debt up,\u201d Boehner said, noting that the retirement of the \u201cbaby boomer\u201d generation will strain Social Security and Medicare beyond the breaking point if no remedial steps are taken. \u201cIt is time to deal with America\u2019s problems,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can you raise the debt limit and do nothing about the underlying problem?\u201d Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress insist that such congressional responsibilities \u2013 to keep the government running and able to pay its debts \u2013 must be free of partisan political pressure to avoid the kind of collateral damage happening in the current stalemate. They want what are known as \u201cclean\u201d measures to fund the government for a short period and increase the debt limit, with no accompanying provisions involving contentious deficit reduction measures or GOP efforts to weaken Obamacare. Once such measures are passed, they say, negotiations can take place on a full budget for fiscal year 2014 that began on October 1 and other issues such as reducing spending on entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Hagel: Most civilian Defense workers can return this week Last week, a House Republican said on condition of not being identified that Boehner told GOP colleagues in private meetings he would not allow a government default to occur. But Boehner sounded more combative on Sunday, saying Obama and Senate Democrats refused to negotiate on either a spending plan to end the shutdown or the debt ceiling. Senate Democrats are expected this week to take up a debt ceiling bill that would not propose any policy changes or spending cuts demanded by Republicans, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide. The aide said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could introduce a \u201cclean\u201d bill as early as Monday that could bring a first key procedural vote on Friday. On the shutdown, Boehner insisted Obama and Democrats were wrong in saying a \u201cclean\u201d short-term spending plan to reopen the government would pass in the House with support from some Republicans and most Democrats. \u201cThere are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR,\u201d Boehner said. Obama rejected Boehner\u2019s contention on Monday, saying the speaker \u201cshould prove it\u201d by holding the vote. \u201cMy very strong suspicion is there are enough votes there,\u201d Obama said, adding that Boehner \u201capparently doesn\u2019t want to see the government shutdown end \u2026 unless he\u2019s able to extract concessions that don\u2019t have anything to do with the budget.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested the measure would pass the House, and that Americans would realize the government was shut down \u201cfor no apparent reason.\u201d Both Obama and Reid said Democrats were open to negotiate \u201canything\u201d \u2013 with the president specifically mentioning health care \u2013 once the government shutdown ends and the debt ceiling gets increased. House Republicans, however, fear losing their leverage in any talks by giving up those two points without any concessions. In a new national poll released Monday, most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country. While the CNN/ORC International survey also indicated that slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or Obama for the shutdown, both sides were taking a hit. According to the poll conducted over the weekend, 63% of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown, while 57% expressed anger at Democrats and 53% at Obama. \u201cIt looks like there is more than enough blame to go around and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Will 2014 election solve anything? Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union that the government risks more than its credit rating if the debt ceiling is not increased by October 17. He dismissed suggestions that the government could avoid default by making only interest payments, saying Social Security payments and veteran\u2019s benefits could be endangered. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous, it\u2019s reckless,\u201d Lew said. If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, borrowing money to meet the nation\u2019s obligations won\u2019t be possible, CNNMoney\u2019s Jeanne Sahadi reported Monday. Instead, Sahadi reported, lawmakers would have a few options to choose from that would have to be implemented right away \u2013 cut government spending for the military and other discretionary programs by up to 33% every month; cut mandatory spending such as entitlement programs by 16% every month, and raising taxes by up to 12% every month.

            "article_content": "House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan renews fight to repeal Obamacare Ryan's efforts are seen as a non-starter among Democrats Repeal efforts may play well with GOP base if Ryan makes a 2016 presidential run Conventional wisdom among politicos on both sides of the aisle is that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s continued quest to repeal Obamacare has a snowball\u2019s chance in heck of going anywhere. So when the former vice presidential nominee and potential 2016 presidential contender told Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that his plan to balance the budget in a decade included a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the veteran news host echoed how many in Washington view the topic. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Wallace told his guest. \u201cWell, we believe it should,\u201d Ryan responded. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. This is what budgeting is all about, Chris. It\u2019s about making tough choices to fix our country\u2019s problems.\u201d Florida governor reverses on Obamacare Boehner: Obamacare on the table Hobby Lobby takes on Obamacare Ryan says House GOP budget will include Obamacare repeal Ryan says the House GOP budget will include repealing President Barack\u2019s Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement. He knows this will be difficult, political experts say. After all, Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to repeal Obamacare more than 30 times. This included a measure introduced in the very first week of the current session by Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican and a former GOP presidential candidate. The Supreme Court narrowly upheld the law last year in a politically charged decision. And a poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation just after the November presidential election found that just 33% of those polled support repealing Obamacare. Even House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, acknowledged after the election that the GOP mission to repeal the law would change. \u201cI think the election changes that. It\u2019s pretty clear that the president was re-elected, Obamacare is the law of the land,\u201d Boehner said last year in an interview with ABC News. Boehner left room for a push to change some aspects of it, however. \u201cThere certainly may be parts of it that we believe \u2013 need to be changed,\u201d Boehner said at the time. \u201cWe may do that.  No decisions at this point.\u201d Ryan gave reporters a preview of his budget on Wednesday and is expected to release it this week. He has consistently taken aim at Obamacare in previous budget proposals and on the 2012 campaign trail. So why, in this era of heightened partisanship and amid fledgling attempts by the president to mend relationships with Republicans would Ryan toss the equivalent of a political stink bomb into the mix? The answer is simple, political experts say. He said he would work for a repeal and he will be held to that by the most conservative members of the base in 2016 should he decide to run for president. Ryan\u2019s balanced budget quest \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a surprise. It\u2019s where he stood before the election and it\u2019s a bargaining position,\u201d said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s a classic position to take if in 2016 if he wants to run for president. He knows it\u2019s not very realistic to try to repeal Obamacare but it\u2019s a good way to try and get the nomination in 2016.\u201d Ryan is also dealing with two political realities, said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to appeal to several audiences,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cThere\u2019s trying to get something done, but there\u2019s also appealing to the party\u2019s base.\u201d Ryan\u2019s counterpart in the other chamber, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, D-Washington, is expected to soon unveil  a budget that will likely include an increase in taxes for wealthy Americans and businesses while cutting some spending as a way of addressing the deficit. Some in the Republican base support the idea that nixing costs associated with Obamacare would help trim red ink. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation wrote that one such effort to repeal Obamacare \u201cwould reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period.\u201d Still there are those who agree with Ryan and see Obamacare as part of the problem with the deficit. \u201cPaul Ryan is suggesting, the budget committee\u2019s suggesting what\u2019s going to come before the House before the end of the month is yes, if you want to balance the budget within 10 years you\u2019ve got to take care of the health care expense,\u201d  Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said Monday on CNN. \u201cAnd the problem with Obamacare is it\u2019s making it more expensive.\u201d Ryan backs off Medicare proposal CNN\u2019s Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Avoid \"self-inflicted wounds\" out of Washington, President Obama says Obama says sequester cuts will hurt the economy Steep spending cuts from a 2011 debt-ceiling deal will impact the government March 1 The cuts were intended to force a broader deficit reduction deal that never happened President Barack Obama called on Tuesday for a short-term agreement to put off deep cuts to government spending, including the military, set to take effect next month. Obama made his pitch in a statement to reporters at the White House, urging Congress to pass a measure that would offset some of the imminent automatic spending cuts \u2013 known as sequestration \u2013 that were part of a 2011 debt ceiling deal. The president made clear that he still wanted a broader deficit reduction agreement with Republicans that included spending cuts, entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks. However, Obama said, with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown, Congress should pass a temporary fix that will allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan. Obama: Cameraman 'breaking my flow' Washington's budget battle Obama calls for short-term fix Obama, Congress punt on spending cuts \u201cOur economy right now is headed in the right direction and it will stay that way as long as there aren\u2019t any more self-inflicted wounds coming out of Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let\u2019s keep on chipping away at this problem together, as Democrats and Republicans, to give our workers and our businesses the support that they need to thrive in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d he added. Before Obama spoke, House Republican leaders slammed him for failing to produce a budget proposal the day before, which they said is a long-standing deadline to do so under federal law. We care: Cantor wants to give GOP a \u2018makeover,\u2019 change the message In the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government\u2019s borrowing limit to meet its obligations, Congress and the White House agreed to include the automatic spending cuts of sequestration as motivation to pass a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan. Deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012, an election year, leading to the impending sequestration cuts this year. The government has already delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013. On Tuesday, Obama said he still supported a broader deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by Republicans \u2013 such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government \u2013 should be part of it. However, he noted that it was unlikely Congress would reach a deficit-reduction deal by March 1 to render the sequestration cuts moot. \u201cIf they can\u2019t get a bigger package done by the time the sequester is scheduled to go into effect, then I believe that they should at least pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would delay the economically damaging effects of the sequester for a few more months until Congress finds a way to replace these cuts with a smarter solution,\u201d Obama said. \u2018Without questions\u2019: Reid says more revenue needed to fix budget problems Earlier, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, reacted to news of Obama\u2019s plan by saying it was the president who \u201cfirst proposed the sequester and insisted it become law.\u201d Reiterating the longstanding position of Republicans in budget negotiations, Boehner called for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and what he called reforms \u2013 a reference to changes in popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A last-second agreement in the previous Congress that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit-reduction package. That measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving Obama and Congress in which other steps to increase government revenue, such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations, were considered but not included in the final deal. Obama and Democrats now want such revenue-raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky expressed his opposition to such a move Tuesday, saying \u201cthe American people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law.\u201d Federal spending cuts under sequestration total more than $1 trillion over 10 years, half of which would come from the Pentagon. It\u2019s your fault: How our \u2018tribes\u2019 help create gridlock in Congress Military officials have warned that those cuts, on top of steep budget reductions already in the pipeline over the next decade, would be devastating to its operations as well as the civilian economy that depends on defense-related jobs and spending. Obama\u2019s push to avoid the sequester cuts comes a week before he outlines his second-term agenda in the State of the Union address. Congress, which authorizes federal spending, has failed to pass detailed annual budgets in recent years due to partisan gridlock over spending and debt, as well as electoral politics. Instead, it has approved a series of extensions of past spending authorizations \u2013 called continuing resolutions \u2013 to keep the government funded. During his first term, Obama\u2019s annual budget proposals prompted immediate opposition from Republicans \u2013 and Democrats at times \u2013 that rendered ineffective the early year exercise of outlining his spending priorities. The plan for temporarily extending the sequester deadline follows a similar move by congressional Republicans last month on raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling. That deal put off further wrangling on the federal borrowing limit until mid-May. Some analysts warn that Washington\u2019s fiscal paralysis harms the nation\u2019s fragile economy and could bring another recession. Short-term approaches like the recent debt-ceiling measure and now Obama\u2019s push on the sequester cuts allows more time for negotiations on a possible broader deal that would address all issues at once.",
