The likelihood of an attack in Benghazi was high and Hillary Clinton should have known about it.

The high court struck down a Texas abortion access law yesterday that critics said pretty much shut down most abortion clinics in the state.

            "article_content": "The one-page memo asks the State Department to outline existing programs on gender equality Initiatives aimed at supporting women and girls are a cornerstone of international development President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has asked the State Department to provide a list of existing programs and activities intended to promote gender equality, according to sources at the agency, raising fears that these programs may be the target of cuts. A one-page memo earlier reported by The New York Times and The Washington Post asks the State Department to outline existing programs on gender equality, including funding, positions and programs on women\u2019s empowerment and combating gender-based violence, department officials told CNN. The questionnaire comes in the wake of broader efforts by the Trump transition team to quiz Obama administration agencies on programs and issues that the President-elect has expressed doubt about, including climate change. And though Trump has said little about gender, his attitudes toward and treatment of women became an incendiary campaign issue, particularly after leaked tapes of him bragging about sexually assaulting women. Initiatives aimed at supporting women and girls are a cornerstone of international development, as they\u2019ve proved to benefit broader societies. They were a signature issue for Trump\u2019s election rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While some senior State Department officials caution that the transition team is asking basic management, budgetary and program questions typical of previous transitions and not suggestive of an ideological agenda, the questions have nevertheless raised concerns that Trump will work to roll back work on Obama administration priorities. A message left with the Trump transition team was not immediately returned. State Department spokesman John Kirby said he and Secretary of State John Kerry were aware of the anxieties, but he added that the requests were not unusual. \u201cChange is difficult for everybody to deal with,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cI understand that and the secretary understands that changes in leadership and potential changes in policies going forward can cause angst.\u201d \u201cObviously, we would have concerns if, for instance, there were issue-specific lists of names that were being provided,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cI mean, clearly, that would be something that would be of concern of us, and would not be the kind of thing that we would want to engage in.\u201d \u201cBut in terms of organizationally where people are, what jobs they have, who\u2019s in the chair, and whether that person is going to be here after the 20th, that\u2019s, those are fair questions for us to have to answer,\u201d Kirby said. Even so, the highest ranking woman on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, expressed concern, saying the Trump \u201ctransition team should clarify their intent.\u201d \u201cThese are vital foreign policy programs that promote stability, peace and development around the world,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cI pledge to work with the incoming administration to advance policies that support and protect women and girls worldwide, but I can promise that if the next administration intends to roll back programs designed to lift women up, it will very quickly meet stiff opposition in the Senate.\u201d The transition request didn\u2019t include any mention about programs focused on gender identity or sexual orientation, according to one State Department official. US administrations have, in the past, incorporated their values into decisions about how to fund development and aid programs. Under President George W. Bush, the US cut funding for development programs that supported abortion. And in the 2000 budget, Congress enacted a \u201cglobal gag\u201d rule that denied US funding to any private development group that used non-US funds to provide abortion services. Two other State Department officials said the Trump transition team requests were part of a broader set of inquiries that included a request for information about the war against ISIS and how many political appointees would be leaving in January. These officials suggested that the concerns being aired might be the work of people trying to taint the State Department transition. They added that none of the questions indicated what actual policy would be pursued under Trump\u2019s candidate to be secretary of state, retiring ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson. \u201cI think you can understand that in helping any new team get a grip on a new organization, that as they try to understand bureaus and how they\u2019re manned, that there\u2019s going to be a discussion,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cThere needs to be a discussion about what positions will remain open for them to fill and what positions they might not have to worry about filling because they\u2019re being filled with, say, career Foreign Service officers or civil servants.\u201d This month, Trump\u2019s transition team also asked the Energy Department to provide the names of all employees who have worked on climate change, which Trump has called a \u201choax,\u201d as well as the professional society memberships of lab workers. Trump\u2019s team has also asked the State Department about funding levels for international environmental groups, according to several sources familiar with the matter. But some State Department officials described the inquiry as part of a much broader set of questions about State Department operations, programs and funding. The Energy Department refused to comply with the Trump team\u2019s request, saying it would provide all publicly available information to the transition team, but wouldn\u2019t hand over individual names. The request left many at the Energy Department \u201cunsettled,\u201d a spokesman told Reuters. CNN\u2019s Theodore Schleifer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "While vetoing \"heartbeat bill\" Ohio governor signs bill that outlaws abortion after 20 weeks His approval of 20-week bill makes Ohio one of the strictest states for abortion Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed a measure that would have outlawed abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected while approving a law that prevents them after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The vetoed proposal, commonly referred to as the \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d would have been the nation\u2019s strictest time-based legislation, banning abortions around six weeks. But abortion rights advocates said the 20-week ban is troubling on its own, the latest abortion restriction passed under Kasich\u2019s watch. Pro-life advocates, meanwhile, welcomed the decisions as a step closer to challenging Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal nationwide. Current state law, which Kasich signed in 2011, forbids abortions of what the statute calls viable fetuses, or fetuses that can survive outside the womb. Abortions beginning at 20 weeks\u2019 gestation require a doctor\u2019s finding that the fetus is not viable. Exceptions are made in cases where the woman\u2019s health is at serious risk. The new regulations, which take effect in 90 days, eliminate the viability test and simply ban abortions after 20 weeks. Abortion providers alleged to have violated the law will be charged with a fourth-degree felony. The woman\u2019s-health exception still applies. Kasich said he vetoed the heartbeat amendment to avoid lengthy and costly litigation that was likely to end in defeat, based on recent case law. Similar measures passed in Arkansas and North Dakota were found to unconstitutional in federal court, he noted in his veto message. Provisions of the heartbeat bill were \u201cclearly contrary\u201d to the Supreme Court\u2019s current rulings on abortion. The abortion debate is more complex than you think \u201cSuch a defeat invites additional challenges to Ohio\u2019s strong legal protections for unborn life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTherefore, this veto is in the public interest.\u201d Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis agreed that the heartbeat bill was destined to fail, given the current Supreme Court\u2019s makeup. \u201cWhile it must have been difficult, the current makeup of a radically pro-abortion Supreme Court required the governor to exercise great restraint,\u201d Gonidakis said. \u201cBy endorsing the 20-week ban in lieu of the heartbeat approach, Gov. Kasich provided strong pro-life leadership to finally engage a winnable battle with the federal judiciary while saving countless babies at the same time.\u201d The new law makes Ohio the latest state this year to pass a 20-week ban on abortions, following Georgia and South Carolina. Forty-three states restrict abortions, with some exceptions, by time or phase of fetal development. Some of those states prohibit abortions after a doctor determines the fetus is viable. There\u2019s no fixed time period in such laws, but the nonprofit American Pregnancy Association says that viability generally can begin as soon as 24 weeks. Other states prohibit abortion after a certain time following conception. Demonstrators took to the streets in early December after Republican Ohio lawmakers passed the legislation. State legislators had considered the bill in previous years but it never passed the Senate. Donald Trump\u2019s election, and a presumption that he\u2019ll appoint conservative Supreme Court justices, spurred Ohio Republicans to pass the measure, a legislator said when the amendment passed. The surprising history of abortion in the United States President-elect Trump has expressed interest in reversing the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, saying opposition to abortion would be a criterion for nominating justices. Abortion rights advocates cautioned against viewing the heartbeat bill veto as a significant gain when weighed against the 20-week ban, and accused Kasich of using smoke and mirrors to outlaw abortion. \u201cHe may hope that by vetoing a six-week ban \u2013 which would have virtually banned abortion with almost no exceptions \u2013 he comes off as moderate. But Ohio women see right through this and reject this extreme agenda,\u201d Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. \u201cThe 20-week ban will force women to travel long distances and cross state lines in order to access safe, legal abortion \u2013 a barrier that many women simply cannot afford. This is just another shameful attempt by John Kasich to make abortion illegal.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley and John Newsome contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As Donald Trump mulls over a list of potential justices, his promise to reshape the Supreme Court is energizing opponents of abortion and galvanizing some state legislators to advance and defend more restrictions on the practice. Meanwhile, supporters of abortion rights believe they are in the fight of their lives. CNN\u2019s Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee shortlist Scalia replacement could move court rightward on criminal justice Trump\u2019s unexpected win is a dramatic turn in the debate following this June\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in which Justice Anthony Kennedy voted with the court\u2019s liberals to strike down a Texas law that would have shuttered all but a handful of clinics in the state. That ruling emboldened both sides: abortion rights activists launched attacks on other state restrictions armed with ammunition from the court\u2019s opinion, while abortion opponents retrenched and supported Senate Republicans who continued to block President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the seat of the late Antonin Scalia. Trump\u2019s victory means that he will be able to fill Scalia\u2019s seat and perhaps other future vacancies. Some states are taking big strides in their efforts to pass new legislation. Ohio\u2019s legislature, for example, passed a bill that amounts to a ban on nearly all abortions. The so-called \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d would ban abortion in the state from the moment the heartbeat of a fetus can be detected \u2013 usually about six weeks. GOP Gov. John Kasich vetoed the measure Tuesday, but signed legislation banning abortions after 20 weeks. Ohio\u2019s Senate President Keith Faber was frank about the impact of Trump\u2019s victory and the future of the Supreme Court. \u201c[A] new President, new Supreme Court justice appointees change the dynamic, and that there was a consensus in our caucus to move forward\u201d with the \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill, Faber told reporters. \u201cI think it has a better change than it did before,\u201d to survive a legal challenge, he said. The abortion debate is more complex than you think Filling Scalia\u2019s seat with a like-minded conservative will restore the balance that existed previously, with Kennedy often acting as the swing justice on the issue. But should Trump be able to replace Kennedy, or one of the four liberals with a conservative, that could dramatically change the game. When news of the Ohio bill hit twitter, Ed Whelan, a lawyer who is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, noted that its survival most likely depended upon Trump getting at least another seat to fill. \u201cI\u2019d be all for it , except that it has zero chance of surviving judiciary until Trump seats two picks,\u201d Whelan tweeted, noting Kennedy\u2019s presence on the bench. Trump has floated 21 potential conservative Supreme Court nominees, all meant to appeal to GOP voters before the election. One top contender, Judge William Pryor, has called Roe vs. Wade an \u201cabomination.\u201d Lawsuit challenges Texas rule requiring burial for aborted fetuses And in an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last month, Trump was asked whether he was looking to appoint a justice who wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade. \u201cThe judges will be pro-life,\u201d he responded and noted that if Roe were ever to be overturned, the issue would go back to the states. \u201cNot only are Republicans in charge of Congress and the White House, but they are increasingly in control of state governments and state legislatures,\u201d said Denise Burke, vice president of legal affairs at Americans United for Life. \u201cThese developments provide us with many opportunities to advance a life affirming agenda\u201d. Trump\u2019s victory has abortion-rights activists looking at their strategies as well. Monday, The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a fresh suit against the state of Texas over new regulations that mandate the burial or cremation of embryonic and fetal tissues that result from abortion. \u201cTexas\u2019 profound disrespect of women\u2019s health and dignity apparently has no bounds,\u201d Amy Hagstrom Miller the president and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, said in a statement. Hagstrom Miller was the lead plaintiff in last June\u2019s case, and is one of the challengers to the Texas regulations. Ohio governor bans abortions after 20 weeks while vetoing 'heartbeat' bill Six months ago when she walked out onto the high court\u2019s plaza she felt elated. \u201cWe were the little guy that fought against the big state of Texas and we won,\u201d she said in an interview last week. Back then, she felt, Kennedy had reaffirmed his commitment to court precedent, the opinion gave her side the necessary ammunition to fight similar copy cat laws in other states, and Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election and shift the court even further to the left on abortion. Hagstrom Miller was not na\u00efve about future challenges. The Texas regulations, in fact, were proposed just days after Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt was decided. Those in support of abortion rights note that while the election may have emboldened critics of abortion, it has also energized their side. Planned Parenthood says, for example, that it has received an outpouring of support in recent weeks. \u201cAffiliates across the country are being flooded with people wanting to volunteer and we\u2019ve seen more than 315,000 donations with more than 82,000 in Mike Pence\u2019s name,\u201d said Erica Sackin, political communications director for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Planned Parenthood, Center for Reproductive Rights and the ACLU have filed suit in Missouri, Alaska and North Carolina. In North Carolina, the lawsuit targets laws that ban abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy as measured from the woman\u2019s last period. The only exception is for medical emergencies. In Missouri, the law requires health centers that provide abortions to meet the same requirements as ambulatory surgical centers. It also requires doctors who provide abortions to have various forms of hospital admitting privileges. Those are similar to the provisions of the Texas law that was struck down by the Court. In Alaska, the law bans outpatient health centers from providing abortions after the first trimester. Burke said the challenges were to be expected. \u201cAbortion advocates are going to want to test what last June\u2019s Supreme Court decision means,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are certainly hopeful the lower courts will look at the evidence and the long track record some of these laws have in protecting women. If they do, they should uphold these laws.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ohio lawmakers pass a new bill banning abortions after 20 weeks An earlier bill would ban abortions after a fetus' heart first beats Gov. John Kasich has yet to sign either bill Ohio lawmakers for the second time this week have passed a bill that would restrict abortions, the latest of which would ban the procedure after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation. The state\u2019s current law generally bans abortions after a fetus has begun its 20th week of gestation, unless a doctor determines that the fetus isn\u2019t viable outside the womb. Exceptions are made if the pregnancy puts the woman\u2019s health at serious risk. The latest measure, Senate Bill 127, would eliminate the viability test and simply ban abortions past 20 weeks. The woman\u2019s-health exception would still apply. Gov. John Kasich will now have before him that measure, which passed Thursday, and the \u201cHeartbeat Bill,\u201d which passed on Tuesday. The \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d aims to ban abortions from the moment the heartbeat of a fetus can be detected \u2013 which usually occurs about six weeks into a pregnancy. Some Ohio legislators criticized the latest measure. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the babies; it\u2019s about the attack on women,\u201d Democratic Rep. Teresa Fedor said. Fedor proposed an amendment to SB 127 that would have made an exception for victims of rape and incest. But the amendment failed, and the House passed the bill Thursday with a 64-29 vote. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio said SB 127 would harm Ohio women. The bill would prevent those \u201cwho are facing the difficult decision to terminate a wanted pregnancy from receiving the care they need in our state,\u201d the group said in a statement published on its website. The law \u201cwould effectively eliminate all options for women without the financial resources to travel for abortion care,\u201d the ACLU said. In a statement, Iris E. Harvey, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, said: \u201cFor the second time in a week, the Ohio Legislature has inserted itself into women\u2019s private and personal health care decisions.\u201d \u201cThese bans are a deliberate attempt to make abortion illegal in the state of Ohio,\u201d she said. \u201cIf signed into law, these bills would force women to travel long distances and cross state lines to access abortion. For many women, the expense and time these restrictions would force upon them would make access impossible.\u201d Once the new bills reach Kasich, he will have 10 days to decide whether to sign or veto them. A veto would stop a bill unless three-fifths of the state House and Senate vote for an override. The bills were proposed at the end of the state\u2019s House session \u2013 known as the \u201clame-duck\u201d period. \u201cA hallmark of lame duck is a flood of bills, including bills inside of bills,\u201d Kasich press secretary Emmalee Kalmbach told CNN,  referring to a larger child abuse bill within which the \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d is contained. \u201cWe will closely examine everything we receive.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s election, and a presumption that he\u2019ll appoint conservative Supreme Court justices, spurred Ohio Republicans to pass the \u201cHeartbeat Bill,\u201d which would effectively be the nation\u2019s strictest time-based abortion law, according to a legislator. State legislators had considered the bill in previous years but it never passed the Senate. A visual guide: Abortion in America \u201cOne, a new President, new Supreme Court justice appointees change the dynamic, and that there was a consensus in our caucus to move forward,\u201d Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, a Republican from Celina, told reporters Tuesday. Asked if he thought the bill would survive a legal challenge, he said: \u201cI think it has a better chance than it did before.\u201d Should either bill become law, a court battle likely would ensue. The ACLU of Ohio already has said it would press a legal challenge. Ohio considers Down syndrome abortion ban Forty-three states currently restrict abortions, with some exceptions, by time or phase of fetal development. Some of those states prohibit abortions after a doctor determines the fetus is viable. There\u2019s no fixed time period in such laws, but the nonprofit American Pregnancy Association says that viability generally can begin as soon as 24 weeks. Other states prohibit abortion after a certain time following conception \u2013 as soon as 20 weeks in some states. Because heartbeats develop at around six weeks, Ohio\u2019s \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d appears to offer what would be the country\u2019s shortest window for abortions. At least two other states \u2013 Arkansas and North Dakota \u2013 passed fetal heartbeat abortion laws. But those measures were found to be unconstitutional in federal court. Kalmbach, a former Ohio Right to Life staffer, said previously the governor does not typically comment on pending legislation. Earlier this year, Kasich told CNN that he was \u201cpro-life with the exceptions of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\u201d Kasich signed the state\u2019s current viability restriction in 2011. Kasich: Planned Parenthood 'discredited itself' And earlier this year, Kasich signed a bill to ban the state from contracting for health services with any organization that performs or promotes abortions \u2013 a measure widely seen as a way to defund Planned Parenthood. The Columbus Dispatch and the Cleveland Plain Dealer have reported that Kasich expressed concerns about previous attempts to pass a \u201cHeartbeat Bill,\u201d including that it may not withstand legal challenges. Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, has said his group is neutral on the heartbeat bill because it doesn\u2019t believe the measure would hold up in federal court. \u201cWe believe in an incremental approach,\u201d Gonidakis has said. \u201cWhen you overreach, sometimes the courts get the last say. There\u2019s a reason why no state has a \u2018Heartbeat Bill\u2019 yet.\u201d Gonidakis previously said he believes the 20-week bill has a greater chance of surviving court challenges, in part because other states have such a restriction. The ACLU of Ohio tweeted this week: \u201cJust a reminder, if the unconstitutional #HeartBeatBill passes and becomes law, we will challenge it in court.\u201d #stopthebans #ohgovxmas @ProChoiceOH @WHOohio @OhioRCRC pic.twitter.com/djlNG0aStF Ohio state Sen. Joe Schiavoni, a Democrat from Boardman, said that the heartbeat bill would lead to \u201cexpensive lawsuits\u201d that would divert resources away from more pressing issues like the opioid crisis. \u201cTo the taxpayers of Ohio, I am sorry that your money will have to be used to defend this bill in the court system.\u201d John Fortney, a spokesman for the Senate\u2019s Republican caucus, has said that \u201cas far as the threat of abortion advocates suing, we don\u2019t base our decisions on protecting the lives of babies on the threat of someone threatening to file a lawsuit.\u201d President-elect Trump has expressed interest in reversing the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark decision that made abortion legal nationwide. The abortion laws you don't hear about Trump will get to nominate at least one justice during his term to fill the seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. Scalia was known for dissenting opinions on abortion rights. In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last month, Trump said opposition to abortion would be a criteria for nominating justices. \u201cThe judges will be pro-life,\u201d he said. But replacing Scalia with someone of the same mold alone may not change the status quo. In June, the Supreme Court ruled 5-3 against a Texas abortion access law that opponents argued would have shut down all but a handful of clinics, with perennial swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy joining the court\u2019s four liberal justices.

            "article_content": "There are 4,581 registered Democrats in Elliott County, outnumbering the 429 Republicans Through folded green valleys and down roads paved atop mountain ridges sits a place like many others in this impoverished and beautiful region. But one thing is not the same. The basic makeup of Elliott County \u2013 nearly 100% white, one-third in poverty and land-locked by deeply conservative counties \u2013 belies a truly incredible fact: It has never once voted for a Republican for president. No county in America has a Democratic streak as long as this improbable one in eastern Kentucky, which started voting for Democrats back when being a Democrat was an entirely different thing. Consider it: They voted for Barack Obama twice, for Bill Clinton twice, and a combined six times against George W. Bush, his father and Ronald Reagan. It\u2019s not the kind of big county that will swing elections. There are just 4,581 registered Democrats in Elliott County. They far outnumber the 429 registered Republicans. They are either the greatest political anomaly in the country, or they value tradition so much that they resisted the countless generational and political shifts of the 147 years since the county\u2019s founding. Never mind all of that \u2014 they voted for Donald Trump 70%-26%. This is a place where tradition rules \u2013 where folks inherit their family\u2019s politics along with the land. \u201cWhen my daddy took me to register to vote, he said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to tell you how to vote,\u2019 but he said, \u2018Our family has always been Democratic,\u2019\u201d said Judy Pennington, 71, in the diner she and her husband opened here more than four decades ago. \u201cI knew then: Vote Democrat.\u201d And so it goes here in town. People can trace their Democratic roots back two generations to their fathers and grandfathers, many of whom had never received a paycheck until they were hired by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s Works Progress Administration in the mid-1930s. \u201cFor the first time, our farmers or our farm workers had a chance to earn an income,\u201d Gayle Clevenger, a retired local schoolteacher, said. \u201cThey became loyal to the Democratic party and this was passed down by tradition from father to son to son to grandson, and has pretty much been the way we have voted.\u201d It also helps that the top Democrat in the Statehouse is a hometown kid. Rocky Adkins, now Minority Leader after Democrats lost 17 seats in the chamber, was born in Sandy Hook and played guard for the Morehead State basketball team in the \u201980s. Adkins\u2019 work bringing dollars back to his sparsely populated region is no more evident than on Route 7, where in October workers finished a 16-year, $90-million project to widen and re-pave the road that leads out of town toward Interstate 64. The town also named its library for the 16-term state legislator, who got the state to pay almost $4 million for it in 2006. The library has more than two times the number of books than residents it serves. Despite Trump\u2019s 44-point victory in Elliott County, Adkins, the Democrat, won 85% of the vote. \u201cThe people love Rocky,\u201d Clevenger said. They don\u2019t love Trump, necessarily, but his victory brings this county in step with the rest of the state, which hasn\u2019t gone for a Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1996. Trump is an outsider, they say, who will shake things up in an inward-looking Washington that has forgotten about them. \u201cWhen Donald Trump said he was for the little people, I thought he was talking to me,\u201d Pennington said. \u201cThat\u2019s when he got my vote.\u201d Gene Johnson, a retired carpenter who lives on a sprawling plot of land in a modest house down the driveway from his daughter, said that despite his lifelong affiliation as a Democrat, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to vote for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI didn\u2019t particularly care for either one of them, but \u2026 I thought Trump would make a better president,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think either one of them \u2026 should be president. I didn\u2019t think either one was qualified enough. Hillary, some of the things that she stood for, especially abortion, our Second Amendment, I didn\u2019t \u2013 I couldn\u2019t vote for her especially (because of) that.\u201d And then there\u2019s the coal issue. Clinton famously told West Virginians at a town hall in March that she was \u201cgoing to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201d Not that the industry needed her help. There are more mines in eastern Kentucky than all of West Virginia \u2013 but the region\u2019s production is less than a third of their neighboring state. Coal industry jobs have been dwindling for decades due to globalization, regulation and cheaper natural gas resources, among other reasons. Clinton\u2019s stark and direct statement haunted her throughout pockets of blue collar America, including here in Sandy Hook. \u201cI want (Trump) to bring coal back so people have jobs and everything,\u201d said Dale Adkins, a lifelong Democrat. \u201cHillary want(ed) to do away with everything.\u201d \u201cBill Clinton was a pretty good president,\u201d Adkins added. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think his wife was gonna amount to nothing so I didn\u2019t vote for her.\u201d As Eliot Nelson wrote for The Huffington Post in 2013, Elliott County was the sole remaining majority-white rural Southern county in America to vote for a Democrat in the 2012 election. No longer. When Nelson wrote from Sandy Hook three years ago, he interviewed Rocky Adkins. Trump\u2019s political earthquake was barely a quiver, and the local lawmaker not only thought his hometown county would continue its streak, but that Clinton would carry other places like it, too. \u201cShe is one of the Democrats who in my opinion can bring the South back to the Democrats,\u201d he told Nelson. \u201cI believe that with all of my heart.\u201d This month, just back from a family vacation after a bruising election for his state and national party, Adkins is keeping an optimistic outlook. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that (Trump) can bring jobs back. I\u2019m hopeful that he can get the Republican congress to fund his infrastructure projects,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s very important in rebuilding our communities.\u201d Back in his house, Johnson says he\u2019ll be keeping his eye on Trump. \u201cI\u2019m watching the news every day, I\u2019m seeing that the people that he\u2019s picking for his Cabinet. I\u2019m hopeful that he will pick the right choices, hopeful that he will make a good president,\u201d he said. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d Correction: This item has been updated to reflect the correct number of incumbent seats Democrats lost in the state House of Representatives. It was 17.",

            "article_content": "Ohio lawmakers approved a bill that would ban abortions after a fetus' heart first beats Gov. John Kasich has yet to sign the bill Donald Trump\u2019s election, and a presumption that he\u2019ll appoint conservative Supreme Court justices, spurred Ohio Republicans to pass what would effectively be the nation\u2019s strictest time-based abortion law, a legislator said. Ohio lawmakers on Tuesday passed a \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d that would ban abortions in that state from the moment the heartbeat of a fetus can be detected \u2013 which usually occurs about six weeks into a pregnancy. The state\u2019s current law generally bans abortions after a fetus has begun its 20th week of gestation, unless a doctor determines that the fetus isn\u2019t viable outside the womb. Exceptions are made if the pregnancy puts the woman\u2019s health at serious risk. A visual guide: Abortion in America What happens next for the bill, which would prohibit post-heartbeat abortions even in cases of rape or incest, depends on Republican Gov. John Kasich, who, after he receives the legislation, has 10 days to decide whether to veto it. State legislators had considered the bill in previous years but it never passed the Senate. So what made the legislature\u2019s Republican majority move now? \u201cOne, a new President, new Supreme Court justice appointees change the dynamic, and that there was a consensus in our caucus to move forward,\u201d Ohio Senate President Keith Faber, a Republican from Celina, told reporters after the final vote. Asked if he thought the bill would survive a legal challenge, he said: \u201cI think it has a better chance than it did before.\u201d If Kasich signs the bill, or if he does nothing within 10 days, the measure would become law early next year. A veto would stop the bill unless three-fifths of the state House and Senate vote for an override. Should the bill become law, a court battle likely would ensue. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio already has said it would press a legal challenge. On Tuesday, the Ohio Legislature sent the bill to Kasich\u2019s desk after a day filled with legislative maneuvering. Ohio considers Down syndrome abortion ban Earlier in the day, state Sen. Kris Jordan, a Republican from Ostrander, called for an amendment that added provisions from the House-sponsored \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d to another measure, House Bill 493, that sought to streamline the process in which medical professionals report child abuse situations. \u201cWe are a pro-life caucus\u2026,\u201d Jordan said in a statement. \u201cThe passage of this legislation in the Ohio Senate demonstrates our commitment to protecting the children of Ohio at every stage of life.\u201d The Senate voted twice: First, they approved 20-11 the decision to tack on the \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d language onto House Bill 493. After the amendment passed, the state senators passed the bill with a 21-10 vote that largely went along party lines. Ohio state Sen. Charleta Tavares, a Columbus Democrat, had planned on voting for the child abuse bill as originally presented, but ultimately voted against it because she opposed the \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d amendment and change in language. \u201cI believe everyone has a right to their own body,\u201d Tavares told CNN. \u201cWe allowed a good bill that protects the health and safety of our children to be bastardized into a government takeover of women\u2019s wombs.\u201d After the bill went back the House, state representatives easily approved the revised bill 56-39 on Tuesday night. It now goes to Kasich for his signature. Forty-three states currently restrict abortions, with some exceptions, by time or phase of fetal development. Some of those states prohibit abortions after a doctor determines the fetus is viable. There\u2019s no fixed time period in such laws, but the nonprofit American Pregnancy Association says that viability generally can begin as soon as 24 weeks. Other states prohibit abortion after a certain time following conception \u2013 as soon as 20 weeks in some states. Because heartbeats develop at around six weeks, Ohio\u2019s bill appears to offer what would be the country\u2019s shortest window for abortions. At least two other states \u2013 Arkansas and North Dakota \u2013 passed fetal heartbeat abortion laws. But those measures were found to be unconstitutional in federal court. Emmalee Kalmbach, a former Ohio Right to Life staffer who is now Kasich\u2019s press secretary, said the governor does not typically comment on pending legislation. Kasich: Planned Parenthood 'discredited itself' Earlier this year, Kasich told CNN that he was \u201cpro-life with the exceptions of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\u201d Kasich signed the state\u2019s current viability restriction in 2011. And earlier this year Kasich signed a bill to ban the state from contracting for health services with any organization that performs or promotes abortions \u2013 a measure widely seen as a way to defund Planned Parenthood. The Columbus Dispatch and the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Kasich expressed concerns about previous attempts to pass a \u201cHeartbeat Bill,\u201d including that it may not withstand legal challenges. Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, said his group is neutral on the bill because it doesn\u2019t believe the measure would hold up in federal court. \u201cWe believe in an incremental approach,\u201d Gonidakis said. \u201cWhen you overreach, sometimes the courts get the last say. There\u2019s a reason why no state has a \u2018Heartbeat Bill\u2019 yet.\u201d This might not be the only abortion restriction law to reach Kasich\u2019s desk this month. Senate Bill 127 would prohibit abortions at the 20th week of gestation, except those necessary to prevent serious health problems for the woman. The Senate already has passed it, and the House may vote on it this week. Gonidakis said he believes that bill has a greater chance of surviving court challenges, in part because other states have such a restriction. Tavares said she hopes Kasich would line-item veto the \u201cHeartbeat Bill\u201d language. The Heartbeat Bill has been called \u201cunconstitutional\u201d by members of both parties in the past, Tavares said. Though it passed the state House over a year ago, it previously met opposition in the Senate. On the heels of Donald Trump\u2019s election, momentum for the bill\u2019s approval resurfaced. The ACLU of Ohio tweeted, \u201cJust a reminder, if the unconstitutional #HeartBeatBill passes and becomes law, we will challenge it in court.\u201d #stopthebans #ohgovxmas @ProChoiceOH @WHOohio @OhioRCRC pic.twitter.com/djlNG0aStF Ohio state Sen.

            "article_content": "The Axe Files, featuring David Axelrod, is a podcast distributed by CNN and produced at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. The author works at the Institute. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr hears the same refrain all the time from fans who think his sole focus should be basketball: \u201cStick to sports.\u201d But that has never been the approach of the well-traveled Kerr, who was born in Beirut, lived in Egypt, and hasn\u2019t shied away from political commentary, especially not in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory earlier this month. \u201cPeople ask us, so why shouldn\u2019t I answer? I have this forum. If there\u2019s something important to speak on, then I think we should speak on it,\u201d Kerr told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast, produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. \u201cIn this case, I felt it was important to address not the politics of the election, but the nature of the election cycle. It\u2019s the first time in my life that the election was not about policy, or even personality. It was about anger. It was about fear. And I was disgusted.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care what side of the political spectrum you\u2019re on,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cPeople vote for all kinds of reasons, right? You vote for your pocket book. You vote for abortion rights or gay marriage or you vote for certain social policies or maybe foreign policy. Maybe you\u2019re worried about this or that. And that\u2019s what it should be about. You should vote based on policy. But this election had nothing to do with policy. It had to do with hatred and fear and we had a candidate who stirred that up, and I thought it was a horrible precedent for our country.\u201d The day after Trump\u2019s victory, Kerr went on a self-described \u201crant\u201d about the \u201clack of respect\u201d in this year\u2019s presidential campaign, comparing it to \u201cThe Jerry Springer Show.\u201d It was hardly Kerr\u2019s first foray into the world of politics: earlier this fall he praised Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest and spoke out against police injustice. Kerr, whose father Malcolm was assassinated in 1984 shortly after moving to Lebanon as president of the American University of Beirut, credited his upbringing abroad for igniting his interest in politics. He noted that comments from Trump and his advisers about Islam have caused concern among Kerr\u2019s Muslim friends. \u201cIf the president of the country can make remarks that are hateful and offensive, then it sort of rubber stamps it for a lot of people and that\u2019s scary,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the authority on any of this, but what I do feel strongly about is a level of respect that has to exist between candidates but also between people,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat. I\u2019ve got lots of friends who are Republicans. We have really great, healthy conversations. There\u2019s a respect level. That\u2019s how it should be. Again, people voting on policy? Absolutely. But the nature, the tenor of this election was ugly and nasty and it\u2019s scary in terms of what direction that is going to take.\u201d To hear the whole conversation with Kerr, which also touched on the impact of his father\u2019s death, his time playing alongside Michael Jordan for the Chicago Bulls, and his future in coaching, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

A slew of bills are being proposed, some restricting speech and another seeming to target immigrants. \u201cThis is about outlandish ideas, ideas that are not in the normal realm of liberal or conservative,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. Many legislatures convene in January. Here are a few of the bills that may be discussed. A legislator says he will file a bill that will outlaw all forms of abortion and allow criminal charges to be filed against people who participate in an abortion procedure. \u201cYou would treat the death of an unborn child like you would any other human being,\u201d state Rep.

Wade, which allows abortion, and probably be declared unconstitutional, Nisly said he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cMy position is that the Supreme Court is wrong with Roe v. Wade,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cThis is the state of Indiana asserting the powers that are given to them, specifically in the 9th and 10th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d Trump says he will appoint anti-abortion Supreme Court judges and hopes abortion rights will be regulated by states. Iowa Rep. Bobby Kaufmann is upset that college students reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s election by retreating to \u201ccry rooms\u201d and blocking Interstate 80 with their protests. Kaufmann says he\u2019ll file a bill that will penalize state colleges that fund election-related sit-ins and grief counseling beyond what is normally available, the Des Moines Register reports. Schools would be subject to a budget cut twice what they spent on such an activity. His bill would set new criminal penalties for protesters who shut down highways. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a right to be a brat,\u201d Kaufmann said, according to CNN affiliate WQAD. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a right to protest, that\u2019s constitutionally protected.  But you do not have a right to throw a temper tantrum on I-80 and put my constituents\u2019 lives in danger.\u201d Kaufmann said he\u2019ll name the bill \u201cSuck it up, buttercup,\u201d after a catchphrase he\u2019s heard farm hands use. Immigrant workers \u2013 including those in the United States illegally \u2013 often send money back home through wire transfers. State Rep. Jeff Jones wants to tax those transfers and says he\u2019ll introduce a bill to do this.  A transfer under $500 would incur a $10 fee. A transfer over $500 would incur a $10 fee, plus 2% of the transaction amount. The fee would be reimbursed when individuals file a Georgia income tax form or the proper paperwork.  The state could make $30 million-$40 million in in revenue a year, Jones says. Of course, illegal immigrants are often hesitant to provide personal information about themselves to the government. Trump won the Electoral College but Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton took the popular vote. Same thing happened to Democratic nominee Al Gore in 2000, when he lost to George W. Bush. Retiring U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer of California wants to change that, and has entered a bill to do so. \u201cThe Electoral College is an outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society, and it needs to change immediately. Every American should be guaranteed that their vote counts,\u201d she said. Trump praised the Electoral College, despite having criticized it in the past. A state House member filed legislation that would would effectively not allow women to have their driver\u2019s license photos shot while wearing burqas, the full-body garment that many Muslim women wear, or drive while wearing a burqa. But Rep. Jason Spencer said Thursday he\u2019d withdraw the bill. \u201cWhile this bill does not contain language that specifically targets any group, I am mindful of the perception that it has created. My objective was to address radical elements that could pose a threat to public safety,\u201d he wrote on his official Facebook page. The bill would have amended Georgia\u2019s anti-masking statute, which was intended to ban Ku Klux Klan hoods and robes. Critics say the bill targeted Muslims.",

They\u2019re sending donations to Planned Parenthood in the name of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who has called for cutting off federal funds to the organization and \u2013 as governor of Indiana \u2013 imposed tougher restrictions on abortion for women in his state. Pence\u2019s controversies have often paled in comparison to those of his running mate, but many people unhappy with the election results have made an effort to include him in their protests nonetheless. Instagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public. Bethany Cosentino of the band Best Coast was one of the first to bring wide attention to the campaign. Soon after, other celebrities such as Amy Schumer and Amber Tamblyn followed suit. Donations to Planned Parenthood have begun to swell, with many on social media donating and voicing their approval. Even if it meant digging deep for funds. Planned Parenthood even took note, thanking supporters for their donations in Pence\u2019s name. Thank you so much! We've been blown away by the support we've received. Many people are donating in Clinton or Pence's name. #WeWontGoBack In a news release sent out on Tuesday, Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky said that the office has seen more than $25,000 from nearly 1,400 donations come through since Election Day. According to Ali Slocum, PPINK\u2019s Communications Director, it\u2019s looking like \u201calmost 90 percent\u201d of the donations have been made under Pence\u2019s name. She said that Pence will receive notifications of the donations made to PPINK in his honor at his office in the Indiana Statehouse. CNN calls to Pence\u2019s office were not immediately returned.",

            "article_content": "Trump said the same-sex marriage decision is 'settled' law But on Roe v Wade, he left the door open to changes or reversal The inconsistencies could trouble conservatives opposed to the justification of both rulings For the first time since winning the election, Donald Trump has weighed in on two of the most controversial social issues the Supreme Court has taken on ever: gay marriage, and abortion. His answers could leave conservatives worried. John Roberts gets another chance for a conservative legacy Trump indicated he\u2019s \u201cfine\u201d with the high court\u2019s opinion legalizing same-sex marriage and called it \u201csettled,\u201d but committed to appointing justices who want to change the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling affirming abortion rights. Who will Trump pick for the Supreme Court? The inconsistency in the question \u2013 what is settled law? \u2013  is sure to concern judicial conservatives who fear he may not live up to his promise to fill the empty Supreme Court seat with someone in the mold of their hero, Justice Antonin Scalia. Above all else, judicial conservatives hope that Trump\u2019s eventual nominees to the Court will apply the Constitution as they believe it is written and enforce the limits on government power. They see both the 2015 same-sex marriage ruling \u2013 Obergefell v. Hodges \u2013 and Roe v. Wade as total failures in that regard. The fact that Trump interprets the cases differently might be some cause of concern. \u201cConservative legal scholars have long criticized Roe v. Wade for many of the same reasons that they\u2019ve criticized the gay marriage decision. It\u2019s not at all clear what interpretation of the Constitution leads to the marriage decision, but not a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law and a CNN contributor. Supreme Court justices build off of precedent, and are often wary of overturning prior decisions in order to seek stability and continuity in the law. It\u2019s a legal principle called \u201cstare decisis,\u201d which roughly translates into \u201cto stand by things decided.\u201d But those reversals do occur. Of all the justices on the court, Justice Clarence Thomas gives the least deference to stare decisis. On the one hand, Trump told Leslie Stahl during an interview aired Sunday on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the issue of marriage equality, \u201cwas already settled.\u201d Ruth Bader Ginsburg, failed political pundit \u201cYou have these cases that have already gone to the Supreme Court. They\u2019ve been settled, and I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d Trump said. But on abortion, he thought differently. When Stahl pushed him on the topic, rather than saying the 43-year-old Roe v Wade ruling is \u201csettled,\u201d Trump said that the justice or justices he appoints to the bench will be \u201cpro life,\u201d leaving open the possibility it could be overturned. He said that if the decision is overturned, the issue will be returned to the states. \u201cThen some women won\u2019t be able to get an abortion,\u201d Stahl pressed. \u201cYeah. Well perhaps they have to go to another state,\u201d Trump responded. Trump \u2013 with the help of conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society \u2013 has put forward a list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees. Many of the judges on that list might not see a difference between the Roe decision and Obergefell. On abortion, it\u2019s not so much about being \u201cpro life\u201d as it is about interpreting the Constitution with an originalist\u2019s approach. Judicial conservatives, like Thomas and Scalia, reject the core holding in Roe that there is a right to privacy in the Constitution that would protect a woman\u2019s right to abortion. And on the issue of gay marriage, they reject the notion that the Constitution limits the ability of states to restrict same-sex marriage. Scalia himself wrote a scathing dissent in Obergefell case. \u201cToday\u2019s decree says that my Ruler and the Rule of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves,\u201d Scalia added. Josh Blackman an associate professor of Law at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said that Trump\u2019s remarks are not entirely clear but could be understood to suggest that even though Roe v. Wade was decided years ago, it is still quite contested. \u201cBy contrast, Obergefell \u2013 as it relates to same-sex marriage \u2013 has largely been accepted as settled,\u201d he said, noting the exception of Kim Davis and other clerks who have refused to issue marriage certificates. That means that while same-sex marriage itself might not be coming back to the Supreme Court any time soon, restrictions to abortion, meant to narrow Roe, could very well return to the court sooner rather than later.",

            "article_content": "Around two million Latinos are registered to vote in Florida, according a City University Of New York study The study adds that Latinos will cast about 20% of the votes in Florida The sound of Christian Latin pop music fills the air inside Ministerio Apostolico Avance Misionero, a Christian church on a recent evening in South Daytona Beach, Florida. The lyrics profess love and faith in Jesus Christ while devout believers raise their hands to the heavens, signaling the start of Wednesday night service. Ministerio Apostolico serves the growing Hispanic community in the Daytona Beach area, the starting point of the so-called Highway I-4 corridor stretching from Tampa on the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean with Orlando in between. This region is home to the second largest and more diverse concentration of Latinos in Florida after Miami and the southern part of the state where Cuban Americans are the majority. \u201cWe have people from about 15 cultures in our congregation,\u201d says Yoan Hechavarria, the head of this church, who said Ministerio Daytona is part of a much larger church based in Jacksonville. And while politics are not part of the pastor\u2019s sermon, Hechavarria admits the presidential election is part of the conversation before and after the service. \u201cWe have an obligation to be in tune and to be informed about the politics of our country,\u201d Hechavarria says. RELATED: These Americans would live in the shadow of a Trump wall Around 2 million Latinos are registered registered to vote in Florida, according to a study by the City University Of New York commissioned by CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. The study adds that Latinos will cast about 20% of the votes in that state on November 8, and that some 500,000 of those votes will come from the I-4 corridor. The number of evangelical Latinos is rising. A report by Pew Research Center found in 2013 that 16% of Latinos identify as evangelicals an increase from 2010 when only 13% did according to the CUNY study. That growth would be good news for the GOP who generally speaking enjoys the backing of the religious right. In 2006, the Republican Party enjoyed a lead among Latino voters in Florida. Back then 37% of the Latino electorate was registered as Republican. This year Republican affiliation has dropped to 26% compared to almost 39% registered as Democrats and 33% registered as independent. RELATED: Political Prediction Market: Clinton\u2019s chances for the White House dip But the conservative values championed by the Republican Party that appeal to evangelicals could be lost this year by the party\u2019s nominee for president. Hechavarria adds that his church members are confused because neither presidential candidate offers them a clear choice. \u201cAs Christians we are usually more inclined to follow the Republican party, but Donald Trump doesn\u2019t seem to represent our values,\u201d Hechavarria says, adding that while he thinks Hillary Clinton seems to be qualified to occupy the White House, her views on social issues are not aligned with his, particularly on abortion and same-sex marriage issues. Harry de Jesus, an army veteran who worships at Ministerio Apostolico, says national security and veteran\u2019s care are top priorities for him in choosing a president and thinks Trump would be better at handling them, but he rejects the offensive comments Trump has made about woman and immigrants. \u201cAs the father of a girls I can\u2019t condone him,\u201d he says. But Clinton should not see De Jesus\u2019 rejection of Trump as a vote for her. He says that besides disagreeing with her on abortion and same-sex marriage, he didn\u2019t find her to be honest even before she ran for president. Reality Check: Trump on Clinton allowing abortions \u2018in the 9th month, on the final day\u2019 \u201cShe is hiding a lot behind the curtains,\u201d he said. Samuel Peinand, who also attends Ministerio Apostolico, also finds Clinton to be dishonest but is willing to give her a chance. \u201cI am inclined to vote for her because of her experience, not her ideas,\u201d he said. RELATED: Bracing for the final stretch But not everybody is rejecting Trump. Carmen Santiago thinks the Republican candidate can change if elected president. \u201cI believe the Almighty can transform anyone and it Trump confesses before Him, The Lord will change his ways,\u201d Santiago says. Perhaps the biggest challenge for both parties this year is to get people to the polls. 20-year-old Coraly Rivera is one of the singers in Ministerio Apostolico choir and her voice can be heard at church gatherings. But her political voice won\u2019t be heard this November: she believes no candidate, even those from third parties, has done anything to earn her trust. \u201cI know I have a responsibility as a citizen but none of the candidates match my beliefs,\u201d Rivera said. One thing they all agree on is that whomever is sworn in next January as president, they will be praying for his or her success.",

            "article_content": "CNN talked to young voters across the political spectrum in battleground states Not many were finding inspiration from their choices Imagine this is your first election. It\u2019s the first time you have a real voice and your choices are Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.\u00a0You think, \u201cReally?\u201d It\u2019s a feeling that binds a lot of first-time voters \u2013 many of them millennials \u2013 left, right and center, who are looking for inspiration and not finding it. They\u2019ll sway elections when they start to vote. Both millennials and baby boomers make up about 31% of the population, although the younger group slightly outnumbers the older. But the more senior generation traditionally votes in much greater numbers. In 2012 only 46% of eligible millennial voters cast a ballot, but 63% of boomers told Pew Research they went to the polls. We visited three of this election\u2019s \u201cbattleground\u201d states \u2013 Ohio, Florida and North Carolina \u2013 and sat down with millennials whose futures are at stake.\u00a0Most said they are not excited to vote and are unhappy with their choices in 2016, which for many is their introduction to politics. Devon Leasure is driven; she is on track to graduate from college in the middle of her junior year and hopes to start on her master\u2019s degree in business immediately thereafter. She is poised, smart and personable. She is a Republican with a capitol R and is a proud member of the Selfie Generation, another term for millennials. \u201cAs a generation we are individualistic, we are concerned with ourselves, our job security, our paycheck. What\u2019s good for me? Not what\u2019s good for everyone, what\u2019s good for me right now, today?\u201d Leasure explained to us at her sorority house, where she\u2019s vice president. \u201cA lot of people forget that that\u2019s what the Republican party is about.\u201d This sentiment was echoed by some of her friends and sorority sisters at the University of Florida. While Leasure has left-leaning friends, most of the ones we met grew up in GOP homes, are themselves Republican and plan to vote for Donald Trump. They aren\u2019t thrilled by his campaign and say his rhetoric is extreme and can be offensive. But they are impressed by what they describe as Trump\u2019s solid track record of creating jobs \u2013 something this group, which will soon be on the job market, finds particularly appealing. A job should be a realistic thing. And it\u2019s not right now.  \u201cWe are graduating and it\u2019s almost like a congratulatory thing when you graduate with a job. After all the money we put into schooling, a job should be a realistic thing. And it\u2019s not right now,\u201d Brianna Frey, one of Leasure\u2019s sorority sisters, explained. Leasure agreed.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m really concerned with being able to find a job, secure that job and then really reap the benefits of my hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cA candidate\u2019s tax plan is very important to me because I believe that you should work hard and earn what you deserve.\u201d But they differ from much of the GOP platform on social issues. They described themselves as \u201csocially progressive;\u201d they don\u2019t oppose gay marriage and were not definitively against abortion. They didn\u2019t think the federal government should meddle in those kinds of issues and they didn\u2019t think that Trump, if elected, would be able to uproot the social policies that were already in place. Leasure says a lot of her peers described their generation as \u201cfiscally conservative but socially liberal.\u201d She argued that growing up with an African-American president, albeit a liberal, really changed her generation\u2019s perspective on what is possible in the world. \u201cAs a woman I feel like there is opportunity for me and that there aren\u2019t as many barriers in my way,\u201d she argued. \u201cWe are just as a whole more tolerant, more accepting, more willing to negotiate change on a humanitarian basis.\u201d Elizabeth Oestreicher is quirky, sharp as whip, and is \u201cwith her,\u201d as they say. \u00a0She voted for President Obama in 2012 and says she is excited to vote for Hillary Clinton in this election. Oestreicher and the other young Democrats we spoke to in Cleveland, Ohio, shared many of the same concerns about job security voiced by Leasure and the young Republicans in Florida. But Oestreicher and her pro-Hillary friends were more concerned about how a strong, united and well-treated workforce can make an economy stronger. \u201cI think that focusing too much on the economy, and not the people who drive that economy and their human rights, is the opposite of where I think we should be focusing,\u201d Oestreicher says. \u201cI think a lot of times millennials are labeled as really lazy,\u201d she says, but she and her friends are active, both politically and socially. They canvass, phone bank and send out thousands of text messages to fellow millennials to get the word out about climate change. There\u2019s more action for the left saying that climate change is real.  Oestreicher\u2019s working at NextGen Climate, a super PAC primarily created to motivate millennials to vote based on climate change influences. \u201cI think that climate change is one of the biggest issues that we\u2019re going to have to think about and look for in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThese huge storms and tsunamis that are happening all over the world. Everyone\u2019s kind of saying, like, oh, like, these huge disasters are happening all the time. And it\u2019s just because of a lot of the things that we\u2019ve done.\u201d This is one of the main reasons that Oestreicher and her friends are voting for Clinton this November. They believe Clinton when she says she is more committed to helping the health of the planet. \u201cThere\u2019s more action for the left saying that climate change is real. And that it has to have something done about it,\u201d Oestreicher explains. On top of working at NextGen Climate and canvassing for the election, Oestreicher is studying nonprofit administration with a minor in urban studies at Cleveland State University. She and several of her siblings were adopted and she is a vocal member of the LGBT community.\u00a0Oestreicher believes that Clinton really cares about protecting the interests of the people for whom she\u2019s advocating. Beyond that, she believes that because of Clinton\u2019s decades of experience, she knows how to work her way around Washington. \u201cI think she has an ability to look beyond her own personal thoughts on things and see the facts and see what\u2019s right,\u201d Oestreicher says. \u201cShe can be as progressive as she wants to be and as centrist as she wants to be. I think she\u2019s the most qualified candidate we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d You can\u2019t wipe the smile off 19-year-old Dal Davis\u2019 face until you get him started on the state of the current election. He is frustrated and feels disenfranchised, like a fake. That\u2019s because like so many young voters, he was feeling the Bern. \u201cI was sold a golden dream with Bernie Sanders. And now since the DNC really screwed him and cheated him we are only left with Hillary Clinton,\u201d he says, referring to hacked emails that suggested Democratic National Committee staffers preferred Clinton over Sanders. We have two candidates who are not representative of the population as a whole.  Like Sanders, Davis is a self-proclaimed independent. But while Sanders has endorsed Clinton, Davis describes her as \u201ccriminal\u201d and Trump as \u201cevil.\u201d He believes that the Electoral College is corrupt and that neither Clinton or Trump will protect his rights as an African-American gay man. Davis grew up on welfare in Durham, North Carolina. His mother was just 19 years old when he was born and she fell ill when he was in grade school. They moved around a lot, at one point living in a shack that he described as a \u201ctool shed\u201d with an outhouse in back. His hard childhood characterizes why he feels so strongly about social issues like welfare and student loans. He fears not being able to climb out of the pit of student debt he\u2019s accumulating from his undergraduate degree. \u201cI have scholarships and such and I\u2019ve worked really hard for those. It\u2019s still not enough to make me feel secure about my life and the future. And then I still have graduate school to go on,\u201d Davis said. Davis is studying music at Brevard College, a small liberal arts school, nestled just outside Pisgah National Forest in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina. He wants to get his master\u2019s in production and to one day to write music for pop stars. Davis has a tight-knit group of friends there who also has mixed feelings about casting their ballot this November: \u201cWe have two candidates who are not representative of the population as a whole,\u201d his friend Amanda McBriar explained. Davis\u2019 friends describe themselves as being \u201crobbed\u201d of their first voting experience but they still plan to cast a ballot this November for Clinton, who they see Clinton as the \u201clesser of two evils.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t feel passionately about what Hillary stands for but at the same time I feel very passionately against what Trump stands for,\u201d McBriar said. Ultimately, Davis has also decided to vote for Clinton this November. He sees her as the \u201cmost predictable\u201d option.",

            "article_content": "Watch the final presidential debate Wednesday on CNN at 9 pm ET Trump's comments mark an extraordinary departure from a fundamental principle of American democracy Clinton on Trump's remarks: 'That is horrifying' Donald Trump on Wednesday refused to say he would accept the result of the presidential election if he loses to Hillary Clinton, raising the possibility of an extraordinary departure from principles that have underpinned American democracy for more than two centuries. \u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d Trump said when asked during the final presidential debate whether he would concede if he loses on November 8, following his claims that the election is \u201crigged\u201d against him. He added: \u201cI will keep you in suspense.\u201d The comments at the Las Vegas showdown marked a stunning moment that has never been seen in the weeks before a modern presidential election. The stance threatens to cast doubt on one of the fundamental principles of American politics \u2013 the peaceful, undisputed transfer of power from one president to a successor who is recognized as legitimate after winning an election. The Republican nominee doubled down on his comments about the election Thursday during a rally in Delaware, Ohio, where he said he would accept the results \u201cif I win.\u201d Trump\u2019s debate performance could doom his chance to win over any remaining undecided voters at this late stage in the campaign. His comments about the election results came during a debate in which he spoke of \u201chombres,\u201d language that could offend Latinos. And he referred to Clinton as a \u201cnasty woman.\u201d His campaign manager sought to blunt the election comments, appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Thursday. \u201cWhat Donald Trump has said, over time, if you take all of his statements together, he has said that he will respect the results of the election,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, although she argued what he\u2019s saying is not without precedent. \u201cEverybody, including Al Gore in 2000, waits to see what those election results are,\u201d she later added. That\u2019s a flawed comparison, however, since Gore\u2019s fate was in the hands of an automatic recount due to the narrow margin of George W. Bush\u2019s lead in Florida. Gore did not question the integrity of the election before Election Day. The election remarks also expose a divide with Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, who told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer before the debate, \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly accept the outcome of this election.\u201d CNN Reality Check Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who is leading Trump in most polls, said her competitor\u2019s remarks were \u201chorrifying\u201d and accused him of taking refuge in the idea that any event that turns out against him \u2013 even an Emmy award that goes to a rival \u2013 is \u201crigged.\u201d The final presidential debate \u201cThat is not the way our democracy works,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around for 240 years. We have had free and fair elections. We\u2019ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what is expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.\u201d She continued: \u201cHe is denigrating \u2013 he\u2019s talking down \u2013 our democracy. And I for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.\u201d Trump\u2019s remark about the election result is certain to dominate the aftermath of the debate with only 19 days to go before the election, and it seemed likely to overshadow the GOP\u2019s nominee\u2019s strongest performance in any of the three presidential debates. A CNN/ORC instant poll found 52% of debate watchers viewed Clinton as the winner compared to 39% who felt the same about Trump. Trump didn\u2019t have much margin for error going into the debate. He\u2019s down eight points in the latest CNN Poll of Polls and is nearly out of time to launch what would have to be one of the most remarkable comebacks of modern times. A new edition of the CNN electoral map on Wednesday moved two key swing states, Florida and Nevada, to \u201clean Democrat.\u201d Two other states that have voted almost exclusively Republican for decades, Utah and Arizona, are now considered battlegrounds. The showdown began in a more civil and calm way than the two previous debates, in which Trump and Clinton repeatedly flung sharp, bitter jabs at one another. He was far more disciplined for much of the debate, and did his best to avoid taking Clinton\u2019s bait, showing restraint as he and Clinton debated the Supreme Court, the Second Amendment, abortion and the economy. The billionaire reality star-turned-politicians did a better job than in the first two debates of prosecuting Clinton\u2019s weaknesses, lambasting her over her record as secretary of state and the controversy over her private email server, and painting her as the symptom of a tired political establishment who had achieved nothing in her 30 years in public life. But Trump seemed to lose his cool as the debate went on, harshly criticizing Clinton and occasionally getting testy with the debate moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News. The debate began to take a turn when Trump and Clinton clashed over the Republican nominee\u2019s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Clinton blasted Trump as a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Putin and directly called on him to condemn what she said was a Russian effort to use cyberattacks to influence the election in her opponent\u2019s favor. Trump replied that Putin had no respect for Clinton or President Barack Obama. \u201cThat\u2019s because he would rather have a puppet as president of the United States,\u201d Clinton said, implying that Putin wanted Trump to win the election. \u201cNo puppet. You are the puppet,\u201d Trump said. Trump said he had never met Putin but allowed that the Russian leader had said nice things about him, and said it would be good if Washington and Moscow worked together to fight ISIS. But he added: \u201cThis is not my best friend.\u201d Clinton and Trump also bitterly sparred over the theme of who is qualified to be president. Wallace pressed Trump on why so many women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault if the allegations were not true. Trump said the claims had been \u201clargely debunked.\u201d Donald Trump's empire \u201cI think they want either fame or her campaign did it,\u201d Trump said, referring to the women that came forward after he said at the last debate that he had never been abusive to any women. Clinton noted that Trump had implied at several rallies that he could not have made inappropriate advances toward the women because they were not sufficiently attractive. Trump wrongly denied that he had ever made such a remark. \u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity and their self worth,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton said that Trump\u2019s treatment of women was part of pattern of behavior that saw him insult a disabled reporter, go after the parents of a fallen Muslim soldier and question the impartiality of an American judge of Mexican descent. Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight She said such tactics were in line with a divisive and very \u201cdangerous vision of our country.\u201d The tone of the debate \u2013 unusually substantial at the start \u2013 never recovered once the atmosphere became charged. As the event wound down, Clinton said that under her economic plan, the payroll taxes of both herself and Trump would go up to ensure the solvency of Social Security \u2013 unless her rival could figure out a way to avoid paying taxes. \u201cSuch a nasty woman,\u201d Trump interjected.

            "article_content": "Watch the final presidential debate Wednesday on CNN at 9pm ET The future of the Supreme Court hangs on the next election, but will the issue come up during Wednesday\u2019s debate? Moderator Chris Wallace made it one of the six issues for the debate, so here\u2019s our list of what kind of questions could be asked: For Hillary Clinton: Clinton is no fan of the controversial campaign finance decision Citizens United. But would she demand a litmus test from potential nominees on the issue? Even retired Justice John Paul Stevens \u2013 who dissented in the case during his final term on the court \u2013 thinks litmus tests are a bad idea. What about the Second Amendment? During the last debate she squeezed in a comment trying to make the point that you can respect the Second Amendment while still advocating for comprehensive background checks and closing the gun show loophole. Will she be pressed on Antonin Scalia\u2019s landmark opinion District of Columbia v. Heller? 50-50 Senate a recipe for 'partisanship on nitroglycerin' Clinton, a Yale Law School graduate and previously an attorney in Washington, D.C. and Arkansas, has certainly praised President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the high court, Merrick Garland. But will she commit to making him her nominee if Senate Republicans run out the clock through Jan. 20, 2017, as expected?  Who is her favorite Supreme Court nominee \u2013 past or present \u2013 anyway? And what is she looking for in a justice? Is \u201creal-life experience\u201d and \u201cunderstanding what people are up against\u201d the same thing as empathy? How important is diversity on the bench? Currently almost all appellate court judges with fancy law degrees. Trump has put out 21 potential names for the bench. Will she? Why not? Garland\u2019s hearings \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 have frustrated Nan Aron, president of the progressive Alliance for Justice. \u201cThe Supreme Court is hobbled and the risk of deadlock on critical questions is high,\u201d Aron said at the beginning of the term. As a senator, Clinton voted against Chief Justice John Roberts as well as Justice Samuel Alito. But should that come up, she would likely note that those two at went through the process and had hearings. For Donald Trump: Trump has developed his roster of potential justices with help from conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation \u2013 but will he pledge to keep to that list? Recently Trump talked about the 20 judges on his list of potentials. What about number 21, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, the only non-judge? Has he fallen off the list? And speaking of lists, will Trump commit to those candidates, or might he ultimately go off-list. Justice Rudy Giuliani anybody? Trump has been watched closely to see how closely he sticks to the conservative line on the court. C. Boyden Gray, who worked in the George W. Bush administration hopes the candidates will be asked meaningful questions about how they approach judicial nominations. \u201cThe next president should nominate judges who have a demonstrated commitment to the rule of law, who will hold agencies to the limited scope of their authority, and who possess the internal fortitude necessary to defend the Constitution without being swayed by flattery or criticism,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Is Trump looking for a litmus test on Roe or Obergefell, the landmark Supreme Court cases from 1973 and 2015, respectively, in favor of abortion rights and same-sex marriage? How far is he willing to go on those issues? Does he think that it\u2019s fair not to hold hearings for nominees, even after the election? Arizona Sen. John McCain seemed to float that this week until his office clarified. Judicial conservatives love Trump\u2019s list of potentials. But his take on eminent domain and the controversial Kelo v New London decision? Not so much. Ted Cruz tried to make this an issue against Trump in the primary; in the general election, does Trump maintain his stand? Ginsburg: I regret my Trump remarks Trump has threatened to sue news organizations and mused about changing libel laws if he wins the White House. Is that a real threat? What about the First Amendment and a potential lawsuit against a media organization? \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m going to do if I win\u2026 I\u2019m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\u201d Trump said in February. Does he think Ruth Bader Ginsburg will have to recuse herself if the election were decided by the courts? She criticized Trump over the summer and later apologized, but that\u2019s not likely to be enough for Trump.",

            "article_content": "Kander has waged an unexpectedly close battle with incumbent Republican Roy Blunt The Show Me State could be the domino to flip the Senate majority for a Clinton administration Democrats could pick up the Senate majority this November \u2013 thanks to Donald Trump voters in Missouri. The Missouri Senate race has shaped up to be one of the most unexpected opportunities for Democrats to flip a seat this November. But unlike many Democrats looking for an advantage by tying their opponents to Trump, Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander\u2019s campaign could actually benefit from Trump\u2019s outsider message. The underdog has staked his campaign on being a Washington outsider \u2013 painting his opponent, incumbent Roy Blunt, as a lobbyist-beholden insider. Kander\u2019s surprising success has caught the attention of national groups. Friday morning, Senate Leadership Fund released a new add, first on CNN, attempting to tie Kander to other Democrats. The ad from the Republican group linked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies features Kander\u2019s face morphing into that of Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Bernie Sanders. The ad will run in Missouri\u2019s major cities on broadcast and cable as part of an $8 million ad buy. \u201cKander is a very talented politician and all of his ads portray him as someone who\u2019s beyond ideology and beyond and party, and in fact it\u2019s somewhat reminiscent of the way that Barack Obama first presented himself in 2008,\u201d said Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law. \u201cThe challenge here is to overcome that fresh-face image and drive home the fact that this is someone who has a long track record and very strong ideological views.\u201d A Monmouth poll released this week has Blunt leading Kander by only 2 points, 46% to 44%, essentially tied within the 4.9 percentage point margin of error. CNN has ranked it a toss-up. Trump led Clinton by 5 points, 46% to 41%, just outside the margin of error, in the same poll. But you won\u2019t find joint Clinton-Kander yard signs anywhere driving around blue St. Louis, and Clinton has spent no money on ads in Missouri, focusing on a path to 270 electoral votes that doesn\u2019t need Missouri\u2019s 10. Trump\u2019s campaign has followed suit, also spending no money on advertising and letting a mostly grass-roots campaign maintain his natural lead. Kander, a 35-year-old Afghanistan veteran and former state legislator, may not mind Clinton\u2019s absence in the state. He maintains that he has not tailored his \u201cnew generation\u201d message to Trump. His announcement video in February 2015, before Trump had announced his candidacy, already included his pitch about Washington needing new blood less beholden to partisan politics. But the Trump effect has played into Kander\u2019s hands. While Kander calls Trump \u201cnot qualified to be President,\u201d he told CNN in an interview that he understands and can speak to the Trump voter. \u201cI understand why in this gridlock that exists in our national conversation, people would in their search for shaking up that conversation be interested in considering someone who is in my opinion not qualified,\u201d he said when asked about the Trump-Kander voter. \u201cSo people do want change, and they want authenticity.\u201d In an hour-long debate between Blunt, Kander and the three other third-party candidates for the seat here in Branson two weeks ago, the presidential race barely registered. Blunt attacked Kander using Clinton only once, to say Clinton supported a compromise Blunt negotiated with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington on Zika funding. Trump never came up at all, and Blunt specifically avoided saying Trump\u2019s name when he said the \u201cnext president\u201d will reshape the court. Asked about whether Trump\u2019s outsider message is a drag on his campaign in a very brief Q&A with reporters after the debate, Blunt tried to make the case that their campaigns were complementary before ending the availability. \u201cI think it\u2019s really in line with the things I\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d Blunt said, citing burdensome regulations on Missouri. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do something about Obamacare \u2026 I think you\u2019re going to need something more than the third term of Barack Obama.\u201d He only mentioned Trump once, to say, \u201cI think Donald Trump is a guy who would return more responsibility back to the Congress,\u201d citing his own push for legislation that would require congressional votes on certain regulations. After a tape of explosive sexually aggressive and lewd comments from Trump was leaked last week, Blunt condemned the comments without revoking support of the Republican. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s statements were disrespectful and inappropriate, and he was right to apologize,\u201d Blunt tweeted. Blunt is getting plenty of help from outside Missouri, as is Kander. Between outside groups, the campaigns and party committees, more than $16 million is scheduled to be spent on the race already, roughly $5 million for Kander and $11 million for Blunt, according to ad tracking firm CMAG/Kantar Media. That doesn\u2019t include spending from groups like the Koch brothers linked Americans for Prosperity, who can run issue-based advertising attacking or benefiting candidates. Blunt called Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser last week to raise more money, and the PAC for the conservative anti-abortion group is planning to spend $500,000 in the state on in-person, digital and mail outreach. Both candidates have been the beneficiary of the races in Florida and Ohio slipping away from Democrats. With those battlegrounds less winnable, Senate hopes have caused an influx of money into the Show Me State. Attack ads have saturated Missouri airwaves. Blunt has been attacked as a Washington insider, including a Kander ad that notes Blunt\u2019s wife and adult children are all lobbyists and accuses him of conflicts of interest. Kander, meanwhile, has been attacked for his F rating by the National Rifle Association and ads that try to paint him as an extreme liberal politician. Kander has fought back with one of the most memorable ads of the election cycle, in which he assembles an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle blindfolded while talking about his military record and support for background checks, saying \u201cI would like to see Roy Blunt do this.\u201d The lack of a strong focus on the state by the Clinton campaign is a benefit, not a drag, to Dems\u2019 hopes of the Statehouse and Senate seat, \u201cIt\u2019s in Kander\u2019s interest to have as much separation as possible, particularly outside of St. Louis and Kansas City,\u201d said University of Missouri-St. Louis politics professor Terrence Jones. \u201cKander is trying to run an outsider campaign against Blunt, and Hillary is another insider as Blunt is, so he\u2019d just as soon be seen as separate from her.\u201d The Kander, Clinton and gubernatorial campaigns have mostly run independently of each other while strategizing on how to boost all of them, according to state Democratic volunteers. Kander\u2019s campaign has been focused on voter registration drives. The campaign of Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Chris Koster, a former Republican state lawmaker, has been working on canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts. And the Clinton campaign has been recruiting volunteers, phone banking to encourage identified Democrats to come join the efforts. Former Missouri Democratic Chairman Mike Kelley was bullish that Kander could pull off an underdog win with the strategy. \u201cThis should be a layup for Roy Blunt in Missouri,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cHe\u2019s not had some major scandal that has harmed his campaign or his ability to get re-elected, and the fact that it\u2019s so close, I do believe that this Senate seat is in play. And with the resources coming in from out of state, with the solid gubernatorial candidate that we have, with the excitement, with the nominees by Republicans, this could be the perfect storm for Jason Kander to pull this off.\u201d Key to Kander\u2019s chances will be whether he can find split-ticket voters. Clinton\u2019s supporters are likely to vote for him, but a winning coalition will require peeling off some Republican support from Blunt. While Missouri has been reliable for Republican presidential candidates in recent cycles, the governor\u2019s seat has been held by a Democrat and the other incumbent senator, Claire McCaskill, is also a Democrat. Conversations with voters in the state also reveal a possibility of split tickets this fall. The Trump office in St. Louis is run by volunteers unaffiliated with the party or the campaign, who raised money because they wanted a Trump-specific office. When the state GOP told them they could share space in existing offices, they turned elsewhere. \u201cThey suggested we go to various existing offices for certain statewide or federal candidates. And we knew that the demographics didn\u2019t necessarily support that,\u201d said director Annette Read. \u201c(The volunteers) weren\u2019t revolting, they just wanted a strictly Trump office.\u201d Read said she wouldn\u2019t speak about Blunt\u2019s race, but noted one of the things she likes about Trump is his independence. \u201cI am not a fan of party politics, I\u2019d rather we have no affiliation whatsoever,\u201d Read said. \u201cI have always mainly supported Republican candidates because that\u2019s probably closest to my ideology, but I don\u2019t like the direction the Republican Party has gone. \u2026 I see a lot of things behind the scenes, and (Blunt\u2019s) probably having a tougher year than most, but I\u2019m not here to speak about those candidates.\u201d Another volunteer in the office, Brinda Johnson, said she and her family are life-long Democrats, and she even went to the convention for Clinton in 2008. But she said after she read a book that attacks the Clinton Foundation and family, she switched her allegiance \u2013 but only at the top. \u201cI know I won\u2019t vote a straight Republican ticket,\u201d she said. Near that office in Fenton, Missouri, at the local Fenton Days Festival, wellness company marketer Jenny Lutterman said she is committed to voting for Trump and sees a need for a Republican president. But she also had doubts about Blunt \u2013 reminiscent of Kander\u2019s attack lines. \u201cI wish there was more of that, that people didn\u2019t vote straight tickets, because that\u2019s what\u2019s happened, we\u2019ve gotten so divided,\u201d Lutterman said. \u201cI\u2019m not too fond of Roy Blunt. I just feel like he\u2019s really not for the people as much as he could be.\u201d CNN\u2019s Theodore Schleifer and Edward Meijia Davis contributed to this report",

Norquist continued, \u201cHe has to his credit publicly said to Time magazine and out loud, \u2018I will never support a tax increase\u2019 and his tax plan is fine.\u201d Madden followed up, \u201cHe\u2019s also publicly said things and then publicly said he did not say those things.\u201d \u201cThat is why \u2013 and not just for Trump \u2013 that is why we want it in writing for everyone,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not going off his verbal statement.

The Taxpayer Protection Pledge, which was launched in 1986, asks candidates for elected office at the federal and state level to sign a pledge promising to never vote for a tax increase. Norquist said more than 90% of Republicans in Congress have made that commitment. \u201cIt\u2019s branded the Republican party as the party that won\u2019t raise your taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that all the issues in the world? No, but it is a central issue and it divides the two parties more than war, abortion, guns. The two parties are completely separated out.

            "article_content": "After a year of agonizing, Donald Trump\u2019s vulgar hot mic comments proved to be the final straw for many top Republican Party leaders. A day after the release of the lewd tape, House and Senate members rescinded their endorsement of Trump in increasing numbers \u2013 and others were sure to follow. In the hours after The Washington Post published a vulgar video of Trump bragging about his ability to grope women as a benefit of his celebrity, Republicans were quick to condemn Trump, but slow to rescind their endorsement. That all changed Saturday morning as top Republicans in marquee Senate races, including New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Rep. Joe Heck of Nevada, said they could no longer support Trump. List: Which Republicans are abandoning Trump and which are sticking by him? \u201cI\u2019m a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,\u201d Ayotte said in a statement, adding she would write Pence\u2019s name in on her ballot. \u201cI believe our only option is to formally ask Mr. Trump to step down and allow Republicans the opportunity to elect someone who will provide us with the strong leadership so desperately needed and one that Americans deserve,\u201d Heck said, appearing with former GOP nominee Mitt Romney Saturday. Trump: \u2018Zero chance I\u2019ll quit\u2019 Arizona Sen. John McCain also withdrew his support for Trump. In addition to the vulgar comments that surfaced Friday, McCain also cited Trump\u2019s controversial remarks earlier in the week about the \u201cCentral Park 5\u201d \u2013 saying he believed they were still guilty in a 1989 rape despite being exonerated years ago \u2013 in making his decision. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy. Cindy, with her strong background in human rights and respect for women fully agrees with me in this,\u201d McCain said. \u201cCindy and I will not vote for Donald Trump,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate and we will not vote for Hillary Clinton. We will write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president.\u201d Other key figures including Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, Missouri Rep. Ann Wagner, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ohio Gov. John Kasich also called for Trump to step aside. Nancy O\u2019Dell, the woman who rebuffed Trump It was a sea change from Friday night, when only two Utah politicians pulled their support of Trump: Gov. Gary Herbert and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz. But other high-profile Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, haven\u2019t backed away from their endorsements of Trump even as they blasted his comments. The cascade of strong condemnations of Trump on Saturday however, could accelerate the GOP\u2019s move toward a tipping point with Trump. Not only are Democrats trying to pressure GOP to cut ties with their nominee, but some Republicans are exploring whether there is any way to keep Trump from remaining their standard bearer. Trump has survived so many shocking moments this year that most pundits have stopped predicting his downfall. But many Republican strategists said this weekend that the tape \u2013 with Trump\u2019s casual suggestion that he could get away with sexual assault \u2013 could be a death blow to his campaign. Trump made the first step toward recovery early Saturday by issuing a defiant apology. \u201cI said it, I was wrong and I apologize,\u201d Trump said in a video in which he also doubled down on his criticism of Bill and Hillary Clinton. He insisted in interviews Saturday with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal that he wouldn\u2019t step down and greeted supporters on the sidewalk outside Trump Tower. It was in many ways the final chapter of the uncomfortable waltz that Republicans have carried on all year with Trump. In key battleground states, candidates and their advisers have agonized over how to deal with Trump, straining to find language that shows they respect the will of the Republican voters, while trying to shield themselves from the stain of his more controversial comments. Republican leaders across the spectrum seemed mostly horrified by Trump\u2019s breezy descriptions of potentially criminal conduct in his conversation with Billy Bush on \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d which was captured on a hot microphone in 2005 and released by The Washington Post. In the most telling sign that the GOP may be on the verge of a break with Trump, Ryan said in a statement that Trump would no longer be attending a Republican unity event with Ryan in Wisconsin Saturday, and that he is \u201csickened by what I heard today.\u201d \u201cWomen are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,\u201d Ryan said in his statement. \u201cIn the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow\u2019s event in Wisconsin.\u201d Ryan reiterated Saturday that Trump\u2019s comments were a \u201ctroubling situation\u201d but didn\u2019t pull back his endorsement. Still, he\u2019s sending a clear signal to the many vulnerable House and Senate Republicans that it is fair game to criticize Trump in harsh terms. Before cutting ties with Trump Saturday, Ayotte was the first vulnerable Republican incumbent to weigh in Friday, calling Trump\u2019s comments \u201ctotally inappropriate and offensive.\u201d Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who has pledged to support the GOP nominee, said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201coffensive and wrong and he was right to apologize.\u201d Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201coutrageous and unacceptable.\u201d Nevada Congressman Joe Heck, who is in a close race for Senate, said he condemned Trump\u2019s comments \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d and that the language he used was \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d  Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican who has been critical of Trump, called him a \u201cmalignant clown \u2013 unprepared and unfit to be president of the United States.\u201d Democrats were quick to charge that Republicans weren\u2019t going far enough. Democratic operatives made it clear that their strategy in the days ahead would be to force GOP candidates not just to say whether they condemned the comments, but whether they believed Trump should still be commander-in-chief. How the shocking hot mic tape of Donald Trump was exposed A number of strategists predicted Friday that the emergence of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape would make it much easier to sever ties with Trump over the coming days. How the shocking hot mic tape of Donald Trump was exposed John Weaver, a strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, urged Republicans in a tweet to \u201cCut Trump loose. If u have endorsed, rescind. U work for campaign, can resign. #Two Paths.\u201d \u201cCondemning Trump\u2019s comments while still endorsing, supporting him is outrageous,\u201d Weaver later tweeted. \u201c#TwoPaths are available. Choose the right one.\u201d Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who advised 2008 presidential candidate John McCain, noted that the Trump campaign has been in a spiral since the last debate. \u201cAt a time when poll numbers are collapsing, this is a comportment and temperament issue. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d Schmidt said, noting that the new revelations come a week after Trump was \u201chate tweeting\u201d at a former Miss Universe at 3 am. \u201cMost every Republican has tried to accommodate the nominee of the party despite things they find deeply awkward. We\u2019re moving into a new phase here,\u201d Schmidt said. He noted that Trump has given little indication that he is preparing for the second debate, suggesting a strong possibility of another flubbed performance. \u201cIf the election were held tomorrow, Republicans are down seven Senate seats, so by Monday morning you\u2019re going to see Republicans all over saying Hillary Clinton is going to win the election and we need to have divided government to keep a check on her,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cAnd people will be jumping off the boat like it\u2019s the end of the Titanic.\u201d Beyond the big names, many Republicans expressed shock at Trump\u2019s comments, particularly those who formerly worked for Ted Cruz, and did not appreciate the Texas senator\u2019s recent endorsement of Trump. Cruz strategist Jason Johnson tweeted Friday: \u201cJust another Friday in #2016. Can\u2019t even watch the news with my kids.\u201d Cruz also criticized Trump, along with other former Trump primary rivals such as Jeb Bush. \u201cAs the grandfather of two precious girls, I find that no apology can excuse away Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible comments degrading women,\u201d Jeb Bush tweeted. Democrats seek to punish GOP Senate candidates over Trump audio While Trump had few defenders on Friday, some of his advisers said they believed he could ride out the controversy. Faith and Freedom Coalition Founder and Chairman Ralph Reed, who sits on Trump\u2019s religious advisory board, said that he believed people of faith would pay more attention to where they aligned with Trump on the issues like abortion, Planned Parenthood and the economy. \u201cI think a 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with at TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,\u201d Reed said, adding that the tape did not change his opinion of Trump.  \u201cEverybody falls short of a standard of perfection, but Donald Trump\u2019s been married to Melania for 10,11, 12 years now. And he has a great family and has a tremendous relationship with his children\u2026 I think this case is ancient.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Dana Bash, Gloria Borger and Betsy Klein contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "The Johnson Amendment blocks churches from endorsing or opposing political candidates Not all clergy are in favor of religious leaders using the pulpit to make political endorsements Pastors across the country are taking to their pulpits this Sunday to protest an Internal Revenue Service law that they say limits their religious freedom. Pulpit Freedom Sunday is an initiative started in 2008 by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Arizona-based non-profit focused on defending religious liberty. \u201cThe ultimate goal of Pulpit Freedom Sunday is to restore a pastor\u2019s right to speak freely from the pulpit without fearing government censorship or punishment,\u201d said Erik Stanley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom. \u201cThe IRS currently holds the power to impose legal sanctions on a church for something its pastor preaches from the pulpit.\u201d As a senator, Lyndon B. Johnson backed a change in the US tax code that blocked some tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from supporting or opposing political candidates. \u201cUntil 1954, America\u2019s pastors had the right to speak freely they exercised that right responsibly,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cChurches were not turned into political action committees and party bosses did not set up shop in the basement of churches. Instead, pastors spoke out as they believed their faith intersected with something that was happening in an election. Pastors should have the right to decide that issue for themselves.\u201d Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to repeal the \u201cJohnson Amendment\u201d should he win. \u201cThe Johnson Amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits,\u201d he said at the Values Voter Summit last month. \u201cIf they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they\u2019re unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status,\u201d he said. \u201cAll religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson Amendment if I am elected your president, I promise. So important.\u201d Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the Johnson Amendment. The IRS told CNN that federal privacy laws prohibit the agency from commenting on any individual taxpayer or case. But Jim Garlow, lead pastor of Skyline Church in San Diego, has tried to get the IRS to comment on this issue for years. \u201cWe record our sermons, as have many several thousands of pastors, and then send their sermons to the IRS in the hopes of provoking a lawsuit. But we have not been successful,\u201d he said. Although ADF advocates for more traditional social issues like marriage and abortion, the group is not endorsing a candidate or encouraging pastors to address certain issues. \u201cADF remains firmly committed to the goal that Pulpit Freedom Sunday is not about any particular issue or candidate or election, but is about restoring the right of pastors to speak freely from their pulpits and removing the censorship and punishment power from the IRS,\u201d Stanley said. Trump supporter Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council, said that although pastors don\u2019t need to choose a candidate, they do need the freedom to do so if they want. \u201cAs a pastor, you have a biblical responsibility to speak to your congregation and help them understand the issues and how they line up with Scripture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re simply going down the list of biblical issues like life and human sexuality and marriage and speaking to what Scripture has to say and juxtaposing that with the positions of the candidates.\u201d But not all clergy are in favor of religious leaders using the pulpit to make political endorsements. Broderick Greer, curate at Grace-St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Church in Memphis, Tennessee, believes support for Pulpit Freedom Sunday is due to more conservative leaders losing influence in an increasingly diverse climate. \u201cI don\u2019t see our relationship with the people we\u2019re serving as one of paternalism,\u201d he said. \u201cI would never want to tell people who they should vote for.\u201d \u201cIf you want to lose your tax-exempt status, then feel free to make an endorsement from your pulpit. If you don\u2019t then, you don\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the broader question is should religious organizations have tax-exempt status at all.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz backed his bitter primary rival via Facebook Cruz and Trump traded personal insults throughout the campaign Mike Pence was instrumental in bringing Cruz into the fold Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency Friday afternoon, a stunning turn of events after a contentious primary filled with nasty personal attacks and a dramatic snub at the Republican National Convention. \u201cAfter many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cA year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don\u2019t want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him.\u201d \u201cI am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz,\u201d Trump said in a statement obtained by CNN. \u201cWe have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.\u201d The move \u2013 three days before Trump\u2019s critical first debate with Clinton \u2013 comes as the Trump and Cruz camps have moved closer in recent weeks. Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee Mike Pence played a key role in bringing Cruz into the fold. Pence and Cruz traded multiple messages, then spoke at length once on the phone and again in person, when Pence visited Capitol Hill a few weeks ago, a source close to Pence said. Ted Cruz fast facts Trump has hired key Cruz allies such as Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager, and Jason Miller as a spokesman. Wednesday, Trump\u2019s campaign expressed support for a Cruz-backed, Internet-related proposal in government funding talks in the Senate. Friday, Trump released a new list of conservative judges likely to appeal to the former Supreme Court clerk \u2013 including perhaps Cruz\u2019s closest friend in Congress, Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Cruz cited Trump\u2019s pledges on the judiciary in his Facebook post. \u201cWe know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices \u2018in the mold of (the late Antonin) Scalia,\u2019 Cruz wrote. \u201cFor some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees \u2014 including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice \u2014 and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list.\u201d A Cruz endorsement could be the last pillar to helping Trump shore up the support of conservatives who have remained reticent about supporting his campaign. Trump has already gotten most Republicans and conservatives on board with his campaign \u2013 largely by reassuring them on the Supreme Court and on issues like the Second Amendment and abortion. But Cruz\u2019s principled opposition to offering his support has given some conservatives high-profile cover. Just as Cruz\u2019s refusal to endorse Trump at the RNC fueled Democrats\u2019 efforts to paint Trump as divisive even within his own party, Cruz\u2019s endorsement will help undermine that narrative \u2013 suggesting to conservatives unsure about Trump that perhaps the brash billionaire has changed, and can be trusted to bring conservative change to Washington. The move marks a dramatic turnaround from the personal insults Cruz and Trump traded during the previous year. The two men clashed repeatedly during the primaries, as Trump taunted the senator with the nickname \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d suggested Cruz wasn\u2019t eligible to be president due to his Canadian birthplace, and even speculated that Cruz\u2019s father was involved in the JFK assassination. Trump also said Cruz should \u201cbe careful\u201d or he would \u201cspill the beans on your wife,\u201d and retweeted an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz. Those tweets have not been deleted from Trump\u2019s account. Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! \"@Don_Vito_08: \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" @realDonaldTrump #LyingTed #NeverCruz @MELANIATRUMP pic.twitter.com/5bvVEwMVF8\" On his last day of the GOP campaign \u2013 the Indiana primary in early May \u2013 Cruz let loose against Trump, calling the businessman a \u201cserial philanderer,\u201d \u201cutterly amoral,\u201d and \u201ca narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country\u2019s ever seen. At the RNC in Cleveland, Cruz gave a memorable speech espousing conservative values but ended without endorsing Trump, as Trump allies booed from the convention floor. \u201cDon\u2019t stay home in November,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cStand and speak and vote your conscience.\u201d The next day, he defended the move by citing Trump\u2019s attacks against his family. \u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,\u201d Cruz told members of the Texas delegation. \u201cThat pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi that I\u2019m going to nonetheless come as a servile puppy dog and say, \u2018Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.\u2019\u201d After the convention, Trump said that he would not accept Cruz\u2019s endorsement if he offered it. \u201cI don\u2019t want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it, just so you understand. If he gives it I will \u2013 I will not accept. It won\u2019t matter. Honestly he should\u2019ve done it because nobody cares and he would\u2019ve been in better shape for four years from now,\u201d Trump said. Cruz\u2019s move may also be politically expedient. He faces a possible 2018 Senate primary challenge from Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who has increasingly made an issue of Cruz\u2019s failure to endorse Trump. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has said Republicans who don\u2019t back Trump could pay a price down the road. And Trump also floated the idea of setting up a super PAC to oppose Cruz if he decided to run for office again. Clinton\u2019s campaign, after Cruz\u2019s message posted on Facebook, was happy to note a number of shots Cruz took at Trump during the primary, including when he called on the businessman to release his tax returns. Clinton\u2019s official twitter account retweeted a tweet Cruz sent during the primary that said, \u201cI\u2019ve released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it\u2019s time for Donald Trump to release his!\u201d I\u2019ve released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it\u2019s time for Donald Trump to release his! https://t.co/08whtFVC0r Clinton\u2019s campaign has been hounding Trump to release his taxes, arguing that he isn\u2019t doing so because they show shady business deals and ties to Russia. Trump has said he would release his taxes after an IRS audit. Clinton\u2019s vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, campaigning in Austin, Texas, Friday, said he couldn\u2019t support someone who used the same language Trump did about Cruz\u2019s father. \u201cI just can\u2019t help but say this,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cDonald Trump suggested that Ted Cruz\u2019s dad was involved in the JFK assassination. Now we know that that is false, but false isn\u2019t, there\u2019s not the right word to describe what that is. It is so outrageously false. And as far as I know Donald Trump has not retracted it. As far as I know he has not apologized for it. And so if somebody said that about my dad they would never have me as a supporter for anything.\u201d Radio host Steve Deace tweeted his disappointment, calling the move a mistake and speculating that Cruz backers may not all follow the senator. \u201cI think it\u2019s the worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. I hope I am wrong. The people will decide that,\u201d Deace tweeted. 6) But again, I think it's the worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. I hope I am wrong. The people will decide that.

            "article_content": "Lawmakers return to work Tuesday for what\u2019s expected to be a brief but intense legislative dash with a short and critical to-do list that includes contentious bills to battle the Zika virus and prevent a government shutdown. The four-week stretch will play out against the backdrop of this year\u2019s unusual and unpredictable presidential election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, which could impact the sensitive congressional negotiations that lie ahead. Republicans, who control the House and Senate, want to demonstrate they are responsible stewards of the Congress and deserve to be returned to power. As evidence, they point to passage of a list of bipartisan bills \u2013 to fight opioid abuse, fund highway construction, reform education programs and even raise the debt limit, an often politically difficult task. By the end of September they must also find a way to keep the government open because a shutdown would be a political catastrophe just weeks before voters go to the polls. \u201cWe\u2019ve passed legislation to grow the economy, protect our communities, strengthen national security, and serve our veterans,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, said in a memo to his caucus outlining the September agenda. \u201cAnd in the coming months we can continue to look forward to making more progress.\u201d But Democrats, who could be on the cusp of taking back the Senate, argue the unresolved Zika funding, stalled Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, and lack of action on gun control, are proof of GOP recklessness and negligence and reasons why Republicans should be tossed from power. \u201cThe Republican Senate will be remembered for how little it did,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said last week. \u201cThe Senate is being run into the ground.\u201d Because the normal appropriations process broke down months ago over disputes about funding levels and controversial policy riders \u2013 related to gay rights, abortion funding and other issues \u2013 Congress has until September 30 to reach a deal to keep the government operating. Democrats want to extend current funding levels until the end of the year, which they say would give them time to negotiate with Republicans on a broader spending package during the lame duck session after the election. They prefer to use that period to fashion a measure that funds the government through September of next year so that if Hillary Clinton is elected she would not need to wrestle with the thorny issue in the opening months of her administration. Republicans haven\u2019t settled on a strategy yet and are expected to discuss their options in private sessions this week, according to aides. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R- Wisconsin, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, hope to find a quick resolution that ensures there is no real threat of pre-election shutdown. That task got much more complicated last week when a collection of outside groups aligned with the ultra-conservative and powerful House Freedom Caucus pushed to extend current funding levels into the spring and not have any lame duck session at all. Sean Duffy to Donald Trump: Don't be so sensitive \u201cHistory shows that end-of-year legislative packages are routinely rushed through Congress and to the President\u2019s desk under the threat of a government shutdown \u2013 too fast for lawmakers and the taxpayers footing the bill to determine what\u2019s in them,\u201d said the letter signed by 30 conservative organizations. But Reid, whose caucus has the power to filibuster a spending bill it doesn\u2019t support, rejected that approach. \u201cEveryone should be alerted today that we\u2019re not going to do a long-term CR,\u201d the retiring Democrat from Nevada told reporters last week referencing the proposed continuing resolution that would last into the spring. That approach might not be appealing to Ryan or McConnell either.  Because if Clinton wins the White House and/or Democrats take control of the Senate, the two GOP leaders will lose considerable leverage if they\u2019ve already passed a bill that locks in spending for several months. Ryan is likely to face some tensions with members on the right of his conference when the session resumes, beyond their reluctance to negotiate on any short-term funding bill. House conservatives are still fuming over the loss of Kansas Rep Tim Huelskamp, who was defeated in a primary in August. Some House Freedom Caucus members believe that Ryan didn\u2019t help protect the incumbent in his race against another Republican who was backed by some establishment groups, and want to have a discussion about the role party leaders play in contested primaries. Both sides are pointing fingers at each other over the long-stalled bill to fund the federal response to Zika, the dangerous virus transmitted by mosquitoes and sexual contact that can cause debilitating and deadly birth defects. While public health officials are trying to contain the rapidly spreading virus \u2013 now found in mosquitoes in Florida \u2013 the Senate will vote Tuesday on a $1.1 billion bill that Democrats have already blocked once because it contains restrictions on funding for Planned Parenthood. The move is designed to pressure Democrats because the same bill already passed the House and Republicans argue it is the fastest way to get the money flowing. Democrats say they will again block the bill. They charge Republicans are holding the Zika money hostage to an ideological fight over abortion.  Republicans counter that the bill provides more than enough money to respond to the public health crisis and accuse Democrats of protecting their political ally Planned Parenthood at the expense of battling the disease. Meantime, CDC Director Thomas Frieden is warning his agency is almost out of the money needed to kill mosquitoes and find a vaccine. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources we need to mount the kind of robust fight against the disease,\u201d Centers for Disease Control Director Thomas Frieden warned last week.  \u201cWithout additional funding we will not be able to fully understand the impact of Zika.\u201d Some Senate Republicans are pressing the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram funds from other accounts to fund the Zika response while Congress hashes out the legislation.  But HHS Secretary Burwell said in a letter Friday her department has already \u201cexhausted our ability\u201d to utilize other funds. The presidential election will be a dominating presence in the Capitol in September. House and Senate Republicans will use the month to keep the pressure on Clinton for her use of a private email server and for allegations foreign donors to the Clinton Global Initiative got special treatment while she was secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey, who frustrated Republicans with his recommendation not to prosecute Clinton for her handling of classified emails, is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee later this month. Republicans will press him about the decision and whether the FBI is pursuing a perjury charge against Clinton for lying in testimony before Congress, as many Republicans believe she did. For their part, Democrats plan to continue their vocal criticism of Trump through news conferences, floor speeches, and other venues. Democrats want to tie the controversial nominee to many of the swing state GOP senators up for re-election. Republicans currently have a 54-46 advantage but Democrats are positioned to retake the chamber especially if Trump falters in those battleground states. House Republicans, who don\u2019t face a serious takeover threat from Democrats, will use the time to highlight their \u201cBetter way\u201d agenda, which Ryan and top leaders rolled out in the early summer months. These policy proposals included plans to reform the tax code, overhaul health care, reduce poverty, assert the legislative branch\u2019s authority, and promote economic growth. The agenda, which Trump has largely ignored, gives GOP members a way to separate themselves from the controversial nominee and point to specific plans they intend to pursue in the next Congress. Two top issues not expected to come up are the nomination of Garland to the Supreme Court and the Trans Pacific Partnership, the trade pact President Barack Obama negotiated that is now opposed by both Trump and Clinton. It\u2019s possible they could come up after the election in a lame duck session although GOP leaders insist they won\u2019t. Investigators on both sides of the Hill plan to press the administration on a $400 million payment that was made to Tehran as part of the nuclear deal with Iran. Republicans charge the White House paid that country ransom for the release of three Americans held there, something the administration strongly denies. House Republicans plan a vote on legislation to prevent such \u201cransom\u201d payments in the future. Republican leaders also want to pass final versions of an energy modernization bill and water development bill that had already cleared each chamber. Senators fight EpiPen price hike Democratic leaders are pressing for votes on gun control, college affordability, campaign finance, and other party priorities but are unlikely to get much traction. Finally, the skyrocketing cost of the EpiPen that got a lot of attention while lawmakers were away will be the subject of more congressional scrutiny as well. Congressional investigators are demanding answers from the manufacturer Mylan about how the life-saving medicine\u2019s price soared from about $100 to $600 in ten years. Mylan\u2019s answers are due to a Senate committee in early September.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Learn more about the history of the ERA and the strategies early advocates used to lobby for it in the video above. Friday marks the 45th anniversary of Women's Equality Day The Equal Rights Amendment has been presented to Congress since 1923 The ERA has never been ratified Friday marks the 45th anniversary of Women\u2019s Equality Day, designated in 1971 to commemorate the 1920 passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. But voting was only the beginning for some women\u2019s rights advocates, who pivoted in the 1920s to the larger issue of enshrining equal rights in the Constitution. Penned by Alice Paul, the Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced to Congress in 1923 by Rep. Daniel R. Anthony, nephew of women\u2019s suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony. Anthony\u2019s 1923 proposal didn\u2019t pass. In fact, it was very polarizing, even among women. Eleanor Roosevelt, for instance, opposed the ERA for many years. One of the major objections at the time was questioning how the ERA would impact protective labor legislation, rules that guarded against issues like unfair hours or dangerous work conditions for women. \u201cIf you have an amendment that says men and women are completely equal under the eyes of the law, what does that do to those protections that have then been instilled specifically based on gender?\u201d Jennifer Krafchik, deputy director of the National Woman\u2019s Party, explained to CNN. 11,000 failed attempts to change America The ERA was introduced in the next 49 consecutive sessions of Congress until 1972, when it passed and was sent to the states for ratification. It fell three states short in 1982. It was most recently introduced to both chambers of Congress in May 2015. The woman responsible for reintroducing the ERA to the House last year was New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney. \u201cAlmost 100 years after women were granted the right to vote, it is past time to enshrine full equality for all in the Constitution and ratify the ERA,\u201d Maloney said in a written statement to CNN. The history of the ERA is one of the major focal points at the newly minted Belmont-Paul Women\u2019s Equality National Monument. Formerly known as the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum, President Barack Obama designated the site earlier this year as part of an initiative to celebrate women\u2019s history at national park sites. The National Park Service and National Woman\u2019s Party now partner to educate visitors from around the world on the history of women\u2019s rights in the United States. Visitors are able to see items from the National Woman\u2019s Party collection, which holds thousands of items from their effort, including congressional voting cards, an ink-and-paper database detailing information on the congressmen and senators the NWP lobbied on issues like suffrage and the ERA. The fight for the ERA today is very different than it was 90 years ago. \u201cThe concerns that existed so many years ago are not as much of a concern today,\u201d Krafchik said. \u201cHowever, there are some very hot-button issues that cause concern for opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment. One of those is abortion. One of those continues to be women in military service, although we are rapidly chipping away at that.\u201d Another ongoing issue that has gained traction this election cycle is the pay gap. Regardless of personal beliefs about the need for the ERA, the Belmont-Paul staff emphasizes education on the issue. \u201cSome people believe that women are already guaranteed equal rights in the Constitution, based on the 14th Amendment,\u201d Krafchik said, explaining a common misconception. \u201cWhether you support the ERA or don\u2019t support the ERA, understanding where we\u2019ve come from, where we still have to go and the rights that we\u2019re still fighting for is an important message for us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Clinton tops Trump 52% to 43% in a head-to-head matchup In a four-way race: Clinton 45%, Trump 37%, Johnson 9% and Stein 5% Hillary Clinton emerges from her party\u2019s convention in Philadelphia with a restored lead over Donald Trump, having earned a 7-point convention bounce, according to a new CNN/ORC Poll. In a two-way head-to-head matchup, Clinton tops Trump 52% to 43%, and in a four-way matchup including third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, Clinton leads 45% to 37% with Johnson at 9% and Stein at 5%. Besides improving her standing against Trump, Clinton\u2019s convention appears to have boosted the share of Americans who think her policies will move the country in the right direction (from 43% before either convention to 48% now), while Trump\u2019s right direction number held roughly steady following the back-to-back political gatherings in Cleveland and Philadelphia. Further, a majority of Clinton\u2019s backers now say their vote is more to show support for her than to oppose Trump, a sharp shift since early May. Back then, 48% said their vote was one of support for the former secretary of state, 58% say so now. While Trump also improved his numbers on that metric, his voters are more evenly divided, with 47% saying they\u2019re backing him to show support and 50% saying it\u2019s more to oppose Clinton. John McCain criticizes Trump's feud with Muslim family READ: The complete CNN/ORC poll results More of Clinton\u2019s backers also say they are certain to support her come November: 44% of registered voters are Clinton supporters who say their mind is made up, while 36% say they are solidly behind Trump. Only about 16% of voters say their minds could change in the 99 days left between now and Election Day. Clinton\u2019s convention appears to have helped her reverse the damage done to perceptions of her honesty during the GOP convention, but she did not improve those numbers compared with where they stood before either convention. Overall, 34% say they consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, up from 30% after the GOP convention but exactly where that figure was in a poll conducted before either convention happened. Clinton made more progress on several other measures, however, with 50% now saying she\u2019s in touch with the problems of ordinary Americans, and 48% that she will unite the country and not divide it. She gained three points \u2013 a change inside the margin of sampling error for this poll \u2013 compared with a poll conducted before the Republican convention on having the right experience, running for the good of the country rather than personal gain and as someone you would be proud to have as president. On each of those measures, Clinton fares better than Trump, except when voters are asked about their honesty. Thirty-five percent say they see Trump as honest and trustworthy, just about even with the former secretary of state. Gold Star mother responds to Donald Trump Kaine breaks with Clinton on abortion provision On the rest of the attributes tested, the Democratic convention appears to have wiped out the significant gains Trump made on several of these measures, including being seen as in-touch with ordinary Americans, someone you\u2019d be proud to have as president, running for the good of the country rather than personal gain and uniting the country rather than dividing it. Nearly half of registered voters say what they saw or read of the Democratic convention left them feeling more likely to vote Clinton vs. 39% who said it turned them off from supporting her. Trump\u2019s convention merited a slight negative tilt on this question, according to a CNN/ORC Poll released last week, with 42% saying they would be more apt to back him vs. 44% less likely. The 49% saying the DNC made them feel more apt to vote for Clinton is the fourth highest in CNN/ORC and Gallup polling, dating back to the 1984 Democratic convention. It\u2019s behind the 60% who said they were more apt to back Bill Clinton after the 1992 Democratic convention, 56% more likely to back Michael Dukakis after his 1988 convention and 51% who said they would be more likely to vote for Barack Obama after the \u201908 Democratic convention. Top Jeb Bush adviser leaves GOP Clinton\u2019s acceptance speech merited mixed reviews, with 44% calling it excellent or good, 20% just OK and 19% poor or terrible. Last week, a CNN/ORC survey found 40% calling Trump\u2019s speech excellent or good. Clinton\u2019s speech ranks well behind other recent Democratic acceptance speeches, 64% called Obama\u2019s \u201908 address excellent or good, and 52% each called John Kerry\u2019s 2004 speech and Al Gore\u2019s 2000 speech excellent or good. In the new poll, there is a wide gender gap in reviews of Clinton\u2019s acceptance speech, with 50% of women calling Clinton\u2019s speech excellent or good compared with 37% of men. There was no gender gap in perceptions of Trump\u2019s speech. This gap isn\u2019t merely a partisan divide, it exists within each party as well, and most notably at the extremes. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, 42% of women called her speech excellent vs. just 25% of men. And among Republican and Republican-leaning men, 28% called Clinton\u2019s speech terrible, vs. just 18% of Republican and Republican-leaning women. On the convention\u2019s tone, 49% said the Democrats spent too much time criticizing the Republicans, well below the 58% who said the GOP convention was too critical. Clinton\u2019s convention, despite regular interruption from dissatisfied Bernie Sanders delegates inside the convention hall, also appears to have bolstered Democratic unity overall and strengthened her position among Sanders\u2019 supporters. Among Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, 84% now feel the party will be united by November, up from 75% before either convention. Those who say they would rather have seen the party nominate Sanders now split 69% for Clinton, 13% for Stein, 10% for Johnson and just 3% say they\u2019ll back Trump. That\u2019s a 5-point improvement for Clinton (inside the margin of sampling error for this subgroup), an 8-point dropoff in the share who say they\u2019d back Trump and a 7-point increase in support for Jill Stein. Khizr Khan: Donald Trump needs to listen to America Did Trump go too far? Republican Party unity, meanwhile, has faded some compared with a survey immediately after their convention. While 73% said they thought the GOP would unite by November in a post-GOP convention poll, just 66% say the same now. Both conventions featured their candidate\u2019s family members prominently, but Americans aren\u2019t so sure they should have that much of a role in any administration. Two-thirds (66%) said Trump\u2019s children should not have a role on policy matters if Trump wins the election, and 57% said Bill and Chelsea Clinton should not be working on policy matters should Hillary Clinton win the presidency. Clinton\u2019s favorability rating has rebounded from the small hit it took following Trump\u2019s convention (her favorability among registered voters dipped slightly from 43% before the Republican convention to 41% after and now stands at 43% again), but both shifts were small enough to be within the margin of sampling error. Trump\u2019s rating among registered voters did take a hit, from a 39% favorable and 59% unfavorable reading before either convention to a 35% favorable to 61% unfavorable read now. Tim Kaine\u2019s favorability rating among registered voters rose from 31% before the Democratic convention to 39% after. That\u2019s a bit smaller than Mike Pence\u2019s increase after the Republican convention (his favorability rose from 26% before the GOP convention to 39% after), but those gains have faded some as just 29% of registered voters say they have a favorable opinion of Pence now. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone July 29-31 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults, including 894 registered voters. Results for the sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "The Rules Committee will help determine the fate of the anti-Trump movement at the Republican Convention Trump opponents face long odds Republican Party leaders, donors and important delegates will flock to Cleveland this week for a series of meetings and negotiations that will determine whether or not Donald Trump can be stopped. The anti-Trump forces will make their last stand \u2013 fighting to alter party rules that would free up delegates bound to Trump and potentially block the presumptive presidential nominee from actually winning the nomination. The long-shot challenge will also be the first major test for the somewhat tenuous alliance for Trump and Republican Party loyalists led by chairman Reince Priebus. GOP leaders will also hash out the party\u2019s platform. This year has seen Trump go against party orthodoxy on trade and abortion \u2013 a key question is how far he wants to go to change the platform, and how much of a fight Republican stalwarts will put up to maintain hard lines on certain social issues. Here\u2019s what to watch for in Cleveland this week: This will likely be the final chance for Trump opponents to stop the New York billionaire. They will try to convince a majority of the Rules Committee to adopt a proposal to allow delegates to vote their \u201cconscience\u201d and break from primary results supporting Trump. Trump quips about winning in November \u2013 and not serving as president Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh has led the effort to break delegates free from election results supporting Trump and supporters say they have raised millions of dollars to hire a team of delegate \u201cwhips\u201d who will fan out across the convention floor and ensure they have enough delegates supporting them. This week, Unruh and her allies will need the support of 57 members of the convention Rules Committee to vote for her version of the rules to make it the recommendation on the floor, or 28 to get what\u2019s called a minority report in front of the full convention. Either plan would then need to be adopted next week by the full convention. \u201cI don\u2019t think people should be scared of the notion that it\u2019s going to be chaos. It\u2019s not going to be chaos any more than the 1860 convention that nominated Lincoln,\u201d anti-Trump conservative Bill Kristol said on a conference call with Unruh\u2019s group last week. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual, but this is an unusual year with unusual circumstances.\u201d Draft GOP platform calls for \u2018America first\u2019 trade policy, drops call for marriage amendment Unruh and her team hosted one final conference call Sunday night. Perhaps as a reflection of the grass-roots nature of this latest effort, the call devolved into a cacophony of unmuted lines after about a half hour, as Unruh ended the formal portion of the call but activists and delegates aired out their many questions. Unruh said she expects a vote Friday on their proposal to release the delegates, the group is also pushing for voting in a vice presidential pick separate from Trump\u2019s \u2013 part of a broader package they\u2019re coining the \u201cConscience Agenda.\u201d Dane Waters, co-founder of Delegates Unbound, an affiliated group organizing a whip operation for the convention, dismissed skeptics in the Republican National Committee, Trump campaign and the press. \u201cYou never disclose the size of your army before you go into battle,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI have absolutely no doubt in my mind there are enough delegates supporting this that Donald Trump will not be the nominee on the first ballot.\u201d Trump clashes with GOP critic The group was bullish heading into the week\u2019s events. Jace Laquerre, a 17-year-old Republican delegate from Vermont, said on the call that the Trump campaign tried to unseat him through a credentials challenge but failed because they missed the party deadline. \u201cIn typical Trump campaign fashion, they were disorganized, they filed it a day late,\u201d Laquerre said. The flip side of the delegate insurrection question is whether the somewhat odd union of the Trump campaign and the Republican Party staff can squash the delegate uprising before it has a chance to draw the focus away from the coronation of Trump. The Rules Committee is stocked with long-time movers and shakers in the GOP, who fear that, regardless of Trump\u2019s controversial moments, any appearance of trying to undo the will of voters would tear the party apart. They\u2019ll use their influence to try to block any uprising, and they have the experience with these gatherings to move the party\u2019s machinery behind the scenes. RNC loyalist and Trump supporter Randy Evans sounded an alarm bell earlier in the week, saying that Trump supporters had only marshaled the support of 888 delegates to block any uprising \u2013 well short of the minimum 1,237 they would need should an anti-Trump option reach the floor next week. Pol: Trump defended articles of the Constitution that don\u2019t exist Rules Committee members Solomon Yue, of Oregon, and Bruce Ash, of Arizona, are looking to minimize any contention in the rules development process. Yue has sponsored an amendment before the GOP standing committee to prevent any rules changes from going into effect until after the convention\u2019s end, meaning any changes wouldn\u2019t impact the Trump nomination, and Ash has sponsored one that would solidify a part of the rules requiring a candidate win the majority of delegates in eight states to qualify for nomination. Trump has propelled his campaign by tapping into angst in blue collar America, and has heavily criticized free trade deals as taking away American livelihoods. His position is so different from the typical GOP line that during one of his economic speeches, reliable Republican backer and business lobby heavyweight the U.S. Chamber of Commerce tweeted point-by-point refutations of his policies. The 2012 GOP platform includes a traditionally Republican position on trade. \u201cInternational trade is crucial for our economy. It means more American jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living,\u201d it read. \u201cThe Free Trade Agreements negotiated with friendly democracies since President Reagan\u2019s trailblazing pact with Israel in 1985 facilitated the creation of nearly 10 million jobs supported by our exports.\u201d But Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, saying in a recent speech: \u201cOur politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization \u2013 moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. \u2026 Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy.\u201d Senate Republicans cash in on donors who aren\u2019t giving to Trump An early draft of the platform given to delegates on the committee to work off of Sunday night by the RNC largely borrowed Trump\u2019s language on putting \u201cAmerica first\u201d on trade but didn\u2019t push major sweeping policy changes. The Platform Committee consists of 112 delegates, two from each state and territory, and a subcommittee of that group will be tasked with writing the party\u2019s language on commerce and trade. Whether the platform looks more like Trump or more like the GOP\u2019s traditional position will be an important test case on how ready the party\u2019s elite is to embrace Trump\u2019s policies and his energized base. While trade is the clearest example of Trump\u2019s break from the party orthodoxy, there are plenty of areas of the platform where the presumptive nominee has gotten both to the left and the right of the 2012 GOP platform. On the issue of LGBT rights and abortion, Trump has seemingly broken away from planks that call for a constitutional amendment declaring marriage as between one man and one woman and a protection of human life plank that does not explicitly embrace exceptions such as life of the mother or rape or incest. Trump has said he would be open to such exceptions, and made comments about being a candidate protective of LGBT Americans. He has not spoken in favor of amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Nevertheless, conservatives working to maintain the platform line on these issues say they have spoken with the Trump campaign and feel comfortable that Trump\u2019s surrogates will not try to substantially change the party position. The early draft did not make substantive changes to abortion language, however, but did adjust the language on marriage. While still calling for a \u201cmarried mom and dad\u201d in each family and decrying an activist court, the document abandoned a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage (in the platform since 2004) in favor of leaving the issue to the states. Fallin says she isn\u2019t being vetted for Trump VP The mogul has also made some comments about gun control that have left his position murky. While he calls himself a proud defender of the Second Amendment, he has also expressed openness to barring suspected terrorists from getting guns, saying he would discuss the idea with the National Rifle Association. That language was not in the draft platform, however. But there are also areas where Trump may pull the party to the right. On Israel, for example, Trump\u2019s advisers have signaled an openness to move away from language supporting a two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians, favoring instead a position of backing whatever the Israeli government policy is. Both parties have included support of a two-state solution in their party platforms for more than a decade, however, in an effort to reflect U.S. policy and keep Israel a seemingly nonpartisan issue. The draft added \u201cundivided\u201d to the call to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, taken out in 2012, and removes a reference to Palestine while leaving in a call for two Democratic states. The Republican National Committee \u2013 the very group that makes up the party \u2013 is nothing if not an insiders\u2019 club. Its 168 members, selected by small groups of party activists, who are rarely thrust into the national spotlight with quite the ardor of the 2016 cycle. In one sign of how much interest there is, the RNC was forced to set up separate media-watching rooms for rules and platform committee meetings. Priebus\u2019 team is aiming for quiet and smooth \u2013 two things that are rarely associated with Trump \u2013 but his band of loyal members, led by RNC general counsel John Ryder and others, are largely untouched by Trump, because Trump and his supporters were never a presence inside the small club until this year. Priebus, who oversaw an \u201cautopsy\u201d of the 2012 election after Mitt Romney\u2019s crippling loss, has been holding the party apparatus together. But one of the biggest questions remains what kind of stamp Trump will leave on the RNC, and whether there will be room for Priebus at the top after November.",

            "article_content": "Trump will meet with Hill Republicans Thursday at a morning session at the Capitol Hill Club For those who are going, there's a group that is still skeptical Donald Trump is coming to Capitol Hill to rally the GOP troops roughly two weeks before he\u2019s slated to accept his party\u2019s nomination for president at the GOP convention in Cleveland, but the crowd might be a little thin. \u201cI\u2019ve got a long-standing appointment downtown and I don\u2019t know at what time I can get out of that and get back to the Hill,\u201d Rep. Fred Upton, R-Michigan, told reporters Wednesday. Colorado GOP Rep. Mike Coffman, one of the House Democrats\u2019 top targets in November, told CNN, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to make it. I\u2019ve got a conflict.\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, who is in a difficult re-election race in Pennsylvania and has not endorsed Trump, shrugged off questions about the meeting Trump has scheduled with at the National Republican Senatorial Committee Thursday. \u201cI haven\u2019t checked my schedule yet,\u201d Toomey said Wednesday evening when asked if he\u2019d attend the Trump session. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Asked if he felt the need to hear what his party\u2019s nominee had to say, Upton, who hasn\u2019t endorsed Trump and isn\u2019t planning to attend the convention, said about his own meeting, \u201cThis has been set up for some time.\u201d For those who are going, there\u2019s a group that is still skeptical, but hopeful they will learn something new, especially since the vast majority of Hill Republicans haven\u2019t met Trump personally yet. Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger has publicly criticized Trump but has left open the possibility he could eventually back him and told CNN he\u2019s going to the meeting. \u201cFor me, I\u2019ve always said I want to get there. I\u2019m not there, so if he\u2019s going to come talk to us, I\u2019m happy to hear what he has to say,\u201d Kinzinger said. But the Iraq war veteran said that Trump\u2019s comments praising Saddam Hussein at a rally in North Carolina are making it harder for him to come around to his candidacy. \u201cIt was ludicrous,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a deep concern that he has a fundamental lack of knowledge about foreign policy and the president has almost unchecked power on foreign policy.\u201d Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, one of Trump\u2019s earliest supporters in Congress, downplayed those who decided against attending the morning session at the Capitol Hill Club hosted by House GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington. \u201cIf they are skipping it, they are skipping it \u2013 they\u2019ve got stuff to do,\u201d Hunter said. After weeks of infighting within their party and lingering fears about Trump\u2019s candidacy, some clearly hope that Trump\u2019s Thursday meeting will give the party a chance to unite. And Republicans say one thing has helped in that regard \u2013 the common desire to beat Clinton, something many believe is quite possible after her handling of classified intelligence was sharply criticized by the FBI. Rep. Raul Labrador, an Idaho conservative who has been critical of Trump, said he was more concerned about beating Hillary Clinton than he was worried about Trump. \u201cWe have a very beatable candidate in Hillary Clinton,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cWhen he calls her \u2018Crooked Hillary,\u2019 the FBI just said that it was true. \u2026 So I think we need to make sure that he continues to prosecute the case against Hillary, and I think he can win.\u201d Still, Republican leaders are uneasy with Trump. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is among the California delegates for Trump at the convention, declined to say if he\u2019s now more comfortable with Trump as the nominee. \u201cI always look to constant improvement,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not say if Trump should receive classified briefings \u2013 even as Republican leaders say Clinton should now be denied access to highly sensitive intelligence. \u201cThe question here is Hillary Clinton,\u201d McConnell said when asked about Trump, \u201cand her public explanations compared to her private representations to the FBI.\u201d Hunter said Trump \u201cneeds to be himself\u201d at the meeting and said he believes the chance to talk with members will help the business mogul expand support among those who haven\u2019t yet embraced his candidacy. But when asked about his colleagues worried about what Trump\u2019s comments about Hussein, Hunter, who served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he didn\u2019t see the comments, so couldn\u2019t speak to the context and added, \u201cI\u2019m not a surrogate, I\u2019m not going to answer for him.\u201d Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Charlie Dent said he remains concerned about some of the controversial statements the businessman has made \u201cdealing with issues like POWs, the disabled, to Mexicans, to Muslims, to women, to the David Duke debacle, to the Chris Matthews exchange on abortion, to the Indiana judge, to yesterday and Saddam Hussein.\u201d Initially, Dent told reporters he planned to go, but after a few minutes appeared to be on the fence, saying, \u201cI intend to go, but I could change my mind between now and then.\u201d",

            "article_content": "This is the post-primary Never Trump movement in action National opinion polls show Clinton leading Trump among several demographic groups, notably women voters Huddled around a corner table during happy hour at the swanky St. Regis Hotel bar in downtown Washington, five young Republicans busily brainstormed how they could help Hillary Clinton become the next president of the United States. The group included an unlikely gang of pro-Clinton foot soldiers, including a Mississippi-born Southern Baptist who got her start in GOP politics as an intern in the second Bush White House, a conservative health care policy analyst who has volunteered for anti-abortion causes and a former president of the Cornell University College Republicans. Over glasses of wine and champagne Monday night, they kicked off the first steering committee meeting for a new organization: \u201cRepublican Women for Hillary.\u201d Their motivation? Stop Donald Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that Republican leaders, especially Republican women leaders, stand up right now and say we\u2019re not OK with Trump representing our party,\u201d said Jennifer Lim, a group founder who works at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and has spent much of her life volunteering for Republican causes and campaigns. \u201cThis is not a position I ever wanted to find myself in. But it\u2019s important that when things like this happen that people speak up.\u201d Lim\u2019s role as a leader within the new group is independent of her day job. But earlier this week, the Chamber clashed with Trump over his embrace of protectionist trade policies, which the business group opposes. Over the next several months, members of Republican Women for Hillary plan to provide cover for Republicans looking to speak out against Trump, whose surprising rise has torn the party apart. Faced with a choice between Clinton and Trump, some Republicans have begrudgingly agreed to support him while others are simply opting out of the election. But for these women who founded the group, (and one man who has joined in solidarity), Trump\u2019s bombastic style, offensive rhetoric toward women and minorities, slapdash policy \u201csuggestions\u201d risk destroying the party. This is the post-primary Never Trump movement in action. Their new organization, which is not affiliated with the Clinton campaign, is part support group and part activist hub: They intend to host off-the-record social events for like-minded conservatives and sponsor get-out-the-vote efforts for Clinton. They started in May by launching accounts on Facebook and Twitter and are planning to make an appearance at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia next month. We're with her! #GOPwithHer #ImWithHer https://t.co/FhKIaa6BX5 Making the switch to openly support a Clinton for president wasn\u2019t a decision they came to lightly, the group\u2019s members said. \u201cIt has been tough for me to come to this point where I can vote for a candidate who has been very against what I\u2019ve been working for for most of my professional career,\u201d said Meghan Milloy, who works for the conservative American Action Forum think tank and has formerly campaigned for Republicans like Trent Lott, Mitt Romney and Haley Barbour. \u201cThat being said, I can\u2019t vote for someone like Donald Trump because he\u2019s overtly racist and misogynist.\u201d Lim said she intends to knock on doors, make phone calls for Clinton and will donate to the Democratic campaign, a step she has never taken in her life. Her temporary transition to Democratic volunteer might seem all too convenient at first: She was recently married to Tim Lim, the founder of a media buying firm called Precision and a partner at Bully Pulpit Interactive, which has a contract with the Clinton campaign. But, she said, her reasons for supporting Clinton are genuine and purely strategic. Her current activism is about stopping Trump from winning the general election, preserving the the Republican Party and the conservative values it promotes, she said. \u201cOur group isn\u2019t about selling Clinton. It\u2019s about using your vote to keep Trump out of office,\u201d Lim said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be in the business of convincing people that Hillary Clinton will be the savior of all of our policy issues. We\u2019re trying to convince people that your vote has a political and moral purpose, and it\u2019s important to use that.\u201d \u201cThis was a long road for me to get here,\u201d she added. It is Republican women like these that Clinton has made a concerted effort to reach during as part of her campaign. Are you a Republican who thinks @realDonaldTrump should not become president?Tell us why: https://t.co/OvwepPNXoC Recent data suggest that it\u2019s working. National opinion polls show Clinton leading Trump among several demographic groups, notably women voters. Meanwhile, an ABC News/Washington Post survey conducted in June found that 77 percent of women have an unfavorable view of Trump. As for policy, there are only a few areas where the group\u2019s leaders said they could agree with Clinton, which mostly involves foreign policy and trade. More importantly, however, they see her as a reasonable person\u2014especially compared with the unpredictable Trump\u2014and someone Republicans could possibly work with. \u201cWe can put our differences aside to have a safer option that\u2019s better for the country as a whole,\u201d Milloy said. \u201cThe fear of Donald Trump is, to me, more than the fear of Hillary raising capital standards on banks.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ruling is 5-3; Justice Anthony Kennedy was the swing vote Will have major impact on efforts to limit abortion rights In a dramatic ruling, the Supreme Court on Monday threw out a Texas abortion access law in a victory to supporters of abortion rights who argued it would have shuttered all but a handful of clinics in the state. The 5-3 ruling is the most significant decision from the Supreme Court on abortion in two decades and could serve to deter other states from passing so-called \u201cclinic shutdown\u201d laws. In joining with the liberal justices, perennial swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy helped deliver a victory to abortion rights activists and signaled the court\u2019s majority in their favor could continue regardless of the presidential election and the filling of the empty seat on the bench left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Supreme Court issues in 2016 Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, which was joined in full by Kennedy. Breyer wrote that despite arguments that the restrictions were designed to protect women\u2019s health, the reality is that they merely amounted to burdening women who seek abortions. \u201cThere was no significant health-related problem that the new law helped to cure,\u201d Breyer wrote. \u201cWe agree with the District Court that the surgical-center requirement, like the admitting-privileges requirement, provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a  substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an \u201cundue burden\u201d on their constitutional right to do so.\u201d Abortion in America: More complex than you think Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Breyer\u2019s opinion and wrote a brief concurring opinion, which focused on what she called women in \u201cdesperate circumstances.\u201d \u201cWhen a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, faute de mieux, at great risk to their health and safety,\u201d she wrote. The ruling will have reverberations on the presidential election, where the fate of the Supreme Court has been front-and-center after the death of Scalia in February. Senate Republicans have refused to act on President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, leaving the court with eight justices. Supreme Court vacates former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s conviction But Monday\u2019s ruling signals that even if Republicans were to name that replacement, the court still has a five-justice majority that could rule against abortion restrictions. And if Hillary Clinton were to win, the majority could even grow. Hillary Clinton immediately praised the ruling. \u201cSCOTUS\u2019s decision is a victory for women in Texas and across America. Safe abortion should be a right\u2014not just on paper, but in reality. -H\u201d SCOTUS's decision is a victory for women in Texas and across America. Safe abortion should be a right\u2014not just on paper, but in reality. -H President Barack Obama said he is \u201cpleased\u201d by the ruling. \u201cWe remain strongly committed to the protection of women\u2019s health, including protecting a woman\u2019s access to safe, affordable health care and her right to determine her own future, the President said. How Ruth Bader Ginsburg steered the court on Texas\u2019 abortion law The court\u2019s decision has major implications for the future political battles over abortion beyond Texas. Anti-abortion activists since Roe v. Wade have worked to pass a slew of laws across the country restricting abortions or making them more difficult, like the law struck down in Texas. But Monday\u2019s ruling strengthened the premise of the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v Casey, sending a message to states that might pass such laws and lower courts that would uphold them that they have a high hurdle to prove they\u2019re constitutional. The Casey ruling said that states could impose restrictions as long as they didn\u2019t impose an undue burden on the woman. \u201cBy clarifying exactly what the \u2018undue burden\u2019 test requires, I suspect the majority was hoping to dissuade states like Oklahoma from continuing to pass laws that so directly challenge the central premise of Roe v. Wade \u2013 that the Constitution protects a pregnant woman\u2019s right to an abortion in a meaningful percentage of cases,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN contributor and professor of law at American University Washington College of Law. \u201cIn the process, the Court today has called into question everything from categorical bans on abortions to so-called \u2018fetal heartbeat\u2019 restrictions, and perhaps plenty of other laws in between,\u201d Vladeck added. Supreme Court sides against Maine man in gun ownership case Already, both sides signaled they intend to keep fighting. \u201cOur fight is far from over,\u201d Clinton said in a statement. \u201cIn Texas and across the country, a woman\u2019s constitutional right to make her own health decisions is under attack. In the first three months of 2016, states introduced more than 400 measures restricting access to abortion.\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott decried the ruling. \u201cThe decision erodes States\u2019 lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women and subjects more innocent life to being lost,\u201d the Republican governor said in a statement. \u201cTexas\u2019 goal is to protect innocent life, while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the Court\u2019s decision. But our fight to protect women\u2019s health & promote life will not stop here,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted. I'm disappointed in the Court\u2019s decision. But our fight to protect women\u2019s health & promote life will not stop here. pic.twitter.com/sG0TyuT521 All eyes were on Kennedy entering oral arguments \u2013 a position the 79-year-old justice has often found himself in on the abortion issue. Kennedy was one of the authors of Casey, but then disappointed supporters of abortion rights when he upheld the federal partial birth abortion ban in 2007. All eyes were on him for this case to see if he would take the opportunity to clarify Casey. Instead, as the most senior justice in the majority it was his choice to allow Breyer to write. History of Texas' abortion fight Abortion at the Supreme Court; all eyes on Kennedy \u201cThe fact that Justice Kennedy gave away this opinion assignment and didn\u2019t write separately is striking,\u201d said Vladeck. \u201cKennedy has not only been the swing vote on abortion issues since he joined the Court in 1988, but he has written an opinion in virtually every major abortion case during that time, including the majority opinion in the Court\u2019s controversial 2007 decision upholding the federal ban on so-called \u2018partial-birth\u2019 abortions. \u201cIt\u2019s not stunning that he sided with the liberals in striking down the Texas law in this case, but it is stunning that he didn\u2019t feel the need to explain why,\u201d Vladeck added. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito wrote dissents. Thomas wrote a bitter dissent for himself, accusing the court of eroding the Constitution. \u201cThe Court has simultaneously transformed judicially created rights like the right to abortion into preferred constitutional rights, while disfavoring many of the rights actually enumerated in the Constitution,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cBut our Constitution renounces the notion that some constitutional rights are more equal than others. \u2026 A law either infringes a constitutional right, or not; there is no room for the judiciary to invent tolerable degrees of encroachment. Unless the Court abides by one set of rules to adjudicate constitutional rights, it will continue reducing constitutional law to policy-driven value judgments until the last shreds of its legitimacy disappear.\u201d While Thomas would have upheld the laws, in Alito\u2019s dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, the justices would have sent the laws back to the lower courts to be decided after more evidence was presented. Alito accused the justices in the majority of fabricating claims for the attorneys in the case. \u201cDetermined to strike down two provisions of a new Texas abortion statute in all of their applications, the Court simply disregards basic rules that apply in all other cases,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cThe Court favors petitioners with a victory that they did not have the audacity to seek.\u201d Alito thought the two provisions of the law should have been dealt with separately and he condemns the majority for failing to do that analysis. \u201cIf some applications are unconstitutional,  the severability clause plainly requires that those applications be severed and that the rest be left intact\u2026.How can the Court possibly escape this painfully obvious conclusion. Its main argument is that it need not honor the severability provision because doing so would be too burdensome.\u201d Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network and former clerk to Thomas, said the ruling \u201cmade clear that some constitutional rights are more equal than others.\u201d In a statement, she added that \u201cby throwing out the regular legal rules in order to carry water for the abortion industry, the Court has further threatened its own legitimacy. It\u2019s no wonder the Supreme Court is suffering record levels of disapproval with the American people.\u201d There were two provisions of the law at issue. The first said that doctors have to have local admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, the second says that the clinics have to upgrade their facilities to hospital-like standards. Critics say if the 2013 law, known as H.B. 2, is allowed to go into effect it could shutter all but a handful of clinics in a state with 5.4 million women of reproductive age. Texas countered that the law was passed in response to the Kermit Gosnell scandal. The Pennsylvania man was convicted in 2013 of first-degree murder for killing babies that were born alive in his clinic. Abortion ruling reactions are strong, divided on the front lines in Texas State Solicitor General Scott Keller argued in court papers that if the court were to uphold the law, an abortion clinic \u201cwill remain open in each area where one will close, meaning that over 90% of Texas women of reproductive age will live within 150 miles of an open abortion clinic.\u201d A federal appeals court upheld the Texas law in 2015, and last spring a majority of the Supreme Court voted to stay that ruling pending appeal. The four conservative justices at the time: John Roberts, along with Thomas, Alito and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, publicly noted that they would have denied the stay. Protesters gathered outside the court in the hot, humid weather said they were ready to continue the abortion battle at the ballot box in November. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, told CNN that the electoral fight would extend from the race for the White House, to the races in statehouses throughout the nation. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wake-up call to most Americans who value freedom, who value dignity that we need to get out and make our voices heard against a vocal minority, especially in November,\u201d Hogue said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just at the top of the ticket, but at the statehouse, too.\u201d Teresa Stormes, 57, a CPA from Paragould, Arkansas, was visiting Washington with her children, Will Robbins, 18, and Ashley Robbins, 29. Even after a loss at the nation\u2019s highest court, people opposing abortion should turn to their local races and candidates, and their neighbors, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people on the planet and there\u2019s only a certain circle of people we can influence,\u201d Stormes said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you have to go back to square one and be an example where you are and support life where you are.\u201d Joe Aquilante, 42, a high school theology teacher from Philadelphia, said he had traveled down to Washington the previous weeks with other students and teachers from his school, expecting a ruling. When it was announced Monday, he said he had \u201cmixed emotions.\u201d \u201cYou know, I was saddened, but I\u2019m emboldened as well because we\u2019ve got to continue to fight,\u201d he said. Fiorella Spalvieri, 53, a mental health administrator who was visiting Washington and walked over to the protest in support of pro-abortion rights groups, took a sober view of the ruling Monday: \u201cI\u2019m not sure the debate will ever be over.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tom LoBianco contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump was addressing a small group of high-profile evangelicals Clinton she has had a number of public interactions with people where they discussed her faith Donald Trump argued Tuesday that the American public knows very little about Hillary Clinton\u2019s religion, raising questions about how it will impact her leadership should she become president. \u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about Hillary in terms of religion,\u201d he said, speaking to a group of Christian leaders in New York. \u201cNow, she\u2019s been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there\u2019s no \u2013 there\u2019s nothing out there. There\u2019s like nothing out there. It\u2019s going to be an extension of Obama but it\u2019s going to be worse, because with Obama you had your guard up. With Hillary you don\u2019t, and it\u2019s going to be worse.\u201d Trump was addressing a small group of high-profile evangelicals ahead of speaking before a larger group of religious leaders at a gathering hosted by the Christian group, United in Purpose. E.W. Jackson, who tweeted video of Trump\u2019s remarks, said the comment came while Trump was trying to say that conservatives tend to get questioned more about their faith than liberals. \u201cI think everybody in there knows Hillary Clinton is a Methodist and by definition a Christian,\u201d Jackson told CNN. \u201cHe was saying for those of us who are students of the Christian faith \u2013 for evangelicals that can mean everything is thoroughly examined, like what do you believe about marriage? What do you believe about abortion?\u201d Jackson, who ran as the 2013 Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in Virginia, said he was \u201caccused of believing all kinds of crazy things\u201d when he was a politician. \u201cAll (Trump) was saying was she hasn\u2019t had that same examination, so we don\u2019t really know what she believes,\u201d he added. Ken Blackwell, a Family Research Council fellow and Ohio politician, praised Trump\u2019s comments about \u201cprotecting religious liberty and speech, because I know this administration \u2013 and given that the Hillary administration will be a third term of Barack Obama, she would be a third term in her attack on religious liberty in general.\u201d \u201cI have no reason to attack her faith, I just question her ability to defend my right, my family\u2019s right, my church\u2019s right to practice our faith in the public square,\u201d Blackwell said. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said there\u2019s been \u201cvery little public conversation about (Clinton\u2019s) faith.\u201d \u201cI think it would be very helpful to hear what her faith is, what the core of her belief is,\u201d she said. The day after Trump\u2019s remarks, Clinton appealed to her Christian faith as the guiding source for her desire to help children. \u201cEvery single child deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. That has been the cause of my life. It\u2019s rooted in the values that I\u2019ve learned from my family and my faith,\u201d she said Wednesday in Raleigh. \u201cWe have responsibility to lift each other up,\u201d she added. \u201cAs we Methodists like to say, do all the good you can to all the people you can in all the ways you can.\u201d While it\u2019s true Clinton doesn\u2019t regularly talk about her faith, she has had a number of public interactions with people where they discussed her faith. RELATED: In personal exchange, Clinton laments using faith to \u2018judge so harshly\u2019 She also talked about her faith in an interview with CNN in January, saying, \u201cMy faith is a central part of who I am.\u201d \u201cWhat I believe, why I\u2019m called to service because I feel that I\u2019ve had a lot of blessings in my life and a lot of others are not so fortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful that I was both raised with a faith and that the faith has sustained me. I am very committed to what I believe is the discipline and the mandates that you should be responding to as a Christian and for me that has a lot to do with, you know, lifting up those who are the last, the lost and the least among us and trying to give more people a chance to chart a more positive for themselves. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always cared about and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as president.\u201d Trump has questioned other candidates\u2019 faith, as well. Of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump tweeted in February: \u201cHow can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?\u201d He also urged the group Tuesday to pray for his election. \u201cWhat you really have to do is pray to get everybody out to vote, for one specific person,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t be \u2013 again \u2013 politically correct and say we pray for all of our leaders because all of your leaders are selling Christianity down the tube, selling Evangelicals down the tubes.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, Eric Bradner and Eugene Scott contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton used her first speech since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee on Friday to blast Donald Trump for comments has had made about women, questioning whether women want to put \u201cour health, our lives, our futures in Donald Trump\u2019s hands.\u201d Clinton, who has now fully pivoted to the general election, delivered a point-by-point critique of Trump for comments he had made about women, arguing that \u201canyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood and wipe out safe legal abortion has no idea what is best for women.\u201d \u201cThis is a man who called women pigs, dogs and disgusting animals. Kind of hard counting on him to respect our fundamental right,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe says pregnant women are an inconvenience to their employer. What does that say about he values women, our work and our contributions?\u201d Trump has called actress Rosie O\u2019Donnell a \u201cfat pig\u201d on numerous occasions and referred to singer Bette Midler as \u201cdisgusting\u201d on Twitter. Trump also told NBC in 2004 that pregnancy is \u201ca wonderful thing for the woman, it\u2019s a wonderful thing for the husband, it\u2019s certainly an inconvenience for a business.\u201d Clinton\u2019s speech, aides said, was meant to send a clear signal to women \u2013 a crucial voting bloc \u2013 about what \u201ca Trump presidency would mean for women.\u201d Aides also said the fact Clinton went to Planned Parenthood for her first speech after clinching the nomination was meant to be a signal to liberals that she is not going to move to the center, despite clinching the nomination. Clinton said on Friday that \u201cwhen Donald Trump says let\u2019s make America great again, that is code for, let\u2019s take America backward back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved or some, not all.\u201d \u201cWell, Donald, those days are over,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe are not going to let Donald Trump or anyone else turn back the clock.\u201d Clinton noted that Trump \u2013 who has repeatedly praised Planned Parenthood \u2013 has also argued there should be punishment for women seeking abortions, the aide added, criticizing him for telling Fox News that the best way to ban abortion \u201cis by electing me president.\u201d Clinton is closing out a key week for her presidential campaign. After winning the California and New Jersey primaries, Clinton delivered a speech in Brooklyn where she claimed victory in the Democratic Primary. A trio of critical Democrats \u2013 President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2013 endorsed Clinton on Thursday. Clinton and Warren met at the former secretary of state\u2019s Washington, D.C., home on Friday. \u201cWe reached a milestone together this week thanks to you and people all of our country for the first time a woman will be a major party\u2019s nominee for president,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYesterday, I had the great honor of being endorsed by President Obama and Vice President Biden. And by senator Elizabeth Warren.\u201d She added, \u201cSo it has been a big week and there is nowhere I would rather end if than with the Planned Parenthood Acton Fund.\u201d",

The author works at the institute. Katie Couric says she would have handled Trump interviews differently She thinks the media should not have let him do so many phone-in interviews Katie Couric says TV news operations were instrumental in \u201cenabling\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy by affording him extraordinary airtime and allowing him to play by his own rules. \u201cThere was that period of time where it was wall to wall coverage, 90 minutes of his rallies, with very little editorial context. And I thought it was very difficult to ask him challenging questions on the phone because he was like a bulldozer,\u201d said Couric, global anchor for Yahoo News, told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d a podcast produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. Couric, a former \u201cToday\u201d show host who went on to anchor the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d and then host her own talk show, said she would have \u201cfought\u201d against doing any phone interviews with Trump. \u201cIf I had (done one), I would have said, \u2018You get five minutes and so does every other candidate,\u2019 because there just seemed to be something patently unfair. He knew how to work the system and the system was more than happy to have him work it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know because I wasn\u2019t in those booking meetings so maybe other candidates were saying no, but they shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d Instead, she argued that news outlets seemed to back down from Trump \u201ceither because of his railroading or because there was a lack of willingness to ask really tough questions for fear of cutting off access.\u201d At the same time, Couric noted that there has been \u201ca huge groundswell\u201d behind Trump, one that she wishes the media would spend more time covering. \u201cOne of the things that wasn\u2019t done as well was really examining the forces at work that were making him rise to the top and making his candidacy much more viable than people predicted,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think if we\u2019d spend a little more time every election (focusing on) less horserace and more context, more depth, more information, and more issues.\u201d Couric\u2019s concerns reflect widespread criticisms about media coverage of Trump\u2019s candidacy. But several interviews in which Trump was subjected to aggressive questioning elicited answers that quickly created headaches for his campaign. In a late February interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Trump wouldn\u2019t respond directly to a question on whether he would disavow support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and other white supremacist groups backing him. A month later MSNBC host Chris Matthews questioned Trump persistently on abortion. After a series of back-and-forths Trump said \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women who undergo illegal abortions \u2013 remarks that drew criticism across the political spectrum. In both cases Trump and his supporters quickly engaged in rounds of furious walk-backs to explain his remarks.

            "article_content": "\"It makes it harder to unite,\" said Rep. Raul Labrador House Republicans met with Ryan Wednesday morning Rank-and-file House Republicans are urging Speaker Paul Ryan to get behind presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, warning his resistance could lead to the party fracturing rather than uniting if he withholds his endorsement. \u201cIt makes it harder to unite,\u201d said Rep. Raul Labrador, an Idaho Republican and leader within the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Nevada Rep. Mark Amodei was incredulous about the speaker\u2019s high profile break with Trump last week, saying, \u201cRyan goes out on CNN and says it\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s duty to unite the party,\u201d asking, \u201cSo Mr. Speaker, what\u2019s your job regarding unity?\u201d House Republicans met with Ryan Wednesday morning for the first time since the speaker told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper he was not yet ready to endorse the presumptive nominee. READ: Paul Ryan: \u2018I\u2019m just not ready\u2019 to back Donald Trump After the meeting, Ryan waved off concerns he was making things tougher, saying, \u201cTo pretend we are unified without actually unifying means we go into the fall at half-strength. This election is too important to go into an election at half-strength.\u201d Many House GOP members shared some of Ryan\u2019s concerns about the controversial billionaire, but after his lengthy string of convincing primary victories, they are resigned to lining up behind Trump. But among conservatives there are still reservations, especially about the evolving positions the GOP nominee has taken on a broad range of issues. At Wednesday\u2019s closed-door meeting, several members urged Ryan to raise policy priorities they have championed when he sits down with Trump on Thursday. Specifically, they want Ryan to press Trump about his positions on abortion, budget and spending issues, and reforms to Medicare and Social Security. Other Republicans urged Ryan to caution the presumptive nominee that if he makes more controversial statements, like suggesting riots would occur if he were denied the GOP nomination, it will make those running on the same ticket as Trump in November uncomfortable to link themselves to their nominee. North Carolina GOP Rep. Walter Jones said after the meeting, \u201cMr. Trump has different positions and they change every so often, so we try to figure out where we\u2019re going.\u201d He defended Ryan taking some time to work through his position, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other choice than what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Despite lawmakers\u2019 deep concerns about Trump, many said they were backing him because Democrat Hillary Clinton would be worse in the White House. \u201cEven if Donald Trump brings chaos to this party, that\u2019s better than Hillary Clinton bringing destruction to this Constitution,\u201d Arizona GOP Rep. Trent Franks said. Some were willing to let the process with Ryan and Trump play out. \u201cThis looks to me like one of those political dances that ends up OK in the end. But you do have to go through the dance, and there\u2019s always a chance for a misstep,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and close ally of Ryan. The next step in that dance, he said, would be Trump meeting with the entire House Republican Conference, something lawmakers pitched to Ryan during their Wednesday meeting. Ben Carson, acting as an emissary for Trump, spoke to Ryan on Tuesday. Armstrong Williams, Carson\u2019s business manager, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday the call was meant to assure Ryan that \u201cDonald Trump is a reasonable man.\u201d Williams said he didn\u2019t expect the Thursday meeting to yield an endorsement, but did suggest that Trump and his associates were sympathetic to Ryan\u2019s concerns. \u201cYou can\u2019t take offense at the speaker being candid, just like Mr. Trump speaks candid,\u201d Williams said on \u201cWolf.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta respect that. So what the speaker was saying is, \u2018Listen, we\u2019ve got a down-ticket. There are people who are nervous about the kinds of things Mr. Trump has said in the past.\u2019\u201d Williams added: \u201cMen are meeting. Both with very critical roles in this country. They should sit down and talk like men. Unify their party. Show respect.\u201d Many lawmakers have also said they want to hear more from Trump about how he would promote conservative principles and where specifically he stands on issues. Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker Members of the House Freedom Caucus, who many credit with pressuring former House Speaker John Boehner into retirement, said they want assurances from Trump he will support conservative ideals. Top leaders in the House Freedom Caucus have requested their own meeting to discuss these issues with Trump directly. Rep. David Brat, a Virginia Republican and Freedom Caucus member, said that Ryan and Trump should sit down Thursday and work up a new \u201cContract with America\u201d \u2013 a nod to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s 1994 plan \u2013 and present it as a unified plan from the Republican Party. Louisiana GOP Rep. John Fleming, who told reporters he\u2019s backing Trump, said the process for his colleagues could take months and stretch out through July when Trump will get the formal Republican nomination. But he warned, \u201cI really think everything has to be resolved by the end of the convention.\u201d Rep. Chris Collins, the first House Republican to endorse Trump, downplayed others\u2019 criticisms of the speaker, saying he and others who are still not backing the nominee thought the race would last longer and need time, but he told reporters, \u201cwe\u2019ll be there.\u201d Fleming also said he believes Ryan and Trump will work out their differences, saying about the billionaire turned politician, \u201che\u2019s a dealmaker \u2013 he wants to find a resolution.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "At least five GOP senate candidates considered vulnerable are impacted by a Donald Trump presidential nomination Democrats are tying GOP Senate candidates to the presumptive Republican nominee Democrats got the Republican presidential nominee they hoped for this week as they work to take back control of the Senate. As soon as Donald Trump gained the presumptive nominee title \u2013 following his Indiana primary win Tuesday \u2013 Democrats swiftly moved to tie the GOP standard-bearer to vulnerable Republican Senate candidates. Many had kept a distance from the billionaire businessman even as they acknowledged they would eventually support whoever wins the GOP nomination. \u201cThis is no longer a drill,\u201d said a series of press releases from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington aimed at eight Republican senate candidates that argued GOP inaction on Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court meant the unpredictable Trump could be the one to fill that vacancy. One of those targeted was Sen. Kelly Ayotte New Hampshire who is in a tight re-election battle against the Democratic governor of that swing state, Maggie Hassan. \u201cAyotte would let the man who wants to ban Muslims from entering the country, called Mexican immigrants \u2018rapists\u2019 and said women should be punished for having an abortion nominate someone to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court,\u201d the DSCC statement said. Moments after Trump won Tuesday \u2013 and his chief opponent Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas dropped out of the GOP primary race \u2013 Hassan issued a statement calling on Ayotte \u201cto make her support for Trump official\u201d because they \u201cclearly are in agreement\u201d on many key issues. Liz Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Ayotte, told the New Hampshire Union Leader that the senator would support Trump but not officially endorse him, the distinction between the two not being clear. \u201cAs she\u2019s said from the beginning, Kelly plans to support the nominee. As a candidate herself, she hasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t planning to endorse anyone this cycle,\u201d Johnson said. Johnson did not respond to a request for clarification from CNN. Ayotte is one of five GOP senate candidates considered vulnerable, in part, because they are running in states President Barack Obama won in 2012 and 2008. If Democrats can win four of those seats, they will win back control of the Senate, which they lost two years ago. Making matters even tougher for Republicans is that they have to defend 24 seats \u2013 as many as 12 of which Democrats consider possible takeovers \u2013 while Democrats have to protect just 10, most of which are considered safe. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said the Trump attacks are a sign that Democrats aren\u2019t laying out their vision for the future, and also said Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton could pose a similar problem. \u201cThere is a reason Democrats aren\u2019t lining up to campaign with Hillary Clinton,\u201d NRSC spokeswoman Alleigh Marre said in a statement. \u201cShe is a toxic candidate whose failed leadership has put the security of our country at risk.\u201d Both parties believe control of the Senate over the next two years is crucial. Republicans see it as a firewall against the liberal policies and nominees of Hillary Clinton if she wins the White House and Democrats see it as a critical defense against the uncertain actions of Trump if he wins. One of those endangered Republicans, Rob Portman of Ohio, has said for months he would support whoever is the GOP nominee. A spokesman for his Democratic opponent, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, described Trump\u2019s rise as Portman\u2019s \u201celection nightmare.\u201d \u201cTrump at the top of the ticket will alienate the independent voters who decide elections in Ohio \u2013 while turning off moderate Republicans and energizing Democrats across the state. With the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, there will be no rock that Portman can hide under to avoid his Party\u2019s toxic nominee,\u201d said the statement from David Bergstein. Portman had backed Gov. John Kasich\u2019s bid for the GOP presidential nomination, who ended his campaign Wednesday. In a statement Portman praised Kasich but remained silent on Trump. RELATED: John Kasich drops out of presidential race Complicating matters for Portman further is word that Trump is considering Portman as a vice presidential pick, a campaign source told CNN. But Portman\u2019s spokesman Kevin Smith said he wasn\u2019t interested and was focused on his Senate re-election. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party targeted Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is seeking his second term in what is expected to be a close race against Democrat Katie McGinty, with a series of questions aimed to tying Toomey to Trump. \u201cDoes Toomey think Donald Trump is qualified to nominate the next Supreme Court justice?\u201d the statement asked.  \u201cHow does Toomey square his support of Trump with the presidential nominee\u2019s belief that \u2018wages are too high\u2019 in America?\u201d Toomey initially endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, for president. After Rubio dropped out, Toomey voted for Cruz in the Pennsylvania primary. But like so many Republican elected officials, even those wary of Trump, he has said he will also back whoever wins the nomination. In other races, Sen. John McCain\u2019s Democratic opponent argued in a fundraising appeal that the Arizona Republican is \u201cmore vulnerable than ever\u201d with Trump at the top of the ticket. \u201cDonate $5 to defeat John McCain,\u201d Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick wrote supporters of her campaign, which polls show is doing surprisingly well against McCain, who is seeking his sixth term. McCain, a former GOP presidential nominee himself, has repeatedly said he has concerns about many of Trump\u2019s policies but would nevertheless support him if he wins the GOP nod. But he told CNN he planned to skip the convention in Cleveland. A former longtime senior aide to McCain, Mark Salter, announced this week he would vote for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Trump. RELATED: Top McCain aide says he\u2019d back Clinton over Trump In Illinois, where Sen. Mark Kirk is considered one of the most endangered Republicans running, his Democratic opponent, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, highlighted an interview Kirk did with a local TV station in which he appears to say he would support Trump if he were the nominee. \u201cA Trump presidency is unthinkable to most Illinois voters, but not Mark Kirk,\u201d a Duckworth campaign spokesman said. Kirk\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. One vulnerable Republican is not keeping distance from Trump. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who is being challenged by Russ Feingold, a liberal former Democratic senator, told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju in late March that he would \u201cstump with Trump,\u201d even though the first term senator has not formally endorsed him. \u201cCertainly as I travel the state extensively I hear a lot of support because what Donald Trump is saying resonates with an awful lot of people when it comes to the incompetence of Washington D.C.,\u201d Johnson said.",

            "article_content": "Many Democrats are arguing that Kaine could help balance out a ticket with Hillary Clinton \"I'm not on any list that I know of,\" Kaine told CNN last week Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine is emerging as an early favorite to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate among major Democratic donors, operatives and congressional Democrats, who argue the Spanish-speaking former governor could be a steady hand in a difficult election environment. As the party establishment begins to shift its attention to a likely general election matchup against Donald Trump, many Democrats are now arguing that Kaine could help balance out the ticket by helping Clinton with independents in swing states and even expand the political map in the fall with his moderate profile, executive experience and foreign policy background. Road to 270: The electoral college map And as a politician from a southern state who has endured tough elections, proponents believe he can handle the grind of a high-profile presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight \u201cI would be 100% enthusiastic about Tim Kaine being our vice presidential candidate,\u201d said Peter Buttenwieser, a major Democratic donor and Clinton backer. \u201cNobody could be better.\u201d Sources: John Kasich to drop out How seriously Clinton is considering Kaine is far from certain. But Kaine has been atop Democratic running mate lists before, including in 2008 when Barack Obama\u2019s team was vetting the Virginia Democrat for the post before ultimately choosing Joe Biden. Senate Democratic leaders have not taken a position on Kaine as a running mate but would be supportive of his selection, sources said. In a brief interview last week in the Capitol, Kaine was coy when asked about his interest in the job. \u201cI\u2019m not on any list that I know of,\u201d he told CNN. Yet two Clinton confidants, who asked not to be named, said Kaine\u2019s name has been mentioned frequently as a possible running mate, but said it was too early to know how serious it was. Kaine, of course, has his drawbacks, too. He voted for fast-track trade authority last year \u2013 something bound to anger the populist, progressive wing of the party led by Sen. Bernie Sanders. He has a more nuanced position on abortion than many liberals. And as a white male, he hardly would be a historic pick the way other prospective vice presidential candidates are. At the starting gate: Clinton leads Trump by double-digits Moreover, as Clinton has struggled to excite the Democratic base, it\u2019s far from clear that Kaine \u2013 a mild-mannered and affable 58-year-old \u2013 would be able to do just that. Yet as a former chief executive of a swing state, along with his expertise serving on both the Foreign Relations and Armed Services panels, many believe his experience could make him the ideal running mate. Trump's 'woman card' remark leads to this ... \u201cIt\u2019s hard to construct a short list for vice president that he\u2019s not on,\u201d said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist and Clinton backer. \u201cHe has a business sense and international experience (and) speaks Spanish, which are both pluses,\u201d said Glen Fukushima, a Democratic donor who gave $100,000 to Clinton\u2019s super PAC last year. \u201cHe also has experience as a governor, which could complement Hillary\u2019s background.\u201d Bernie Sanders: \u2018We will continue to fight uphill\u2019 Other Democrats on Clinton\u2019s presumed list of potential picks would be far more historic than Kaine, including women such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, African-American pols like Sen. Cory Booker and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and two Latinos: Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Julian Castro, secretary of housing and urban development. Hillary Clinton apologizes for coal comments in West Virginia Two other senators are viewed as potential running mates, including Kaine\u2019s Virginia colleague, Mark Warner, and the progressive populist Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Brown told CNN last month that \u201cI don\u2019t really want\u201d to be vice president. What could help Kaine\u2019s case is that his state has a Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, ensuring that the balance of power in the Senate wouldn\u2019t be affected if he became VP since the governor could name an interim replacement. Moreover, as a former head of the Democratic National Committee, Kaine has amassed a network of donors important for a national campaign. Top McCain aide says he\u2019d back Clinton over Trump Some of Kaine\u2019s allies are pushing his name, including in Virginia. Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents a suburban Northern Virginia district outside Washington, told CNN that he is hearing from both voters and party activists about speculation on Kaine as a possible running mate. But he also said the same people are speaking highly of Warner, whom he also praised as a logical choice for Clinton. \u201cKaine has a lot going for him \u2013 he\u2019s Catholic, from a swing state, successful governor, speaks fluent Spanish, has political chops, was the head of the DNC,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cHe provides a lot of talent to the ticket and could step in and could certainly be an heir apparent.\u201d A Roman Catholic who taught at a Honduran mission during his law school years, Kaine is personally opposed to abortion but he is supportive of women\u2019s right to choose and opposes weakening laws permitting abortion. But Kaine\u2019s allies say he would be able to excite the base by tapping into concerns of income inequality, an issue of prime importance to the base. \u201cLow-income people, minorities, elderly, people that usually get the short of end of the stick would consider Tim Kaine a friend,\u201d said Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat who represents Richmond and has known Kaine since he started his political career.",

Huge wins for Clinton, Trump \u201cThe other day, Mr. Trump accused me, of playing the, quote, \u2018woman card,\u2019 \u201d Clinton said. \u201cWell, if fighting for women\u2019s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.\u201d Trump brought up the \u201cwomen\u2019s card\u201d again in his own victory speech Tuesday after his five-for-five showing in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Eye-rolling politician\u2019s wife upstages Trump \u201cI think the only card she has is the women\u2019s card,\u201d Trump said a short while later in New York. \u201cShe has got nothing else going. Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don\u2019t think she would get 5% of the vote. And the beautiful thing is, women don\u2019t like her.\u201d Trump continued the attack Wednesday on CNN. \u201cShe is a woman,\u201d he told Chris Cuomo on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cShe is playing the woman card left and right. She didn\u2019t play it last time with Obama. But she\u2019s playing it much harder this time and she will be called on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she were a man and she was the way she is, she would get virtually no votes.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s history of controversy with women He went on: \u201cHillary has a lot of flaws. She\u2019s got a lot of problems. A lot of women, as you know, don\u2019t like Hillary, despite the card.\u201d But exit polls don\u2019t bear that out. Clinton did well among women in Tuesday\u2019s primary states, according to exit polls of Democratic primary voters. She handily beat Bernie Sanders in the three states with exit poll data, garnering as much as 68% of female Democratic voters in Maryland. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Trump, Clinton score major victories Trump also captured the majority of women Republican primary voters in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, though by slightly smaller margins. Democrats are convinced that there will be a substantial gender gap favoring their candidate in the general election owing to Trump\u2019s past unflattering rhetoric on women and incidents like his recent comment \u2013 later walked back \u2013 that women who get an abortion should be punished. Caught your speech, @realDonaldTrump. About that \"woman's card\"...https://t.co/kKaHWISchy The contrast will be all the more acute because Clinton is trying to make history by becoming the first woman president and clearly sees her past role as an icon for women\u2019s rights and issues of gender equality as a huge advantage. Clinton\u2019s campaign also sent out a fundraising email Wednesday based on Trump\u2019s remarks, calling them an \u201cabsurd diatribe.\u201d But Trump\u2019s comment showed that he is ready for the fight, and thinks he can turn it to his advantage.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump won big, and Ted Cruz captured zero delegates Hillary Clinton got the major victory she had been seeking Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton came home to New York and both won big. Trump used his dominating victory as an opportunity to make his case that the only way he\u2019ll be denied the Republican nomination is if the game is rigged. Who's running for president? RNC chief dismisses Trump\u2019s comments as \u2018hyperbole\u2019 Clinton reveled in her win, which broke Bernie Sanders\u2019 string of successes in the West and Midwest. The victories pushed both candidates much closer to their parties\u2019 nominations, leaving their opponents no room for error if either is to be stopped. Here are five takeaways from New York\u2019s primary: New York truly is Trump territory. The Queens-born businessman put weeks of negative headlines \u2013 from staff changes to delegate losses to abortion flip-flops \u2013 behind him by crushing Ted Cruz and John Kasich in his home state. Exit polls also show New York Republicans believe Trump is the candidate with the best chance to defeat Clinton in the fall. Trump wins big in New York Abortion and 10 other Donald Trump flip-flops On stage at Trump Tower, the Republican front-runner surrounded himself with some of his high-profile business friends to cap what he called \u201can amazing week.\u201d And he set up the Republican contest as one that would have to be taken from him \u2013 unfairly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much of a race anymore, based on what I\u2019m seeing on television,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSenator Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated.\u201d Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton win big in New York Trump, facing a Cruz campaign adept at the inside baseball of delegate-counting, on Tuesday accused the Republican Party of trying to \u201ctake the election away\u201d from him.  He  touted the delegates he would capture in New York, emphasizing he won them in a primary election where voters went to the polls \u2013 an un-subtle dig at Cruz, who has done better in caucuses or party conventions. \u201cThe people aren\u2019t going to stand for it. It\u2019s a crooked system. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s rigged,\u201d Trump told the cheering crowd at Trump Tower. The good news for Trump shouldn\u2019t stop. April 26 \u2013 the next Super Tuesday \u2014 features Maryland, Pennsylvania and other northeastern states that should also be friendly to the front-runner. It\u2019s a sure sign that Clinton is expecting to celebrate when her campaign announces she\u2019ll deliver a speech on the night of a big election. \u201cThis one,\u201d Clinton told supporters,\u201d is personal.\u201d It\u2019s also a win that makes it much harder for Sanders to ever catch Clinton. In a nod to his supporters, whom Clinton would need if she wins the nomination, Clinton said at her victory party: \u201cTo all the people who supported Senator Sanders, I believe there is much more that unites us than divides us.\u201d Clinton wants to unite her party after New York win Poll: Sanders gains on Clinton, trails by 2 points Her commanding victory helped Clinton build on her pledged delegate lead, and it denied Sanders a win that could have changed the dynamics of the Democratic race. Now, Clinton needs to follow it up with more victories, instead of the speed bumps that have followed big wins in the past, such as Michigan after Super Tuesday. New York demonstrated once again why Sanders can\u2019t seem to catch up. Exit polls showed Clinton performed better than usual among voters ages 30-49 (though Sanders trounced her again with those 18-29), and kept her advantages among minorities, women and older voters. Sanders, meanwhile, still outperformed Clinton with younger voters, men and whites. Those advantages have been enough for Clinton so far \u2013 and they don\u2019t bode well for Sanders in states like New Jersey and California, where he\u2019d need to crush Clinton to have any chance of catching her in pledged delegates. Sanders hoped he\u2019d win New York. In fact, as a pro-Clinton group gleefully pointed out Tuesday, he\u2019d said at least 27 times that he expected to win. For two weeks he\u2019d practically moved back to his hometown of Brooklyn. But Sanders lost big. He congratulated Clinton for her win, but he also was quick to blame the system. New York\u2019s primary is closed \u2013 which means only registered Democrats can participate, limiting Sanders\u2019 ability to turn out the many independent voters who have helped him win other states. Opinion: Democrats are the real winners in New York The closed primary, Sanders said Tuesday evening in Pennsylvania as the crowd booed New York\u2019s laws, is \u201cwrong.\u201d \u201cThat has got to change in future elections,\u201d he said. Sanders, though, will face the same problem next Tuesday, when Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island vote. Of those five states, only Rhode Island allows independents to vote in the Democratic primary. Sanders slams Clinton camp, DNC for joint-fundraising Then there were the problems in Brooklyn \u2013 where Clinton has headquartered her campaign, but an area Sanders targeted. There, 126,000 voters were dropped from the registration list since last fall. His supporters were active on social media Tuesday pointing to both the closed primary and the Brooklyn woes as evidence the contest was unfair. The Sanders camp\u2019s eagerness to dismiss New York\u2019s results come as tensions flare between the two campaigns. Clinton\u2019s aides are furious with Sanders\u2019 allegations that she is violating campaign finance rules through her joint fundraising account with the Democratic National Committee \u2013 worried it will do long-term damage to the party\u2019s brand and play into Trump\u2019s casting of Clinton as \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d Sanders, meanwhile, unloaded on Clinton over paid speeches, Wall Street contributions and trade in a speech in Pennsylvania. Still, he hasn\u2019t addressed the fundamental weakness of his campaign: an inability to win black voters, CNN political commentator Van Jones notes. He pulled out all the stops in New York, leaning on former NAACP head Ben Jealous, releasing an ad by Spike Lee that featured Harry Belafonte, Rosario Dawson and Danny Glover, and leaning on alliances with the Working Families Party and the Transit Workers Union, both with strong black ties. If Sanders couldn\u2019t improve his performance with African-Americans in New York, it\u2019s not clear that he ever will. Turns out bashing \u201cNew York values\u201d isn\u2019t the way to make friends and influence people who vote in the New York primary. In Philadelphia on Tuesday night, Cruz spoke before New York\u2019s polls closed \u2014 sparing him, for the moment, the awkwardness of addressing his third-place finish and his zero delegate haul. New Yorkers on Ted Cruz and 'New York values' He didn\u2019t say anything about the contest at all, aside from noting that it\u2019s not surprising for a candidate (in this case, Trump) to win his home state. He\u2019d already campaigned in Maryland on Monday, and is fighting for conservatives in a district-by-district bid to deny Trump delegates. Everything Cruz did on Tuesday night \u2013 from the location of his event to the 8:30 p.m. ET timing \u2013 reinforced that he wasn\u2019t holding his breath for a good night in New York. Aides said if he could hold Trump under 90 of the state\u2019s 95 delegates, even that would count as an acceptable result. Kasich\u2019s strategy of eating just about everything in sight \u2013 pizza with a fork at Gino\u2019s Pizzeria, soup, a pickle and apple strudel at PJ Bernstein Deli, a massive sub at Mike\u2019s Deli \u2013 helped him to a distant second-place finish, but did earn him a few delegates, denying Trump a clean sweep of his home state. Kasich eats New York pizza with a fork The Ohio governor is hoping the next week\u2019s contests allow him to rack up delegates in moderate, suburban congressional districts, using that as a starting point for his argument that he\u2019s the Republican best positioned to take on Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be deadlocked\u201d going into the Republican National Convention, Kasich said Tuesday night in Maryland. \u201cThen what delegates are going to do is do something crazy \u2013 consider who can win in the fall.\u201d The Democratic contest has become increasingly heated and personal in recent days \u2013 but even as Sanders amps up the attacks and Clinton\u2019s campaign frets over the potential impact, the party\u2019s primary voters don\u2019t seem worried. Sixty-seven percent of Democratic voters surveyed in early exit polls said the campaign between Sanders and Clinton has energized the party, while just 29% said it has divided the party. In the short term, the extended primary is frustrating Clinton\u2019s camp. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri called Sanders\u2019 campaign \u201cdestructive\u201d to the point that Sanders\u2019 continuation in the race is \u201cnot productive to Democrats\u201d and \u201cnot productive for the country.\u201d But in the long run, Democratic voters\u2019 engagement and interest in the contest could help Clinton, who will need to consolidate Sanders\u2019 supporters if she clinches the nomination \u2013 and could find it easier to do that if they\u2019re not turned off by an extended intra-party battle. Among New York Republicans, it\u2019s a different story. Sixty percent say the GOP campaign has divided the party, compared to 36% who say it has energized it. That could have something to do with the state\u2019s leading candidate, Trump, consistently declaring the nominating process \u201crigged\u201d against him. The numbers show that Republicans could have the tougher challenge in bringing the party together behind its eventual nominee. Trump\u2019s Tuesday rout punctuated that reality. His victory made clear that no other Republican stands a chance of catching him at the polls \u2013 even as party members fight to deny him delegates.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton, confident that winning the New York primary on Tuesday could all but lock up the Democratic nomination, campaigned in the days leading up to the contest more like a New York City mayoral candidate than someone running for president. During a frenetic eight-stop day in New York City on Monday, Clinton stopped at a car wash in Queens to celebrate recently unionized workers, drank boba tea and chatted with workers steaming dumplings in Flatbush and got ice cream \u2013 booing a reporter who asked about calories \u2013 in the East Village. The close contact, jam-packed campaigning was unique for Clinton who is considered a less-than-stellar retail politician. It also came on the heels of a whirlwind fundraising trip to California, so the frenzy of New York stops was well timed on the eve of the primary. Hillary and Bill Clinton voted on Tuesday morning at Douglas G. Grafflin Elementary School in Chappaqua, the same polling place they have been visiting since 2000, when the couple moved from the White House to the small hamlet north of New York City. As Chappaqua\u2019s most famous residents, their voting was as much a campaign stop as it was a civic duty. The Clintons were greeted by around 50 supporters at the polling location, all positioned 100 feet away from the door in order to follow New York election law. Inside the polling place, people in line to vote urged the 2016 candidate to jump the line and cast her ballot. \u201cNo, you need to vote,\u201d one prospective voter said to the possible Democratic nominee. \u201cI wonder who they voted for,\u201d whispered another woman to her friend. After Clinton marked her ballot \u2013 something she told the press was \u201cprivate\u201d \u2013 the former secretary of state walked over to submit it. Standing behind her in line: a teenage girl dressed up as the former first lady, blonde wig and all. \u201cThis has been a joy during the last two weeks to be here all over the state and I hope everyone gets out to vote,\u201d Clinton said outside the polling place, cautious to violate election laws by talking politics. \u201cI had a great time going around the city in the last couple days. Just seeing a lot of old friends, meeting new people. And I just urge everybody, please come out and vote before 9 p.m. tonight.\u201d New York has been Clinton\u2019s home for 16 years and many of her friends say it is the place were she is most at ease. That showed as Clinton campaigned throughout the state for the last two weeks. At times, the typically cautious Clinton let her guard down and grew blunt with supporters. \u201cI am hoping to do really well tomorrow, I am hoping to wrap up the Democratic nomination,\u201d Clinton told a group of gay and lesbian activists at a phone back in Manhattan on Monday. When the audience went wild, Clinton realized what she said and quickly reoriented herself to say that she wasn\u2019t looking past Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, something she says so often it has become a campaign trail cliche. \u201cBut, but, but, I am not taking anything for granted,\u201d Clinton said as the cheers subsided. \u201cI have to quickly add that before anyone has the wrong impression.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign, despite regularly touting their sizable delegate lead over Sanders, has been careful to seem like they are already focusing on the general election. Clinton herself has argued that she is able to \u201cwalk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d meaning she can go after Republicans like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz while still worrying about Sanders. But internally aides have grown confident that they will win the New York primary on Tuesday night, buoyed in large part by African-American and Latino voters in New York City and the surrounding suburbs. Polls show Sanders has proven strong in upstate New York, an area Clinton visited three times while campaigning in the state. But Clinton aides feel that the bulk of delegates in and around New York City will prove insurmountable for Sanders\u2019 operation. The day before the primary, Sanders\u2019 campaign accused Clinton\u2019s operation of using their joint fundraising agreement with the Democratic National Committee as a way to skirt campaign finance laws. Committee aides knocked down Sanders\u2019 accusation, flatly saying that the Democratic organization is not subsidizing the Clinton campaign\u2019s fundraising. The kerfuffle, while also refuted by the Clinton campaign, allowed Clinton\u2019s campaign manager Robby Mook to tip his hand on his confidence about the last eight weeks of the Democratic primary. \u201cSen. Sanders needs to decide, as it appears likelier and likelier that Secretary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee, if he wants to continue down this destructive path or get back to the debate on the issues,\u201d Mook said. Clinton didn\u2019t match this rhetoric while she campaigned in New York over the weekend. Though she hit Sanders on guns, abortion and his ability to implement his campaign promises, she focused more on retail campaigning during her time in New York City. Clinton visited Hi-Tek Wash & Lube in Queens to congratulate workers who has recently unionized on Monday. A worker at the car wash told Clinton in Spanish that he recently won an election as part of his union. Clinton nodded excitedly after the comment was translated by another worker. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I win an election tomorrow!\u201d",

            "article_content": "Watch CNN and NY1\u2019s Democratic debate, moderated by Wolf Blitzer, Thursday, April 14 at 9 p.m. ET. Cruz's win over Trump means a contested GOP convention may be probable Bernie Sanders scored another big win over Hillary Clinton The race shifts to New York, where Clinton and Trump will be favored Ted Cruz\u2019s win over Donald Trump in Wisconsin means a contested GOP convention is not only possible, but may be probable. And Bernie Sanders reminded Hillary Clinton that the Democratic race isn\u2019t over yet. Wisconsin was a must-win for both Cruz and Sanders as the 2016 race shifts to New York, where both front-runners will try to regain their footing in the state they call home. Both did just that \u2013 and they racked up big margins of victory, with Cruz besting Trump by 15 percentage points and Sanders ahead of Clinton by 13 points. Here are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s contests: For Trump, getting the delegate math to add up to 1,237 before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland was always a tall task. Who's running for president? It just got much more difficult. Cruz win moves GOP closer to contested convention Cruz\u2019s big Wisconsin win raises the possibility that Trump romps in the Northeast, wins California and still comes up just short, throwing the nominating battle into a contested convention. Cruz tried again to consolidate the anti-Trump movement, touting in a Milwaukee speech the $2 million he said his campaign has raised Tuesday alone. What is a brokered convention? He also made a play to unify Republicans, dropping his usual attacks on Trump and instead taking aim at Clinton in his victory speech. \u201cEither before Cleveland or at the convention in Cleveland, together, we will win a majority of the delegates, and together, we will beat Hillary Clinton in November,\u201d Cruz said. Ted Cruz: Now the odds-on favorite The Texas senator\u2019s supporters \u2013 and Republicans allied with anybody whose name isn\u2019t Trump \u2013 crowed that Wisconsin marked a turning point in the race, especially as Trump watches delegates slip away in states he\u2019s already won because his campaign hasn\u2019t mastered the contest\u2019s procedural intricacies. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up \u201cGOP voters in Wisconsin rejected Donald Trump just like the entire Republican base will do in Cleveland this summer,\u201d Katie Packer, a Republican strategist who helms the anti-Trump Our Principles PAC, said in a statement. The good news for Trump: The next stop is New York, where the billionaire calls home and is up in the polls. But Wisconsin shows he has some brand maintenance to do. Voters in Wisconsin just weren\u2019t as angry, or frustrated, with Republican leadership as voters in other states. Four in 10 say they\u2019re scared about Trump as the nominee. And many said Trump, not the man he has branded \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d has run the most dishonest campaign. Coming off perhaps the worst week of his campaign, Trump \u2013 who\u2019d claimed as recently as Tuesday morning that he thought he\u2019d win the Badger State \u2013 fell far short. He split the vote with Cruz of Republicans who said they wanted a candidate who could bring change. He was blown away by those worried about electability. One especially concerning figure for Trump: He was blown out by 22 percentage points by Cruz in suburban areas and 13 points in urban areas, compared to just 3 points in rural areas. That\u2019s bad news as the race moves to the densely-populated east coast. That all explains why Trump lost, and lays out the challenges he confronts: Now he has to face down adversity and appear, in his own words, \u201cmore presidential.\u201d The only silver lining might have been that there was no significant gender gap \u2013 an indication Trump\u2019s two stumbles and subsequent reversals over abortion didn\u2019t depress his support from women. Sanders  got an affirmation of his momentum, with six wins in the last seven contests. He will need that momentum to stay strong if he\u2019s going to truly knock Clinton off her heels. To keep his streak going, Sanders will need to beat her out east \u2013 in New York on April 19, and then in some combination of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware the following week. In those states, Sanders will be competing without his typical advantages. In Wisconsin, loyal Democrats split 50-50, but Sanders won independents 71-29. The east coast races, though, are closed contests \u2013 which means only registered Democrats can participate, limiting his ability to bring new, young voters into the process. Bernie Sanders in the spotlight Exit polls: Wisconsin primary voters say trade leads to job loss What Wisconsin gives Sanders is the ability to keep raising big dollars, and keep his supporters energized in states where organizational work will be especially important. He has outraised Clinton, $109 million to $75 million, in the last three months. Before heading east, Sanders made a stop in Laramie, Wyoming, where he\u2019ll try to make it seven out of eight states when that state holds its caucuses Saturday. \u201cI was told that about 5,000 people participated in the last Wyoming caucus. It looks like all of them are here tonight,\u201d he joked as he started his speech, leaning hard into one buzzword: \u201cMomentum.\u201d \u201cI know a little bit about New York because I spent the first 18 years of my life in Brooklyn, New York. Now please keep this a secret \u2013 do not tell Secretary Clinton; she\u2019s getting a little nervous and I don\u2019t want her to get more nervous \u2013 but I believe we\u2019ve got an excellent chance to win New York and a lot of delegates in that state,\u201d he said. Wisconsin was the kind of state \u2013 overwhelmingly white, and independents are allowed into party primaries \u2013 that Sanders had to win. And he did: He crushed Clinton among voters 18-29 by his standard margin of 82% to 18%, and won those 30-44, two to one. He won white voters, 59% to 41%. That number was flipped among non-whites, but in Wisconsin, 83% of the Democratic electorate was white. States like New York that are far more diverse have proven to be Clinton country. And the former secretary of state is wasting no time welcoming Sanders back to the state where he grew up. Pennsylvania poll: Trump, Clinton lead rivals Bernie Sanders feeling media heat after new interview Readers of The New York Daily News will see a front-page story Wednesday denouncing \u201cBernie\u2019s Sandy Hook shame.\u201d Sanders Tuesday faced blistering criticism over his interview with the newspaper\u2019s editorial board, where he seemed unable to go beyond top-level talking points on his core policy issues, like breaking up the big banks. In an unusual move, Clinton\u2019s campaign sent out the entire Sanders transcript as  part of a fundraising email. \u201cWe\u2019ve said for a long time that this primary is about who\u2019s really going to be able to get things done. And from reading this interview, you get the impression Senator Sanders hasn\u2019t thought very much about that. In fact, even on his signature issue of breaking up the banks, he\u2019s unable to answer basic questions about how he\u2019d go about doing it, and even seems uncertain whether a president does or doesn\u2019t already have that authority under existing law,\u201d Clinton aide Christina Reynolds wrote. In Wisconsin, Clinton says Sanders is a Democrat-come-lately If Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s experience of three statewide wins in four years shows anything, it\u2019s that Republicans can win in Wisconsin. But Cruz and Trump may have an uphill climb in November. Exit polls showed that only 62% of Republicans said they\u2019d vote for Trump in the fall. Another 10% said if he\u2019s the nominee, they\u2019d support Clinton, while 17% said they\u2019d back a third-party candidate and 8% said they wouldn\u2019t vote at all. For Cruz, the numbers were similar: 66% said they\u2019d vote for him, while 6% said they\u2019d back Clinton. But 18% said they\u2019d pick a third-party candidate, and another 6% would stay home. It\u2019s an ominous sign for the fall. Wisconsin isn\u2019t a must-win state for a Republican in the general election \u2013 but it is winnable, and, like Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, it\u2019s home to a vulnerable senator (Ron Johnson) who the GOP hopes will be part of a governing majority next year. Those exit poll numbers are, in theory, good for John Kasich, because they bolster his argument that he\u2019s the only electable Republican left standing. But the Ohio governor has his own problems. The same factors that hurt Trump \u2013 Wisconsin is highly educated and less angry \u2013 should have helped Kasich. Yet he finished a distant third, once again failing to lend any credibility to his case for staying in the race.",

            "article_content": "Watch CNN and NY1\u2019s Democratic debate, moderated by Wolf Blitzer, Thursday, April 14 at 9 p.m. ET. Cruz looks to win big and keep Trump from getting the delegates he needs to get closer to clinching the GOP nomination Sanders hopes to secure another win against Clinton after sweeping Western Saturday Two candidates vying to take down their parties\u2019 front-runners could get big boosts if they win Tuesday in Wisconsin. Wisconsin primary critical for Donald Trump Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is leading Donald Trump in the Badger State\u2019s polls. And a Bernie Sanders win would mark his sixth victory over Hillary Clinton in the last seven states to vote. It\u2019s the last big test until April 19, and each candidate has a lot to win \u2014 or lose. Here are five things to watch Tuesday: Trump is coming off the worst week of his 2016 race. His campaign manager was charged with battery. He stepped into two controversies over abortion in three days, both forcing him to issue rare reversals. And he lost state-level fights over delegates to Cruz in North Dakota, Tennessee and Colorado. Wisconsin is the first electoral test of whether he\u2019s paying a price. Trump\u2019s campaign says it\u2019s expecting a close race in Wisconsin. It\u2019s \u201ca toss-up,\u201d senior adviser Barry Bennett told CNN. But the polls show Cruz with a 10-point lead in Wisconsin \u2013 and if that margin grows Tuesday, it\u2019d be a sign that the controversies swirling around Trump\u2019s campaign are taking their toll. Still, Trump was inflating expectations Monday in La Crosse. \u201cI really believe tomorrow were going to have a very, very big victory. Very very big,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been up here a lot. And I love it, and the people I love.\u201d Donald Trump's empire If Cruz wins, it would make Trump\u2019s path to 1,237 delegates before the Republican National Convention precarious. In a tight three-way race, he has little room for error, even with east coast states Trump should win up next. It\u2019s made more complicated by Cruz\u2019s mastery of the intricate rules and details of the nominating process \u2013 which has left Trump crying foul and threatening lawsuits in states like Louisiana, where Cruz netted 10 more delegates than Trump even though Trump won the state. \u201cHis team doesn\u2019t understand how these processes work so any time they lose they scream, \u2018The election\u2019s been stolen from us,\u2019\u201d Cruz said Monday on WISN radio in Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s just silliness.\u201d A loss would dent Trump. But it would crush Cruz, who has retail politicked his way across the Badger State as if it were Iowa in recent weeks. While Trump is trying to claim a national movement, Cruz is waging a state-by-state, delegate-by-delegate knife fight to keep Trump from clinching the GOP nomination. He\u2019ll try to pick up 42 more in Wisconsin: 18 that go to the statewide winner, plus 24 more chosen three apiece by the state\u2019s eight congressional districts. Moments from Ted Cruz's career Wisconsin is also a test of the strength of the anti-Trump movement that Cruz is trying to lead. And it willl gauge whether popular, high-level endorsements from the likes of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush help push Cruz over the top. Part of Wisconsin\u2019s importance to Cruz is that the calendar soon shifts to shakier ground for him. He\u2019s favored in the winner-take-all South Dakota, Montana and Nebraska contests, but could lose big in the next contest on the calendar, New York on April 19, and then Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware the following week. CNN delegate estimate \u201cJust a couple of weeks ago, all of the media commentators were saying Wisconsin was a state that  I could not compete and do well,\u201d Cruz said Monday in Kenosha. \u201cThey were saying it was a state that was a natural state for Donald Trump. The state historically has been a purple or even a blue state at times. It\u2019s a state that is, that is very heavily based on manufacturing, that has a lot of union members and working class members. Supposedly, it was Donald Trump\u2019s sweet spot, and yet I think the people of Wisconsin, they\u2019re looking at the records of the candidates, and they realize that Donald screams and yells a lot, but he has no solutions.\u201d He was swept in the South, and bloodied in the Rust Belt. But when the race shifted West, Bernie Sanders won five out of six states, regaining his footing and bolstering his argument to take the race all the way through the last contests on June 7. Opinion: Clinton is winning but Sanders is no loser A win in Wisconsin would give him a significant boost just as the race heads to New York \u2013 the state where he was born, and which Clinton represented in the Senate. It would also give him victories in six out of the seven states in the month leading up to it \u2013 helping to fuel the passion and small-dollar donations driving his candidacy. Win or lose, Sanders\u2019 path to the Democratic nomination is a tight one. The party awards its delegates on a proportional basis, so there are no must-win states where he can place big bets the way Republicans have. He\u2019ll have to win on the coasts \u2013 and that includes New York and its surrounding territory. Clinton, Sanders to meet for Brooklyn debate At a rowdy Monday evening rally in Milwaukee, Sanders talked repeatedly about \u201cmomentum\u201d \u2013 touting poll results, his growth from 2015 and a string of recent victories. \u201cTomorrow, if there is a good turnout here in Wisconsin, if there is a record-breaking turnout here in Wisconsin, we are going to win here as well,\u201d he said. Clinton\u2019s campaign has downplayed the Wisconsin primary for weeks, arguing that the state\u2019s results won\u2019t tip the delegate count significantly in either direction. The former secretary of state wasn\u2019t even in Wisconsin on Monday \u2013 instead campaigning in New York, where she faces a closer-than-expected contest in two weeks. In Wisconsin, Clinton says Sanders is a Democrat-come-lately Obviously Clinton would be delighted with a win, but no matter what, she will leave Wisconsin with a clear delegate lead. But, like Michigan in early March, the state could also leave her with a tougher-than-expected primary on her hands and in a position to explain to backers why she can\u2019t put the self-described democratic socialist away. How Sanders fares when it comes to delegates For more than a month, Clinton has tried to shift her attention to Republicans and the general election. Yet much like Clinton against then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, Sanders\u2019 persistent presence won\u2019t allow it. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook is telling supporters not to worry. Clinton casts Sanders as \u2018pie in the sky\u2019 in Wisconsin In a memo posted on Medium Monday evening, Mook wrote: \u201cSanders has to win the four remaining delegate-rich primaries \u2013 New York, Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey \u2013 with roughly 60% of the vote. To put that in perspective: Sanders has thus far won only two primaries with that margin: Vermont and New Hampshire.\u201d He calls the campaign\u2019s delegate lead \u201cnearly insurmountable.\u201d Ohio Gov. John Kasich has still won only a single state \u2013 his own. And he\u2019s increasingly under pressure from both Trump and Cruz, who are angling behind the scenes for GOP convention rules that would keep him off the first ballot there, and publicly for him to depart the race. Donald Trump: John Kasich hurting me more than Ted Cruz \u201cHe ought to get the hell out, honestly,\u201d Trump said Monday in La Crosse. He compared Kasich to Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \u2013 \u201cevery single candidate that went out and worked hard, that frankly, in most cases, have done much better than Kasich.\u201d Trump: Kasich shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run Rubio, in fact, still has more delegates than Kasich. \u201cHe\u2019s just a stubborn guy,\u201d Trump said of Kasich. \u201cHe\u2019s stubborn. He doesn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d Wisconsin, just like Michigan and Illinois before it, is the sort of state where Kasich ought to have a strong showing. Public polls have showed him within striking distance of Trump for second place \u2013 and finishing ahead of Trump would be a major boost.",

            "article_content": "Attacks on popular Gov. Scott Walker are hurting Trump with GOP voters The Wisconsin \"establishment\" is popular in inside the state Donald Trump made quick work of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker when the two were Republican presidential primary opponents last year, lumping the popular conservative in with a crowded slate of political insiders. But now that the GOP\u2019s nominating contest has arrived in Walker\u2019s home state, the tables have turned \u2013 and the billionaire\u2019s anti-establishment rhetoric appears to be falling flat with the party base. \u201cYour governor came out, he was expected to win and we sent him packing like a little boy,\u201d Trump said during an interview with radio host Michael Koolidge last Tuesday, on the same morning Walker announced he would back Trump rival Ted Cruz. Trump\u2019s decision to repeatedly attack Walker has angered large portions of the party base and left many political analysts dumbfounded. Despite his early exit from the national contest, the governor remains an immensely popular figure among Wisconsin Republicans, with eight-in-ten approving of the job he\u2019s done as governor. \u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump respects the voters of Wisconsin,\u201d Brandon Scholz, a long-time Republican strategist and lobbyist in the state, said on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s clueless.\u201d Where Trump has generally found success blustering into states as varied as Michigan and Arizona, quickly winning over disaffected Republicans with his anti-establishment message and raucous political theater, Wisconsin has proven a tougher nut to crack. Hardened by more than five years of pitched battles over labor rights and a 2011 recall election, Trump\u2019s rhetoric is being met here with more skeptical ears. And a GOP voter base which, unlike so many others, holds its state leaders \u2013 people like Walker, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Wisconsin native RNC chairman Reince Priebus \u2013 in high regard. If taking shots at Walker, as Trump did during an event in Janesville last week, was part of his strategy for the state, Scholz added, then it represents a terrible miscalculation. \u201cMaybe in his mind and some others this is a political tactic, that they can get people engaged and thinking that there\u2019s a lot of anti-Walker Republicans \u2013 which there aren\u2019t, he\u2019s got an 80% approval rating \u2013 then maybe (Trump) can, as he does in other places, get his earned media that way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s backfired, it\u2019s backfired terribly.\u201d Scholz, who is unaligned in 2016, also questioned Trump\u2019s decision last week to visit the city, home to popular House Speaker Ryan. \u201cYou don\u2019t poke Ryan in the eye,\u201d he said, noting the speaker\u2019s rare popularity with both very conservative and moderate Republicans. \u201cThat\u2019s just stupid.\u201d The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding their strategy. The most recent horse race numbers show Cruz surging, with a 10-point lead in the respected Marquette Law School poll. Trump, meanwhile, is stuck on 30% support among likely GOP voters, the same as in February, when then-fellow candidates Marco Rubio and Ben Carson were still in the race. Among those backing Cruz is Tim Felski, a 52-year-old bus driver, who concedes that, on paper at least, he fits the bill for what one might expect in a Trump supporter \u2013 white, middle-aged, middle-income and a lifelong Republican. But Trump, he said on Sunday, is \u201ctoo out there for me. Too fanatical, too loose with the lips, just doesn\u2019t do it for me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want somebody like that, who I just don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do from day-to-day,\u201d said Felski, an active Milwaukee County Republican and friend of Walker\u2019s going back to their undergrad days at Marquette University. \u201cHe seems like he\u2019s more into this for egoistical reasons and not because he wants to run the nation in the best way possible.\u201d Now, Trump\u2019s decision not to play ball with Republican leaders in a state where the party controls all three branches of government is poised to hurt him with the grassroots. \u201cHe has never worked elites in the state,\u201d said Barry Burden, the director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s Elections Research Center. \u201cHe has no endorsements, essentially, from any state legislators. He\u2019s tried to talk to conservative talk radio earlier this week, and that was a failure.\u201d Wisconsin\u2019s right-wing radio hosts have been among Trump\u2019s most eager and organized opponents. Last week, the real estate mogul walked into a buzzsaw when he went on the air with Charlie Sykes, a host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee and vocal member of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement. \u201cNobody snapped him up and said, \u2018Hey, by the way, this guy\u2019s hashtag Never Trump?\u2019\u201d Brandon Scholz asked incredulously, pointing to the incident as still more evidence to underline the campaign\u2019s lack of knowledge about the state. Jerry Bader, another top talker on Wisconsin\u2019s radio scene, told CNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish this weekend that he viewed Trump\u2019s recent abortion flap \u2013 the candidate lurched from talk of punishing women who seek the procedure to a vaguer promise to reverse the current law through judicial appointments \u2013 as a strong signal that the leading Republican presidential candidate lacked real conservative credentials. RELATED: Is Wisconsin Donald Trump\u2019s Waterloo? \u201cThe beef with Donald Trump is he\u2019s not real, he\u2019s not pro-life. He has no idea what the pro-life answer should be,\u201d Bader said. \u201cHe is trying to figure out what a conservative should sound like. That\u2019s why he blows in the wind, that\u2019s why there\u2019s no substance there. That\u2019s our beef with him, besides his boorish, childish, playground behavior.\u201d Questions surrounding Trump\u2019s demeanor and attitude toward GOP leadership \u2013 the same that worry the political class nationally \u2013 were on display Sunday at Buck Bradley\u2019s Saloon in Milwaukee, where residents of the more conservative suburbs streamed in and out ahead of sporting events at the nearby BMO Harris Bradley Center. Tending the upstairs bar that afternoon, Juston Edwards, 32, a Janesville native who recently received an MBA in finance, suggested that Wisconsin voters have a longer memory than others \u2013 likely to Trump\u2019s detriment. \u201cPeople here are engaged, so they get upset, the conservatives do, when you attack the governor,\u201d he said, making reference to Trump\u2019s lukewarm comments about Walker during the 2011 public sector union fight. \u201cHe\u2019s done so much for the tea party movement, he\u2019s done so much for the party, he\u2019s done so much to put conservative values to the test \u2013 taxes, cutting the budget, cutting waste \u2013 he\u2019s done exactly everything that they wanted him to do,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cSo when you have a guy like Trump who criticizes all that, people get upset.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump trails Ted Cruz in the polls ahead of Wisconsin's Tuesday primary A loss in Wisconsin would complicate Trump's path to the 1,237 delegates to win the GOP nomination Tuesday\u2019s Wisconsin primary is the best chance for Republicans to deal Donald Trump a major loss just before the race shifts to East Coast states where he\u2019s expected to dominate. But it comes after his rockiest week yet on the campaign trail, with Trump \u2013 so far made of Teflon, seemingly immune from the ill effects of the controversies he\u2019s triggered \u2013 at risk of suddenly looking vulnerable, particularly after reversing himself several times within 72 hours on issues related to abortion. Mathematically, Wisconsin won\u2019t make or break Trump\u2019s path to the Republican nomination, but a loss here could make it much harder for the Republican front-runner to clinch the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cThe conversation\u2019s going to be, \u2018This is going to go to an open convention.\u2019 I think you\u2019re going to see that discussion really go through the roof,\u201d said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster and chief strategist for the anti-Trump Our Principles PAC. Trump: Kasich shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run Wisconsin should be Trump Country: His trade-bashing, blue-state, working-class appeal in manufacturing states like this one is at the core of his case he can win in November. But days before the state\u2019s Tuesday primary, polls show him trailing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 and with Ohio Gov. John Kasich not far behind. His path to 1,237 delegates was already precarious. Then Trump stepped into two abortion controversies \u2013 suggesting women who undergo the procedure should be punished if abortions were outlawed, and then saying current federal policies should stay the same, both stances his aides quickly reversed in statements. It has put him at risk of losing more female supporters \u2013 with Wisconsin posing the first test. The White House goes nuclear on Donald Trump Wisconsin has 42 delegates on the line. Of those, 18 go to the statewide winner, while the other 24 are divvied up three apiece to the winner of each of Wisconsin\u2019s eight congressional districts. Even by winning all 42, Cruz wouldn\u2019t make it impossible for Trump to win the 1,237 he needs to clinch the party\u2019s nomination before its convention in Cleveland, where there will also be a pool of unpledged delegates available to every candidate. But a Cruz win would have two tangible effects on the race. Increasingly, the inside-baseball games would matter more \u2013 an advantage for Cruz and Kasich over Trump. From the attention to detail that allowed Cruz to net 10 more delegates than Trump in Louisiana, despite the real-estate mogul winning there, to the legal ramifications of disavowing his pledge to back the eventual GOP nominee in South Carolina, the quirks of each state\u2019s rules would become critical to a Trump campaign that has eschewed those intricacies. Cruz allies prevail in the North Dakota delegate race Wisconsin is also a confidence game. It plays an oversized role in the GOP contest because it\u2019s the only major contest in a four-week stretch. A big Cruz win pokes another hole in Trump\u2019s inevitability, lending Trump\u2019s opponents \u2013 and the donors backing the right\u2019s stop-Trump efforts \u2013 a sense that they could win the fight. Trump\u2019s campaign is contending to win Wisconsin, and says it views the state as a toss-up. Yet his aides are downplaying the effects of a loss there. \u201cWe want to win every delegate everywhere, so every loss is disappointing. But it\u2019s not one of our must-win states,\u201d said Barry Bennett, a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign. He said he has modeled a path to 1,450 delegates for Trump that included zero from Wisconsin. \u201cI conservatively couldn\u2019t count on it for anything. My crystal ball does not work there,\u201d he said, arguing that while areas like Janesville do reflect Midwestern states Trump has already won, Milwaukee tends to vote more like Chicago, while Madison is a college town that\u2019s difficult to project. Could Republican Convention delegates be bought? Bennett also pointed to the race\u2019s move to the East Coast \u2013 New York is next on April 19, followed by Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island the next week \u2013 as a big opportunity for Trump to rack up delegates. \u201cI love cheese curds and beer as much as the next guy, but New York two weeks later, we\u2019re already over 50%, which means we win all 95\u201d delegates, Bennett said. Goeas, though, sees Wisconsin as a critical stage in the race. Trump\u2019s string of controversies around women \u2013 from his Twitter insults of Heidi Cruz\u2019s looks to his comments about abortion \u2013 have alienated female voters and sent the intensity of the one-third of the GOP that is dead-set on stopping Trump soaring to match the one-third that is with him no matter what, Goeas said. That puts Trump in a bind: If he\u2019s not crushing his competition, he can\u2019t back away from the bombastic rhetoric he\u2019s employed for the last year \u2013 otherwise, he\u2019d risk losing his own supporters. But the longer he uses such language, the more hardened and intense the resistance becomes. Either way, Trump\u2019s long-term viability \u2013 for the Republican nomination, or in the general election \u2013 would suffer. \u201cHe has to stay with his image he has, the way he campaigns, because if he starts taking his foot off the pedal at all, he then loses enthusiasm with his third,\u201d Goeas said. \u201cIt puts him in a box.\u201d The contest comes after one of Trump\u2019s most difficult weeks on the campaign trail. Still under fire for retweeting an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz, and facing high disapproval ratings among women, Trump stepped into another controversy on Wednesday in a town hall interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews. Asked about abortion, Trump said that women who undergo the procedure should face \u201csome form of punishment.\u201d Within hours, his campaign had released a statement reversing his position \u2013 but it was too late to tamp down criticism from both those who oppose abortion rights, who generally see women as victims of the procedure, as well as those who support abortion rights. Then, two days later, Trump set off another controversy when he told CBS that abortion laws should not change on the federal level \u2013 another position that forced his campaign to backtrack later in the day, issuing a statement saying Trump only meant until he\u2019s president and can appoint judges who see abortion as a states\u2019-rights issue. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s been the worst week of my campaign,\u201d Trump said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in an interview aired Sunday. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had many bad weeks and I\u2019ve had many good weeks. I don\u2019t see this as the worst week in my campaign.\u201d If Friday night at the Republican Party of Milwaukee County\u2019s fish fry was any indication of Trump\u2019s fortunes in Wisconsin, he has an uphill climb. Cruz \u2013 who\u2019d been introduced by the state\u2019s popular governor, Scott Walker \u2013 eviscerated Trump\u2019s foreign policy positions, saying they call into question Trump\u2019s \u201cfitness and judgment to be commander in chief.\u201d \u201cNominating Donald Trump elects Hillary Clinton. Hillary not only wins, she wins by a big margin,\u201d Cruz said. Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and Trump surrogate, was on hand to make Trump\u2019s pitch, but she received a chilly reception. Palin received polite applause, but it paled in comparison not just to Kasich and Cruz but to local broadcast personalities who spoke in between candidates. Palin lambasted the GOP establishment, saying the country needs a break from \u201cthe same old politicos and insiders who betrayed us over and over again\u201d and declaring: \u201cEnough of the holier-than-now lectures from those steering us into rocky shores.\u201d And she made the case that Trump\u2019s positions aren\u2019t detached from the Republican platform, comparing his anti-trade stances to Ronald Reagan. She also took a shot at Cruz, arguing that he\u2019s soft on trade. \u201cYou have to ask yourself, who is this? It\u2019s not someone who understands Ronald Reagan,\u201d Palin said. But when Palin pitched \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s positions,\u201d a man in the audience jeered: \u201cWhat positions?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats get nasty Trump flip flops. Again When the Badger State votes on Tuesday, it could give America something more like Groundhog Day: several more weeks of an intense primary campaign. Republicans waged a two-front fight this weekend \u2013 in Wisconsin, which holds an important Tuesday primary that will set the tone for the presidential race in the next two weeks before New York votes, and at delegate-selection meetings across the country, where candidates are angling for a leg up in case the GOP holds a contested convention. Here\u2019s a look at the political action heading into a week that could reshape the race: Despite running second place nationally, both Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on the Republican side and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders among the Democrats are well-positioned to pick up victories in the primary here. Wins would give both campaigns shots of momentum. For Cruz, it\u2019s an especially important contest if he\u2019s to hold Republican front-runner Donald Trump short of the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the GOP nomination. And for Sanders, it\u2019d help him look viable headed into a spate of East Coast contests that Clinton\u2019s campaign hopes will seal her victory. All five candidates blanketed Wisconsin over the weekend, each firing up supporters at their rallies. The main attractions were a Republican dinner in Milwaukee on Friday night, followed by a Democratic one Saturday night. The most telling reception from Wisconsin voters could have been the chilly one given to Sarah Palin, who stumped for Trump at a Milwaukee County GOP event Friday night. The audience, which had greeted Palin polite applause, hardly tried to hide its eye-rolls as she argued that Trump is the true conservative heir to Ronald Reagan. When Palin made her case for \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s positions,\u201d a man in the audience jeered: \u201cWhat positions?\u201d Trump can win 1,237 delegates and clinch the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland \u2013 or he can be stopped. Either way, the math will be close. So North Dakota, Tennessee and Colorado were all closely watched this weekend \u2013 and all represented bad news for Trump. Cruz made a visit to Fargo, North Dakota, where state Republican officials were choosing 25 delegates to the Republican National Convention on Sunday. These delegates could be especially important when the convention comes, because they\u2019re free agents \u2013 unbound by state rules and able to vote for anyone. Trump\u2019s campaign was furious when Tennessee, meanwhile, picked a slate of delegates that includes several choices who are obligated to back Trump through the Republican National Convention\u2019s initial two rounds of balloting \u2013 but then would likely bolt for another candidate. In Colorado, Cruz picked up all six delegates available in the first stage of the state\u2019s complicated selection process, shutting Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich out of delegates from two congressional districts. Delegates from the state\u2019s other districts will be chosen Thursday and Friday. Hillary Clinton campaign strategist Joel Benenson\u2019s call a week ago for Sanders to improve his \u201ctone\u201d and focus his criticism on Republicans has backfired. The front-runner and delegate leader would like to shift her focus to taking on Republicans in the general election. But Sanders isn\u2019t going away. He could win Tuesday in Wisconsin and he\u2019s competing hard in New York, which votes on April 19. The two have also traded sharper exchanges in recent days, starting Thursday when Clinton told Greenpeace activists that she was \u201cso sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me\u201d taking fossil fuel industry donations. Then, Sanders demanded an apology, saying his critique of Clinton is true. A Washington Post fact-checker was critical of Sanders\u2019 assertions, noting that both campaigns have received money from oil and gas industry employees, and that Clinton has benefitted from lobbyists who work for those industries \u2013 but that those lobbyists have multiple clients, so it\u2019s inaccurate to cast their fundraising efforts as money \u201cgiven\u201d by fossil fuel interests. Confronted with that fact-check, Sanders didn\u2019t back down Sunday. \u201cLet the voters decide whether paid lobbyists who represent the fossil fuel industry, 43 of them, gave maximum contributions to the Clinton campaign and whether or not these same people are out in some cases bundling, trying to bring in even more money,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d In Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on Saturday, Clinton also beat up Sanders for only joining the Democratic Party when he launched his presidential campaign. \u201cI am also a Democrat and have been a proud Democrat all my adult life,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I think that is kind of important if we are selecting someone to be the Democratic nominee of the Democratic Party.\u201d Trump had already angered both sides of the abortion debate last week when he suggested that women who undergo abortions should face \u201csome form of punishment\u201d if they were illegal \u2013 and then reversed himself almost immediately, when the political danger of that position was apparent. Then, on Friday, he did it again. Trump set off his second abortion-related controversy in 72 hours when he told CBS News that federal laws should not be changed to outlaw abortion. \u201cAt this moment the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way,\u201d Trump said. Once again, Trump\u2019s aides were forced to backtrack, with spokeswoman Hope Hicks saying Trump was merely describing the state of play until he\u2019s elected president and can appoint judges who would turn abortion into a states\u2019-rights question. It was the latest episode in a string \u2013 from his tepid answers to questions about white supremacists on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d in late February to the incidents of violence that have surrounded his campaign events and staff \u2013 that have given establishment Republicans reason to worry that Trump\u2019s nomination could have negative down-ballot effects, particularly if his sky-high disapproval rate among women doesn\u2019t improve. Overall, 73% of female voters in a mid-March CNN/ORC poll said they had a negative view of Trump, while just 26% view him positively. Increasingly, it appears Clinton and Sanders will debate again before New York\u2019s April 19 primary. Both candidates say they are \u201cconfident\u201d that their campaigns will find a workable date for a debate ahead of the New York primary. But the two sides are not in agreement yet. While the Clinton campaign is aiming for the evening of April 14, the Sanders campaign is resisting that date. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure how that works on our schedule. We may have a major rally being scheduled,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Clinton brought up the April 14 proposal on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d and asked, \u201cIs he in?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m confident that there will be\u201d a debate before the April 19 primary, Clinton said, but added, \u201cI\u2019m not the one negotiating it. That\u2019s going on between our campaigns. And I do know my campaign has really been trying to get a time that Sen. Sanders\u2019 campaign would agree with.\u201d CNN, NBC and ABC are among the networks seeking to host a debate between the two Democratic candidates. He might not like to attack his Republican presidential rivals \u2013 but Kasich is under siege himself. Trump said he wants Kasich out of the race \u2013 and he wants the Republican National Committee to make it happen. \u201cKasich shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. Honestly, Kasich should not be allowed to run,\u201d Trump told reporters while visiting a diner in Milwaukee, adding that Kasich takes more voters away from him than from  Cruz.\u00a0\u201cKasich shouldn\u2019t be allowed to continue, and the RNC shouldn\u2019t allow him to continue,\u201d Trump said. He\u00a0said he brought up the issue during his meeting with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus last week.\u00a0\u201cI said, \u2018Why is a guy allowed to run? All he\u2019s doing is he goes from place to place, and loses and he keeps running,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to run and take my votes. Because he\u2019s taking my votes. He\u2019s not taking Cruz\u2019s votes.\u201d Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf fired back, saying: \u201cTed Cruz also has no possibility of accumulating enough delegates and Donald Trump also will not receive a majority of delegates before the convention. Since he thinks it\u2019s such a good idea, we look forward to Trump dropping out before the convention.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the only attack on Kasich, a candidate both Trump and Cruz view as a drain on their support. Cruz\u2019s campaign is hitting\u00a0Kasich in Wisconsin with an ad accusing the Ohio governor of a conflict of interest that has benefited a company that laid off 100 workers.

            "article_content": "Trump is facing toughest challenge of his campaign He'll be tested during Tuesday's Wisconsin primary In a rollicking election season, one theme has endured: gaffes that would seriously damage any other politician leave Donald Trump unscathed. That could be changing. Trump is facing the toughest test of his campaign after a week in which he veered into a series of unexpected controversies and \u2013 for a change \u2013 seemed to struggle in his response. His parade of missteps on issues ranging from national security to abortion have left the Republican front-runner wading through his roughest patch yet on the campaign trail. Trump will learn whether he dealt his campaign serious damage on Tuesday when GOP voters in Wisconsin go to the polls. Some surveys show Texas Sen. Ted Cruz leading in the primary there and a loss for Trump would make it that much harder to secure the 1,237 delegates he\u2019ll need to secure the nomination before the GOP convention. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s been the worst week of my campaign,\u201d he told CBS News in comments that will air Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation. \u201cI think I\u2019ve had many bad weeks and I\u2019ve had many good weeks. I don\u2019t see this as the worst week in my campaign.\u201d Obama: Trump \u2018doesn\u2019t know much about foreign policy\u2019 His opponents in the party believe he has already been damaged beyond repair among the broader electorate that will decide the general election. Tim Miller, senior advisor to the Our Principles PAC, which is dedicated to opposing Trump, believes that the idea that nothing hurts Trump is a \u201cmoronic piece of conventional wisdom.\u201d \u201cHe has completely turned off huge swaths of the electorate. His numbers have continued to get worse. He would get absolutely massacred on a historic scale  (in a general election). All of the data demonstrates it.\u201d Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes The week of staggering developments seems to encapsulate the wild, unorthodox nature of much of the Trump campaign, and the election cycle he has dominated. It began on Tuesday when his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with simple battery in connection with an incident involving a female reporter. Trump\u2019s denial that his aide did anything wrong and his decision to attack Lewandowski\u2019s accuser during a CNN town hall raised new questions about his attitude towards women. During the same town hall, Trump abandoned his earlier pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee if it wasn\u2019t him. His Republican competitors, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, also backed off \u2013 reflecting the deep divisions in the party heading into the election. How Donald Trump sees himself And he shocked many foreign policy observers with comments suggesting he wants to curb nuclear proliferation while also raising the potential that Japan and South Korea develop such instruments to defend themselves. Trump set off an even more intense firestorm Wednesday \u2013 and bipartisan anger \u2013 when he suggested women who had an abortion should be punished if the procedure were outlawed. He then changed his line several times on an issue that is viewed as a deeply personal litmus test by many conservatives. On Friday, he again reversed course, telling CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that federal laws should not be changed to outlaw the procedure. Trump also struggled through a highly critical radio interview with radio host Charlie Sykes \u2013 without realizing the well-known Wisconsin conservative was a declared member of the #NeverTrump movement. Meanwhile, a flurry of news stories emerged about how Trump could harm Republicans in November, with a sudden focus on the fact that if he does not improve his standing, even the wide Republican House majority could be at risk. And Trump caused a new uproar after apparently not being familiar with delegate apportioning rules in Louisiana that could hand Cruz more delegates from the state, even though he walked away with a victory in the primary there. The sequence of events not only tests Trump\u2019s Teflon aura but also calls into question his unique method of campaigning, which relies on off-the-cuff calls from the gut, assaults on political correctness and an unusually small-scale political operation around the billionaire. Democrats plot Trump strategy to retake House Trump\u2019s defenders believe his message is so in tune with an angry electorate \u2013 and his appeal is so broad \u2013 that his liabilities could evaporate come November, especially against a Democratic candidate with her own high negatives, Hillary Clinton. \u201cWhen you get down to a fall election, and the choice is between candidate A and candidate B, then the election always looks different,\u201d Trump supporter and CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord said on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cThis kind of thing always happens.\u201d Still, The Washington Post reported this week that Trump would be the most unpopular general election candidate since the paper started polling 32 years ago. Donald Trump meets with RNC chair Reince Priebus in Washington Peter Feaver, a former senior National Security Council adviser in the George W. Bush administration, said that Trump\u2019s strength among core supporters has distracted attention away from his liabilities among a wider electorate. \u201cTrump is the first time in history that we have a candidate who has held onto his supporters so long despite making so many mistakes,\u201d said Feaver, now a professor of political science at Duke University. \u201cHe is also the first candidate in history to have been a front-runner for so long without generating any momentum among people who have not already supported him,\u201d Feaver said, pointing to the imperative for all potential nominees of widening their political support base and unifying their party behind him. \u201cThat suggests to me that Trump has been hurting himself \u2013 but in ways that are obscured by the unusual fact that they can still hold onto his base.\u201d Trump\u2019s tough week came during a lull between primary contests, which meant the narrative of the campaign has, for the first time in a while, not been dominated by his apparent march to the nomination. In that space, the focus of the media has turned to policy and what Trump would do as president. At the same time, he\u2019s facing more intense cross-examination from journalists. In the CNN town hall, moderator Anderson Cooper dismissed his claim that Ted Cruz started a spat over their wives as the argument of a five-year-old. Sykes, meanwhile, told Trump in their interview that his row with Cruz was something he would expect from \u201ca 12-year-old bully on the playground, not from somebody who wants the office held by Abraham Lincoln.\u201d And Trump\u2019s botched answer on abortion came under intense questioning from MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews. The showdowns were a taste for Trump of the intense and increased scrutiny and pressure that the billionaire would face during a general election. And as the political season slips closer toward November, Trump\u2019s prospects are coming into focus, as polls show he curtrails both potential Democratic rivals, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Trump tries to change the subject Evidence of recent polls suggests that Trump could be digging himself into a hole that might be tough to escape during a general election campaign. In the latest CNN/ORC poll in mid-March, 73% of female voters said they had a negative view of Trump and just 26% view him positively \u2013 figures that show a significant erosion from data earlier in the campaign. Those numbers also came before Trump\u2019s furious row with Cruz sparked when an unaffiliated super PAC tweeted out a picture of the billionaire\u2019s scantily clothed wife and former model Melania. Trump responded by retweeting an unflattering picture of Cruz\u2019s other half, Heidi. Crucially, Trump\u2019s standing among Republican women also seems to be eroding. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, nearly half of Republican women (47%) said they could not imagine themselves voting for Trump. That could be a danger sign for Trump in key swing state races in the fall in places like Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia, where Republican women in suburban locations could be especially crucial to his chances of being competitive. U.S. affirms Japan security backing after Trump nuclear comments As Trump reflects on the events of the last week, it\u2019s possible he may conclude that his intimate, loyal campaign operation has left him exposed. For instance, had he been better briefed, or more steeped in the issues, he likely could have avoided the firestorm on abortion. And it\u2019s possible that Trump\u2019s contradictions on foreign policy \u2014 for instance, saying he is worried about nuclear proliferation but suggesting Japan and South Korea should get nuclear weapons \u2014 could have been avoided from organized tutorials with a more robust national security team than the cadre of little-known advisers he has named. So Trump\u2019s tough week could beget an evolution of his candidacy and his political campaign tactics and team. Failing that, he will need to maintain his unusual political immunity and break the rules that prevail in general elections just as he has rewritten the structure of the GOP nominating race.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's standing in the polls appears to be worsening among women That according to a CNN analysis Donald Trump\u2019s standing in the polls appears to be worsening among women, according to a CNN analysis of recent poll data. The drop-off began even before this week\u2019s women-focused news. That included Trump\u2019s shifting views on whether a woman should face punishment for having an abortion if the procedure is banned. And defense of his campaign manager after he was accused of assaulting a female campaign reporter. Since announcing his campaign for the presidency last June, Trump has struggled to gain ground with women voters, never reaching a net-positive favorable rating among women overall and faring better among men than among women in every single state where exit or entrance polls have been conducted so far this primary season. Overall, 73% of female voters in a mid-March CNN/ORC poll said they had a negative view of Trump, just 26% view him positively. That unfavorable number is up 14 points in the last few months: from 59% in December and 67% in late February. Even Republican women, who mostly have favorable views of Trump, are more likely to report unfavorable opinions now than they were a few months ago, 39% unfavorable in March vs. 29% in December. Among men, however, there has been no such shift, with 54% holding an unfavorable view in December, 52% in February and 57% now. As of mid-March, a CNN/ORC Poll found that Republican women generally had a favorable impression of Trump and were only slightly less likely than Republican men to say they wanted Trump to win the party\u2019s nomination (50% of men backed Trump vs. 44% of women). That gap is similar to the one found in exit and entrance polls across 20 states thus far in the nomination contest. Though Trump has carried women\u2019s votes in many of them, on average, Trump\u2019s support among men outpaces that among women by 7 points. RELATED: Donald Trump meets with RNC chair Reince Priebus in Washington But those fairly small differences between Republican men and Republican women mask Trump\u2019s larger image issues with women voters overall. Trump\u2019s favorability rating among women voters generally is the worst out of all the remaining major party presidential candidates, and is on the decline. Beyond that, in hypothetical general election matchups, Trump trails Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton among women by a significantly larger margin than the other remaining Republican candidates. Matched up against Clinton in a hypothetical general election matchup, 60% of women voters say they would back Clinton, 33% Trump. That compares with a 50% Trump to 45% Clinton split among men. Both Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz fare much better among women against Clinton than Trump, with Kasich trailing Clinton by 7 and Cruz down 15 points. Those Kasich and Cruz margins are more in line with GOP presidential performance among women voters in recent elections. CNN exit polls showed women broke for Obama over Romney by 11 points in 2012, and in Obama\u2019s favor over McCain by 13 points in 2008. George W. Bush\u2019s 48% support among women marked the best showing by a Republican candidate among women since his father notched 50% in 1988. And few women voters in the poll see Trump as particularly empathetic to their concerns. Asked whether Trump or Clinton \u201cagrees with you on the issues that matter most to you,\u201d 57% of female voters choose Clinton, 32% Trump and 11% say neither. Among Republican women, most choose Trump, 73%, but a whopping 17% say neither Trump nor Clinton agrees with them on their top issues. Just 4% of Democratic women say the same on that question. RELATED: Why Trump\u2019s abortion comments scare Republicans Women voters generally and Republican women in particular are more likely than men to say that Trump is more apt than Clinton to change his positions for political reasons. Overall, 48% of women say Trump is more likely than Clinton to change his views for political reasons, while 37% of men choose Trump. Among Republican women, 35% name Trump vs. 21% of Republican men. And while about 4 in 10 Republican men and Republican women say they would be enthusiastic if Trump won the Party\u2019s nomination, Republican women are nearly three times as likely as GOP men (31% to 13% among men) to say they would be upset if he prevailed in the end. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone March 17-20 among 1,001 randomly selected adult Americans, including 925 registered voters. The results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, it is 4.5 points for results among women voters overall and 7 points for results among Republican women voters.",

His campaign scrambled to clean up the statement later in the day, saying that women who obtain abortions are victims and that doctors who perform the service are the ones who should be punished.

After disavowing Trump\u2019s statements, Sanders then questioned why the mogul\u2019s comments were dominating the political conversation. \u201cBecause media is what media is today, any stupid, absurd remark made by Donald Trump becomes the story of the week,\u201d Sanders told MSNBC. \u201cMaybe, just maybe, we might want to have a serious discussion about the serious issues facing America.\u201d Sanders then went on to say that Trump\u2019s other positions \u2013 on issues like climate change, the economy and wealth \u2013 should also be talked about. \u201cIf we don\u2019t discuss those issues, it creates the climate for people like Donald Trump to do much better than he really has a right to do,\u201d Sanders concluded. Clinton on Thursday took issue with the idea that abortion does not rise to a comparable level of importance. \u201cThis is a fundamental, constitutional right and we cannot think it is anything other but really serious,\u201d said the former secretary of state. Michael Briggs, Sanders\u2019 spokesman, responded to Clinton on Thursday by turning fire back against Trump, sidestepping her claim. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s statement about punishing women who have abortions is an outrage,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cIt is unbelievable that a candidate for president would make such an absurd statement. Sen. Sanders has a 100 percent lifetime voting record defending a woman\u2019s right to choose and will do all that he can to protect and expand that right if elected president.\u201d Clinton, speaking at the same school where she launched her 2000 Senate bid when she was first lady, was clearly very animated in challenging Sanders, whose campaign has said he will fight hard to win New York\u2019s primary on April 19. \u201cI\u2019m telling you people \u2013 we actually have to do something, not just complain,\u201d Clinton said, a subtle knock on Sanders. She added later that in the Senate, she was \u201cmore interested in solving a problem than making a point.\u201d Shortly into Clinton\u2019s speech, a small group of protesters stood up and yelled, \u201cIf she wins, we lose.\u201d Clinton looked at them and said, \u201cOh, I know. Bernie people came to say that.\u201d \u201cI have earned 9 million votes in this election. I have 1 million more votes than Donald Trump and I have 2.5 million more votes than Senator Sanders,\u201d Clinton said to cheers as the protesters were escorted out. In a nod, however, to the fact that she will need Sanders\u2019 supporters if she wins the Democratic nomination, Clinton closed her riff by urging unity. \u201cWe have got to unite,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWhen this primary contest is over, we have to unite and make sure we have a Democrat in the White House.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump said that women who get abortions should face \"some form of punishment\" if the practice is banned Clinton quickly linked Trump with other GOP candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that women who get abortions should face \u201csome form of punishment\u201d if the practice is banned is giving the #NeverTrump movement new urgency. Donald Trump: Abortion is a very serious problem Faced with the prospect of Trump as the party\u2019s standard bearer, Republicans from across the ideological spectrum quickly condemned Trump\u2019s assertion \u2013 but not before Democrats showed the damage Trump\u2019s words could have on the GOP. And in what was a clear acknowledgment of the stakes, Trump did something he has rarely done in this campaign \u2013 back away from his statement within hours. His comments, which go against the GOP\u2019s anti-abortion stance, brought new potency to the anti-Trump wing of the party, including conservative radio hosts and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, looking to stop Trump in next week\u2019s primary. Trump was already facing a media uproar this week over his comments about Heidi Cruz and over his handling of an incident involving his campaign manager and a female reporter that led to an arrest summons. Of course, Trump has shown himself to be an unstoppable force who has offended pretty much everyone at this point without much harm to his poll numbers. But for Republicans worried about the damage Trump could do at the top of the ticket with off-the-cuff or controversial quotes, Democrats, including presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, gave a harsh reminder. \u201cThe Republicans all line up together,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cNow maybe they aren\u2019t quite as open about it as Donald Trump was earlier today, but they all have the same position,\u201d she said, noting anti-abortion positions taken by both John Kasich and Ted Cruz. \u201cIf you make abortion a crime \u2013 you make it illegal \u2013 then you make women and doctors criminals.\u201d Clinton slams Trump abortion comments Clinton: Trump's comments on abortion 'unacceptable' Wednesday\u2019s controversy unfolded less than a week before the April 5 Wisconsin primary, which will serve as a crucial test for the remaining GOP candidates before the race returns east. A new Marquette University Law School poll shows Cruz topping the field with 40% and Trump at 30%, with Kasich at 21%.  The poll was conducted March 24-28 before Trump\u2019s statements about abortion and the arrest of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, yet happened after Trump targeted Heidi Cruz. Cruz also leads among women, besting Trump 39% to 24%. Conservative female pundits want Donald Trump to fire his campaign manager In 2012, Democrats linked GOP Senate candidates Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock to the entire Republican Party \u2014 with devastating effect \u2013 after they both made controversial remarks about rape and abortion. Liberal groups were quick to do the same with Trump\u2019s. Trump campaign: 11 outrageous quotes Emily\u2019s List, a group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights, sent out a press release called  The Comstock-Trump Agenda: Criminalizing Abortion Edition. It targeted Rep. Barbara Comstock, who is running for re-election in Virginia, a swing state. \u201cDonald Trump is leading the GOP charge to prevent women from making their own health care decisions, and Barbara Comstock is standing right beside him,\u201d said Emily\u2019s List press secretary Rachel Thomas. Why I\u2019m voting for Donald TrumpBy suggesting that women who get an abortion should face punishment, Trump managed to unite advocates on both sides of the issue. Abortion opponents have pushed for punishment for doctors who perform abortions, but not women who receive them. That Trump struggled with this issue \u2013 a core holding of these advocates \u2014 underscored for some that he is new to the conservative fight, an argument that his opponents have been making for some time to little effect. Asked Wednesday by MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews whether a woman who got an abortion illegally should face punishment, the current GOP front-runner said he supported that idea. Ben Carson defends Donald Trump's abortion answer \u201cYes, there has to be some form of punishment,\u201dTrump said, adding that he didn\u2019t know what form of punishment would be acceptable. He also said that men involved in an unwanted pregnancy that led to an abortion would not face any type of punishment. Ben Carson defends Donald Trump\u2019s abortion answer Cruz, who has aired ads showing Trump in a 1999 interview declaring himself \u201cpro-choice,\u201d said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cwrong\u201d and that it showed the billionaire isn\u2019t up to the task to lead. \u201cIt\u2019s the latest demonstration of how little Donald has thought about any of the serious issues facing this country,\u201d Cruz said after taping an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d Wednesday night. \u201cI am pro-life. Being pro-life means standing and defending the unborn,\u201d Cruz added. \u201cBut it also means defending moms. Defending women. And defending the incredible gift women have to bring life into the world. And Donald\u2019s comments, they were unfortunate, they were wrong and I strongly disagree with it.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s 3 positions on abortion in 3 hours The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List framed Trump as a candidate who is new to the issue. \u201cAs a convert to the pro-life movement, Mr. Trump sees the reality of the horror of abortion \u2013 the destruction of an innocent human life \u2013 which is legal in our country up until the moment of birth,\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the group, said in a statement. \u201cBut let us be clear: punishment is solely for the abortionist who profits off of the destruction of one life and the grave wounding of another.\u201d About three hours after he spoke to MSNBC, Trump reversed course, issuing a statement saying that his pro-life \u201cposition has not changed.\u201d \u201cIf Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb.\u201d That didn\u2019t mollify opponents who have seen him as a fake conservative who has been a no-show on the big conservative fights. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up \u201cWhile Trump has since \u2018clarified\u2019 this position on punishing women, his statements suggest he should spend more time with pro-life conservatives to gain a better appreciation of what their goals and objectives really are,\u201d said Tony Perkins, Family Research Council Action president and Ted Cruz backer. \u201cThe pro-life movement values both mother and child and seeks to uphold the dignity of both by seeking to protect both from the damage of abortion and the predatory abortion industry.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Vice President Joe Biden called on Senate Republicans on Thursday to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland \"There is no 'Biden rule,'\" he said In his strongest and most passionate comments to date, Vice President Joe Biden called on Senate Republicans on Thursday to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy left by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia and not \u201cabdicate their responsibility.\u201d He expressed concern about a \u201cgenuine constitutional crisis\u201d that he said would be born out of the \u201cdysfunction of Washington.\u201d Biden warned about the perils of allowing important decisions to remain in \u201climbo\u201d if an evenly divided court was unable to set a nationwide precedent in major cases. He said the effect of keeping a seat vacant for what could be hundreds of days could fracture the country. \u201cThe framers designed our system to give one Supreme Court the responsibility of resolving conflicts in the lower courts,\u201d he said and added that if those conflicts are allowed to stand \u201cwe end up with a patchwork Constitution.\u201d Biden reiterated the impact of the court\u2019s work on everyday Americans, on issues such as race discrimination, separation of church and state, abortion and police searches. \u201cLook at the cases,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cthe American people deserve a fully staffed Supreme Court of nine. \u201c \u201cThe longer this high court vacancy remains unfilled, the more serious the problem we will face \u2013 a problem compounded by turbulence, confusion, and uncertainty about our safety and security, our liberty and privacy, the future of our children and grandchildren,\u201d Biden said. And he noted he was fearful that the current gridlock in Congress would infect the high court. \u201cDysfunction and partisanship are bad enough on Capitol Hill,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let the Senate spread that dysfunction to another branch of government \u2013 to the Supreme Court of the United States. We must not let it fester.\u201d In his remarks, Biden sought to push back at Republican critics who are using his comments from a 1992 floor speech as ammunition to argue that he too once stressed the need for delaying confirmation hearings until after the political campaign season was over. At the time, Biden was discussing a hypothetical vacancy and said the president \u2013 who was then George H.W. Bush \u2013 should \u201cnot name a nominee until after the November election is completed.\u201d Supporters of Biden point to the fact that later in the same speech the then-Senate Judiciary Committee chairman pledged to consider a nominee \u201cif the President consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selection absent consultation.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s remarks Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years and spent nearly half that time as chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said that during his tenure, every nominee got a committee hearing. \u201cThere is no \u2018Biden rule.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. Before the speech was delivered, a spokesman for Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, Don Stewart, dismissed the remarks as an attempt on the part of Biden to \u201cclean up\u201d past remarks that he had made by \u201cclaiming he didn\u2019t really say what he said.\u201d McConnell has declined to meet with Garland although he called the judge the day his nomination was announced to wish him well and tell him personally that the Senate would not act. On CNN\u2019s State of the Union McConnell said, \u201cThis nomination ought to be made by the president we\u2019re in the process of electing this year.\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley similarly said Biden\u2019s comments are a case of hypocrisy. In a statement the Iowa Republican said that Biden as chairman had failed to consider 44 judicial nominations. \u201cNo matter how hard the White House tries to rewrite history, it can\u2019t change then Chairmen Biden\u2019s remarks explaining how the President and Senate should handle a Supreme Court nomination arising during a heated presidential campaign,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cAs Chairman Biden explained, the hyper-political environment is bad for the nominee, the court, and ultimately the nation.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments about the dysfunction of Congress echoed what Chief Justice John Roberts said three years ago during a talk at the University of Nebraska. Speaking of the other two branches of government, Roberts said, \u201cIt\u2019s a period of real partisan rancor that I think impedes their ability to carry out their functions, and I don\u2019t want it to spill over and affect us.\u201d More recently, in comments made before Scalia\u2019s death, Roberts was asked about the confirmation process during a talk at New England Law School in Boston. He said that he didn\u2019t think it was \u201cfunctioning very well.\u201d He noted that when Justice Scalia and Ginsburg were confirmed the votes were unanimous or nearly so, but in recent years the votes for Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito have been closer to party lines. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThat suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees.\u201d The court has already released one 4-4 opinion in a case concerning the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. When the court is evenly divided, the lower court opinion is affirmed but no national precedent is set. On Wednesday the court appeared to be closely divided in a much higher profile case concerning a challenge \u2013 brought by non profit religiously affiliated groups \u2013 to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that insurance plan provide a full range of contraceptive coverage. If it turns out that the court splits 4-4 in that case, the opinion could cause confusion across the country where lower courts are split on the issue. So far eight appellate courts have ruled in favor of the president, while one, the 8th Circuit, has ruled in favor of the challengers. But conservative activists said the vice president\u2019s concerns about 4-4 decisions are misplaced, considering his actions in the Senate when roles were reversed. \u201cIt was unfortunate and embarrassing to see Vice President Biden try to strike fear in Americans about how a temporarily divided 4-4 Court could threaten their freedom of speech and religion, particularly when Biden himself has stated that the costs of a divided Court are actually \u2018quite minor,\u2019\u201d said Brian Rogers, executive director of America Rising Squared. Supreme Court hears challenge to Obamacare contraceptive mandate CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump reacted to the news Obama is nominating his pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia \"I think the next president should make the pick,\" Trump said The ramifications of President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to announce a Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia quickly spilled over onto the 2016 campaign trail with both sides weighing in Wednesday. \u201cI think the next president should make the pick. And I think they shouldn\u2019t go forward. And I believe I\u2019m pretty much in line with what the Republicans are saying,\u201d GOP front-runner Donald Trump told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo Wednesday on \u201cNew Day,\u201d just hours before Obama nominated D.C. Court of Appeals Judge Merrick Garland. But Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, said that the Senate Republicans should take up Garland\u2019s nomination and noted the Senate had never taken more than 125 days to vote on a nominee. \u201cEvaluating and confirming a Justice to sit on this nation\u2019s highest court should not be an exercise in political brinkmanship and partisan posturing,\u201d Clinton said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cIt is a serious obligation, performed on behalf of the American people, to ensure a highly qualified candidate fills a vacancy on the Court. That obligation does not depend on the party affiliation of a sitting president, nor does the Constitution make an exception to that duty in an election year.\u201d Obama announced Wednesday he was nominating Garland to fill the vacancy created by Scalia\u2019s death last month. Obama pressed his case that his pick should at least be given a hearing during his speech announcing his pick. \u201cTo suggest that someone as qualified and respected as Merrick Garland doesn\u2019t even deserve a hearing, let alone an up or down vote, to join an institution as important as our Supreme Court, when two- thirds of Americans believe otherwise, that would be unprecedented. To suggest that someone who has served his country with honor and dignity, with a distinguished track record of delivering justice for the American people might be treated, as one Republican leader stated, as a political pinata. That can\u2019t be right,\u201d Obama said. RELATED: Obama nominates Merrick Garland to Supreme Court Two senators left in the race, who will be directly involved in the debate, split on their opinions of Garland. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, got in a shot at Trump in the process. He blasted Garland as a \u201cso-called \u2018moderate\u2019 Democrat nominee (that) is precisely the kind of deal that Donald Trump has told us he would make \u2013 someone who would rule along with other liberals on the bench like Justices (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg and (Sonia) Sotomayor. Make no mistake, if Garland were confirmed, he would side predictably with President Obama on critical issues such as undermining the Second Amendment, legalizing partial-birth abortion, and propping up overreaching bureaucratic agencies like the EPA and the IRS.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, called on Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold nomination hearings for Garland. \u201cRefusing to hold hearings on the president\u2019s nominee would be unprecedented,\u201d Sanders said Wednesday, in a statement from his Senate office. \u201cPresident Obama has done his job. It\u2019s time for Republicans to do theirs. I call on Sen. Grassley to hold confirmation hearings immediately and for Leader McConnell to bring the nomination to floor of the Senate if Judge Garland is approved by the Judiciary Committee.\u201d Before Obama\u2019s pick was known \u2013 indeed, nearly as soon as Scalia had died \u2013 Republicans expressed staunch refusal to consider Obama\u2019s nominee, insisting that his replacement make a determination on who would fill the vacant seat. \u201cI think that the next president should make the pick. We don\u2019t have a very long distance to wait. Certainly they could wait it out very easily,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cI would be not in favor of going forward.\u201d \u201cNo matter what? What if he picks your sister,\u201d Cuomo asked, referring to Maryanne Trump Barry, a senior judge the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. \u201cThen I would say the same thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy sister\u2019s very happy where she is. She\u2019s doing a great job. She\u2019s considered a brilliant person and she is.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Major donor gave $10 million to pro-Ted Cruz super PAC, but it's not airing ads Toby Neugebauer has discussed pulling his money, sources say \"We've all come to grips with the fact that it's never going to get spent\" Ted Cruz is struggling to unite the Republican Party\u2019s anti-Donald Trump vote and needs every dollar he can get. So why is the backer behind a $10 million super PAC last year not spending any money with no ad buys in sight? That\u2019s the question Cruz allies are asking ahead of \u201cSuper Tuesday 3\u201d and critical votes in five states that could determine whether or not Republicans have a chance of defeating front-runner Trump. Almost one year after Keep the Promise II was founded with a $10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer, an energy investor and son of a Texas Republican congressman, the group he controls still retains almost all of its funds. Questions about the group\u2019s intentions, once whispered and optimistically explained away, are growing. Neugebauer previously said his group would spend its cash on TV ads in February and March, but it has not done so. He told CNN he is prepared to invest his money in winner-take-all states deeper into the calendar, but declined to be more specific and did not commit to spending the full $10 million he donated. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I have done. I think I\u2019ve been a good steward of capital,\u201d he said. But according to two individuals close to Cruz\u2019s constellation of super PACs, he has discussed the possibility about withdrawing his cash \u2013 which while legal, is highly unusual. Officials in the other Keep the Promise groups are no longer banking on Neugebauer and planning budgets as if his money does not exist, five people close to the super PACs told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m just mystified, to be honest,\u201d said Lee Hanley, a wealthy donor who hosted Neugebauer and Cruz\u2019s inner circle in 2014 when they plotted Cruz\u2019s presidential strategy. Hanley\u2019s wife is the treasurer of the new committee and communicates frequently with Neugebauer. Hanley said he confronted Neugebauer last December at a philanthropic event in Palm Beach, Florida about his lack of spending, the Texan brushed the concern off. \u201cIf Ted were to lose by one vote \u2013 and that was Toby\u2019s vote,\u201d Hanley said, \u201cI think Toby would have great regret for the rest of his life.\u201d Neugebauer is a close friend of Cruz and the architect of the Keep the Promise fundraising network, which gave Cruz immediate viability when they announced they had raised $36 million in the opening weeks of his presidential campaign. And despite being described by people close to Cruz\u2019s campaign as disorganized and high-intensity, Neugebauer is praised by all corners for his ability to raise the initial money that gave Cruz a crush of earned media and paved the path for him to be a top presidential candidate today. The Cruz campaign is barred from coordinating with the super PACs and did not respond to a request for comment. Neugebauer has been highly skeptical of the effectiveness of large, negative advertising buys this cycle. He scrapped a long-planned advertising campaign in South Carolina last fall, and then later declined to work with other Cruz groups for an ad buy there last month that the groups hoped would prevent his disappointing finish there, according to three people familiar with the discussions. He did make a big offer earlier this year. During the Iowa caucuses, he and another family offered a total of $1.5 million to a charity of Trump\u2019s choosing if Trump agreed to a one-on-one debate with Cruz. Trump declined. Neugebauer said any conversations about pulling the cash have always been in hypothetical in nature. \u201cI sincerely put the money in, and I am sincerely actively looking for ways to invest the money,\u201d he said. \u201cI always thought that was a long road, and my deal with Ted to White House was a $10 million donation.\u201d Asked directly if he would withdraw the donation, he said, \u201cWhat if Ted loses every state the next two weeks and the election\u2019s over? I\u2019m in it until Ted is either the president of the United States \u2013 or no longer viable.\u201d Questions about the Cruz outside groups are peaking because of a major organizational revamp announced last week. The Keep the Promise groups instituted a structure called Trusted Leadership PAC designed to move away from having four separate groups dominated by different donors, who have frequently clashed amid competing priorities. Conspicuously absent from the new committee was Keep the Promise II, a decision that is intensifying the anger directed toward Neugebauer. \u201cToby\u2019s a persona non grata,\u201d said one super PAC official, who requested anonymity to protect a sensitive relationship with someone they work with closely. \u201cWe\u2019ve all come to grips with the fact that it\u2019s never going to get spent.\u201d Hard-charging, mercurial and a big-game hunter whose family grew close to that of Ted and Heidi Cruz, Neugebauer moved from his Houston post to raise his children in Puerto Rico a few years ago. He became a known quantity in the Texas Republican money world, raising money for Rick Perry in 2012 and being tasked in the lead-up to Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign to organize the big-money network that would support him independently. Three of the super PACs were set up so that three families, including Neugebauer\u2019s, could have complete control over their group\u2019s spending, an arrangement at the time hailed as innovative by some and foolhardy by others. It also made it easier for a donor to not spend cash at all. Keep the Promise I is funded by New York hedge funder Bob Mercer. It has spent nearly $11 million on pro-Cruz television and radio advertising, and just began a new wave of fundraising. Keep the Promise III, financed by two brothers made rich by Texas oil and helmed by a group of digital organizers active in the anti-abortion movement, has spent half of its seed money on things like Facebook ads targeted finely in early-voting states. And Keep the Promise PAC, a group set up to win over the donors not from those families, ran a well-regarded field program in states like Iowa, lining the state with more yard signs than did the official campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Everyone wants to be the head chef,\u201d Neugebauer said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t need a retired chef.\u201d The group\u2019s only expenditures reported to the Federal Election Commission are a $570,000 payout for the shared data analytics program that undergirds the super PACs\u2019 work and production costs for a fall 2015 advertising buy that CNN has reported was canceled at the last-minute. Neugebauer said new election reports will show that he had spent a total of $1 million \u2013 or 10% of the cash in his war chest. Sources in Cruz World say Neugebauer does not participate in daily strategy calls. Group officials hear from him as much in press stories as they do in person. A business associated with him gave to a splinter pro-Cruz super PAC network through a limited liability company. Neugebauer said he does indeed talk with all the principal players privately, and remains in close contact on strategic decisions, including multiple conversations just this week. Cruz allies say the stakes for Neugebauer grow more the longer he waits. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you miss an email that would\u2019ve taken a three-word response. A week later, and now your response needs to be a little longer,\u201d said one person close to the groups. \u201cA little while longer, and now it takes a phone call.\u201d \u201cNow he\u2019s waited this long and he\u2019s got to do something huge,\u201d the person continued. \u201cHe\u2019s now waiting for the perfect pitch \u2013 and it\u2019s just never going to come.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton's allies are already compiling a record of Trump's crass comments and positions on women's issues They're laying the groundwork for a potential general election battle against Clinton When Donald Trump makes a bimbo reference or a recording emerges of the GOP front-runner critiquing women\u2019s physical appearances, Democrats add it to the arsenal. \u201cThe most motivating thing for women voters would be to have Donald Trump as the nominee,\u201d said Marcy Stech, the communications director for EMILY\u2019s List, a Democratic political committee that supports pro-abortion rights women running for public office. Hillary Clinton\u2019s allies are already compiling a record of Trump\u2019s crass comments and positions on women\u2019s issues, laying the groundwork for a potential general election battle against Clinton. Her backers believe using Trump\u2019s own words against him \u2013 not only about women, but also Muslims and Hispanics \u2013 may prove to be one of their most powerful weapons. Their options are hardly limited. Over the years Trump has been a frequent guest on The Howard Stern Show \u2013 comments that found renewed attention after BuzzFeed unearthed them. Over the years, Trump has ranked women\u2019s appearances on a scale of 1 to 10, once saying \u201ca person who is flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.\u201d He\u2019s also delved into his own sexual preferences and even bragged about women who flirted with him, saying \u201cThey\u2019ll walk up and they\u2019ll flip their top, and they\u2019ll flip their panties.\u201d All of that came before Trump was a presidential candidate, and he brushed the remarks aside in an interview with CNN. \u201cWe had a lot of fun on the show,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was never a politician, and we just had fun on the show. And it\u2019s all clean \u2013 it\u2019s all clean. It\u2019s none of this disgusting stuff, that I can tell you.\u201d But on the campaign trail, Trump has had another crop of cringe-worthy moments. There was the time Trump went to war with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly after she questioned him in a debate about his history of sexist comments. In the aftermath, Trump made a crude reference to her menstrual cycle on CNN, saying, \u201cshe starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions and, you know, you can see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood out of her wherever.\u201d Trump later insisted he was talking about Kelly\u2019s nose. He also criticized Carly Fiorina\u2019s appearance when she was running for president. \u201cLook at that face!\u201d Trump said as Fiorina appeared on television, according to a Rolling Stone profile. \u201cWould anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d Trump later said he was referring to Fiorina\u2019s persona, not her appearance. While Clinton has struggled this cycle to solidify her base of female supporters, particularly younger women, her allies believe running against Trump could energize this key general election voting bloc to rally behind Clinton. \u201cI think Trump will be unelectable to a large swath of female voters,\u201d said Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist and political commentator for CNN. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to have moms who don\u2019t like the role model for their children. I think you\u2019re going to have unmarried women who see this as belittling and patronizing. I think women are going to coalesce around Hillary on this issue.\u201d Clinton boosters said there\u2019s plenty more to use against Trump \u2013 from video tapes to lawsuits and depositions \u2013 that haven\u2019t yet come to light in the GOP primary. A Trump nomination \u201chas the opportunity and potential to break open an entire part of the electorate,\u201d Stech said. And that doesn\u2019t apply solely to women who are Democrats or independents, she added. \u201cI think that there are a lot of women who are Republicans, who find themselves identifying with Republican policies, who would not vote or vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Stech said. But Democrats are also wary of the difficulty of pinning any negative storyline to the billionaire businessman. They\u2019ve seen how little success Republicans have had in damaging him so far. For Trump\u2019s part, he\u2019s begun to highlight his wife, Melania, and his daughter, Ivanka, to help soften his edges. He\u2019s also been touting stances that might make him more palatable to female voters. Even though Trump has vowed to defund Planned Parenthood if it continues to offer abortions, he has also lauded the women\u2019s health services Planned Parenthood provides. \u201cMillions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,\u201d Trump said in a recent press conference. \u201cI\u2019m going to be really good for women. I\u2019m going to be really good for women\u2019s health issues.\u201d Trump even acknowledged, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s not a perfect conservative view.\u201d Clinton, meanwhile, appears to relish the idea of facing off against Trump. \u201cMr. Trump insults and dismisses women. He\u2019s been throwing a lot of heat my way,\u201d Clinton said at a Women for Hillary kickoff event last year in New Hampshire. \u201cHe said he would do a much better job for women than I would. Now that\u2019s a general election debate that\u2019s going to be a lot of fun.\u201d In what\u2019s beginning to look like a general election preview, earlier this year Trump and Clinton traded charges of sexism. Trump responded by telling CNN that Clinton was an \u201cenabler\u201d for former President Bill Clinton\u2019s past infidelities and accusations of sexual misconduct. Asked whether he was concerned that Clinton might use his history of inflammatory comments about women against him, Trump opted for a different approach in a recent interview with CNN. Rather than referencing her husband, Trump \u2013 who regularly hammers Clinton over the controversy surrounding her email server \u2013 aimed a broadside at Clinton\u2019s electability. \u201cShe\u2019s got enough problems,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to worry about me. She shouldn\u2019t even be allowed to run.\u201d",

After not making any advertising buys on local, national, cable, broadcast or radio as of Thursday morning, Trump\u2019s campaign bought $1.6 million in six states \u2013 Texas, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Virginia and Arkansas \u2013 on Thursday afternoon, according to data provided by CMAG/Kantar Media. The biggest purchase is in Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas, where he reserved $470,000 of time. Trump largely resisted investing in advertising until the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses, resting on his command of free media. He did eventually spend almost $10 million in the first four primary and caucus states, however. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment about its advertising plans. Advertising is becoming more critical as the race enters a phase with multiple contests on the same date, making it impossible for candidates to invest as much in retail politics as they did in Iowa and New Hampshire. And for now, Cruz and Rubio have the upper hand, according to the data. Rubio and his allies are spending $3.9 million this week, almost all of which is coming from his super PAC. That group has made a particularly large investment in Texas, where it has invested over $1.2 million. One of Cruz\u2019s super PACs, Keep the Promise I, on Thursday will make an advertising buy in excess of $1 million, the group\u2019s president, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN. A competing pro-Cruz super PAC is already spending $850,000 to back him in Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Georgia. Those buys, combined with the Cruz campaign\u2019s $2.9 million in purchases, will send the total pro-Cruz tally as of Thursday afternoon to over $5 million this week before Super Tuesday, a date Cruz has called \u201cthe single most important day in this presidential election.\u201d Cruz has begun a new ad in the South targeting the conservative base that replay some of Trump\u2019s older interviews, including ones in which Trump praises abortion rights and Hillary Clinton. \u201cArkansas cannot trust Donald Trump,\u201d one spot in the Jonesboro, Arkansas, media market goes. \u201cDon\u2019t give him that chance.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rural voters could decide Nevada contest An organized Clinton has learned from mistakes of 2008 Both Sanders and Clinton are well-organized in rural Nevada Eureka, Nevada \u2013 Nevada Democrats live few and far between on the loneliest road in America. But these rural voters may once again be the pivotal force in this fierce contest for the Democratic nomination. Polling doesn\u2019t tell you much in Nevada, because it is so difficult to predict who will turn out to caucus. So we set out to gauge the strength and energy of the operations for Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders by finding Democratic voters in these sparsely populated counties over a three-day journey along the loneliest road. Life Magazine gave U.S. Route 50 that designation in 1986, warning travelers that Nevada\u2019s stretch of the transcontinental highway (once the route of the Pony Express) offered travelers \u201cneither services nor anything to do along the way.\u201d But Nevada legislators saw an opportunity to bring tourists to this spectacular two-lane highway that traverses salt flats and sand dunes, high desert plains covered with spiny hopsage and sage brush, pi\u00f1on forests and half-abandoned mining towns. It covers the vast expanse of the Great Basin and snow-capped peaks seem to tower above the road at every turn. Officially designating the loneliest road in 1987, tourism officials even created a passport for travelers to gather stamps along the way \u2013 the reward being a \u201cHighway 50 Survivors Certificate\u201d for those who traveled the desolate 257 miles of the route between Fallon and Ely. Republicans far outnumber Democrats in the counties along the route: There are just 2,747 Democrats to 7,360 Republicans in Churchill County, for example, and a mere 112 Democrats compared to 620 Republicans in Eureka County. But in this election year, these few Democrats are anything but forgotten. Clinton learned her lesson in the rural counties eight years ago when Barack Obama swept in to the Silver State with a superior ground game. Though she won the popular vote, Obama bested her by claiming more nominating delegates to the Democratic National Convention, largely on the strength of his performance in Nevada\u2019s rural counties. In an echo of 2008, Clinton is running into a wall of momentum from another upstart challenger, Sanders. And this time, Clinton\u2019s campaign took no chances. Though they are relying on a sizable turnout of her supporters in the Latino-heavy precincts of Clark County around Las Vegas, they began getting to know the voters in the rural areas of Nevada as early as last summer. \u201cThey had their organizers come through here and they hosted every Democrat they could find for lunch downtown at one of our local restaurants,\u201d said Sam Hanson, the Democratic Party Chairman of White Pine County, which has 1,376 Democrats, according to January figures from the Nevada Secretary of State. \u201cThey are very well-organized here.\u201d But Sanders\u2019 volunteers and organizers have fanned out across the state, demonstrating a forceful presence even in the farthest reaches of Nevada on the eve of the caucuses. The two candidates were effectively tied in the latest CNN/ORC poll of likely caucus-goers. Precinct captains and Democratic voters along the way predicted a higher-than-expected turnout\u2014which would favor the Vermont senator\u2014in part because they say many students and first-time caucus-goers in their towns are showing up at organizing meetings on behalf of Sanders. Tim Stevenson, who has been canvassing for Sanders as many as five days a week around Carson City\u2014near the starting point of Nevada\u2019s stretch of the \u201cloneliest road\u201d heading east\u2014described the 2016 Democratic contest as \u201ca real watershed moment\u201d as he stood at the doorstep of a potential caucus-goer in Jacks Valley earlier this week. \u201cIt is so important that we start this change,\u201d he said as he made his pitch for Sanders. Stevenson, a 62-year-old artist who said he has never canvassed for another presidential candidate, said he got involved this year \u201cbecause this is the first time in my life when there\u2019s an actual progressive candidate that has ideas that are going to change our government that has been functioning for the corporate elite.\u201d He added that it\u2019s the first time that a candidate like that \u201chas ever really had a real probable chance of gaining the presidency.\u201d If Sanders becomes president, Stevenson said, \u201cIt will be because voters will come out who have not been voting. There\u2019s a whole bunch of people who have lost their credence that government is doing anything for them.\u201d Beyond Sanders\u2019 mantle as a movement candidate, Clinton is also is facing a backlash from rural Democratic voters who view her as too liberal on guns. During the debates, Clinton has hammered Sanders as too moderate on gun control, but that has worked against her here. Ree Taylor, a fourth-generation Nevadan from Eureka who caucused for Obama in 2008, said she favors Sanders because she worries about Clinton\u2019s advocacy for more stringent gun control measures \u2014 a common refrain among Democrats in Nevada\u2019s rural areas. \u201cHillary would be O.K.,\u201d Taylor said during an interview this week at the Eureka Sentinel Museum, where she works. She said she likes Clinton\u2019s stance on abortion issues, \u201cbut her gun control (stance) \u2014 it\u2019s just a little more than I would like.\u201d \u201cIt seems like they just want everyone to register their guns and whatnot \u2014 and nobody to have a gun except law enforcement,\u201d said Taylor, who said she worries about being able to give her daughters the guns that belonged to their grandfathers and great grandfathers. Taylor said she believes Sanders\u2019 more moderate record on gun control will help him in Nevada. But Clinton\u2019s supporters in these rural counties have been working hard to correct what they view as the mistaken impression that she wants to take away guns. In Elko earlier this week, a supporter who has been canvassing for Clinton told the candidate that she was continually encountering questions about whether Clinton supports the Second Amendment. \u201cI want you tell your friends and neighbors, I believe with all my heart we can have common-sense gun reform measures that are consistent with the Second Amendment. It\u2019s important for people to understand that and hear that,\u201d Clinton told her supporter during the event in Elko. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the Brady Bill since \u201994. I want you to find one person who\u2019s had their gun taken away. Just find one for me. \u2026 There is a difference between respecting gun owners and gun owners\u2019 constitutional rights to hunt, to collect, to shoot, and going along with the agenda of the gun lobby which represents the gun makers more than they represent the gun owners. And what we have seen in the last few years is a concerted effort to mislead, misinform gun owners by the gun lobby.\u201d Hanson, a 61-year-old high school teacher from Ely, Nevada, who will caucus for Clinton Saturday, said her backers have been driving her argument that Sanders\u2019 proposals are unfeasible and expensive. \u201cHillary is rallying right now throughout the state,\u201d said Hanson. \u201cI think one of the demographics that\u2019s driving her popularity here are people of my age group\u2026. We are looking at stability. Period.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re looking at somebody who has the experience to be able to work, to reach across the aisle,\u201d he said. \u201cBernie has done a few things with Republicans over the years, but you look at all the things that Hillary has done over the years \u2013 and Bill.\u201d \u201cWe have some serious problems in this country, and I see Hillary offering real solutions to those problems,\u201d Hanson said. Sanders\u2019 agenda, he said, is \u201cbeautiful to look at. It\u2019s wonderful. But it\u2019s just not going to happen in the present political climate, or even probably in my life time\u2014and I\u2019m going to live to be 100.\u201d Most of the people that we met along the loneliest road were backers of Donald Trump \u2013 in a state George W. Bush won twice before Obama notched two victories. Despite the Silver State\u2019s increasingly blue tinge, with its burgeoning Latino population in the South, Trump clearly has a powerful hold on the voters who live in these far reaches of Nevada. They want their voices heard, and that could foreshadow a tougher-than-expected fight in November.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama will start reading through extensive packets of information about potential Supreme Court nominees this weekend The information includes details of their professional careers, records and experience President Barack Obama has remained tight-lipped on his strategy for overcoming an intransigent Congress and seeing his Supreme Court nominee confirmed, but his aides and allies have already begun describing in broad contours what they\u2019re looking for in a candidate. The job listing includes some specific requirements on employment history: Vice President Joe Biden has made known in the past several days that candidates who have been confirmed for their current posts with votes from Republicans stand a better chance of being elevated by the Senate onto the court. The White House has said little about who Obama is eyeing as his makes the high-stakes pick. Asked Tuesday whether he was likely to consider only moderate candidates, the President flatly said \u201cno.\u201d He\u2019ll spend his weekend delving into the records and job histories of potential candidates, according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. White House lawyers have prepared lengthy briefing dossiers for Obama\u2019s review that include detailed accounts of top picks for the court. Earnest said Obama does not yet have a shortlist of candidates. He would not specify how many nominees were being reviewed, but he did say it was more than two and that the list is not complete. As the week wound down, Obama himself phoned leaders in the Senate \u2013 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Leader Harry Reid, along with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sens. Chuck Grassley and Patrick Leahy \u2013 to discuss the process going forward. \u201cThe President will consult a wide variety of individuals with a wide variety of perspectives as he contemplates his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court,\u201d Earnest said. But even as the White House insists Obama is reviewing a broad range of candidates, signals are emerging that a candidate without staunchly liberal credentials is the preferred choice for Obama\u2019s closest advisers. \u201cThe Senate gets to have a say, and so in order to get this done, the President is not going to be able to go out \u2013 nor would it be his instinct anyway \u2013 to pick the most liberal jurist in the nation and put them on the court. There are plenty of judges on high courts already who have had unanimous support of the Republicans,\u201d Biden told Minnesota Public Radio in an interview this week. Biden served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during his decades on Capitol Hill, and presided over Supreme Court nominee hearings himself, including contentious meetings with Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. He\u2019s expected to act as an adviser to Obama during the nominee selection process and a liaison to his former colleagues in the Senate once an appointment is made. \u201cWe have to pick somebody, as the President will, who is intellectually competent, is a person of high moral character, is a person who is demonstrated to have an open mind, and is a person who doesn\u2019t come with a specific agenda,\u201d he told Politico and The Washington Post in an interview aboard his vice presidential aircraft Thursday. He described the ideal person as a \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d in an interview with MSNBC. It\u2019s a strategy that could disappoint some liberals, who are pushing the White House to advance a strongly left-leaning candidate that could galvanize Democratic voters heading into this year\u2019s election. \u201cThe tremendous amount of grassroots energy focused on ensuring the Republican Senate votes on President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee will dissipate dramatically if he nominates a candidate who isn\u2019t rock solid in their commitment to major progressive priorities for the court like protecting abortion rights and ending Citizens United,\u201d said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of liberal group Democracy for America. But it\u2019s the favorite position of many Senate Democrats, who have suggested a moderate candidate who still gains little support from Republicans could inflict damage on the GOP. The White House, officially quiet on what type of candidates Obama considering, has offered some general characteristics that Obama is looking for in a nominee. Earnest said this week that \u201cindividuals who have a thick skin\u201d are necessary to survive the intrusive vetting process to secure a nomination, and later undergo contentious hearings on Capitol Hill, though Republicans have yet to announce whether those hearings will actually go forward. Earlier in the week, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama was seeking candidates with \u201cimpeccable credentials\u201d who \u201crespect the integrity of the judicial process\u201d but also brings \u201chis or her own ethics and moral bearings into a decision.\u201d But on Thursday, Earnest also suggested a nominee with a history of support from Republicans would be given ample consideration, saying Biden had pointed out a \u201crelevant fact\u201d by highlighting justices who had gained bipartisan support. \u201cThere is a track record that the President has of appointing people whose qualifications are beyond question,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cAnd I would expect that the President will nominate someone else \u2013 or someone to the Supreme Court who has credentials that could be similarly described.\u201d CNN\u2019s Michelle Kosinski contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Marco Rubio showed why he spooks Democrats, while Ted Cruz tried to put a scare into Donald Trump during CNN\u2019s town hall Wednesday night. The first three candidates to participate in the two-night event moderated by Anderson Cooper showcased their different styles of conservatism. Ben Carson quoted Scripture to show how faith guides his politics. Rubio, the senator from Florida, told stories about the values he learned as a child. And Cruz, the senator from Texas, argued he\u2019s the most rock-ribbed of them all, saying he has defended conservative values throughout his private and public career. Here are five takeaways from the town hall\u2019s first night: After a day of denouncing Trump on the campaign trial \u2013 even calling a press conference to blast the billionaire businessman \u2013 Cruz kept it up on the town hall stage. Within the first minute of his appearance, Cruz unloaded on Trump, lambasting his history of supporting abortion rights, donating to Democratic candidates and filing what Cruz called frivolous lawsuits (including the one Trump is threatening to file against Cruz to challenge his eligibility to be president). He slammed Trump\u2019s cease-and-desist letter aimed at an attack ad Cruz is running in South Carolina. \u201cIt is quite literally the most ridiculous theory I\u2019ve ever heard, that telling the voters what Trump\u2019s actual record is is deceitful and lying,\u201d Cruz said. The fight with Trump has become all-consuming for Cruz\u2019s campaign in recent days \u2013 a stark departure from the months the two spent courting each other last year. Cruz attacked Trump while defending his own credentials as he argued that he\u2019s the candidate voters know will appoint right-leaning Supreme Court justices. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re pro-life. Tell me what you\u2019ve done to defend the right to life,\u201d Cruz said. His comments underscored his position in the race. Cruz feels he is within striking distance of Trump, and he\u2019s fighting for first place rather than reprising his debate-stage battles with Rubio, who polls show is currently in third, behind Trump and Cruz. Cruz\u2019s performance showed why he was an effective lawyer. He touted fighting for constitutional freedoms his entire adult life, both as a government attorney and in private practice. He easily fielded a question about whether his Canadian birthplace calls his eligibility for the presidency into question, saying he\u2019s \u201cnever breathed a breath of air\u201d as anything but an American citizen. And he explained why many of his Senate colleagues, as one questioner said, don\u2019t like him. Ted Cruz: Here's why people think I'm unlikable \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why they say Ted is unlikable in Washington,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m actually honoring the commitments I made to the men and women who elected me.\u201d Rubio showed why he strikes fear into Democrats\u2019 hearts \u2013 and he did it in a single answer. Asked how he\u2019d address racism, the senator from Florida showcased perhaps his most valuable skill: an ability to connect his life story and personal experience to his political values. He said he has an African-American friend who is a police officer himself \u2013 yet was pulled over \u201cseven, eight times\u201d over several years, without ever being ticketed. \u201cWhat is he supposed to think?\u201d Rubio asked. Marco Rubio addresses racism in America When Cooper asked Rubio whether he\u2019d experienced racism in his own life, the senator recalled being 7 years old in Las Vegas during 1980\u2019s Mariel boatlift \u2013 a mass emigration of Cubans to the United States. He remembered neighborhood teenagers yelling at his Cuban-born parents to \u201cget back on the boat.\u201d \u201cWhat boat? My mom doesn\u2019t even swim! She\u2019s afraid of water,\u201d he said, explaining his thoughts as a child, prompting laughter in the audience. He spoke with ease and compassion about academic underperformance, \u201cbroken homes, dangerous housing, substandard housing\u201d and other race-related challenges. \u201cA child that\u2019s born with four strikes against them is going to struggle to succeed unless something breaks that cycle,\u201d Rubio said. It\u2019s becoming a go-to joke for Ben Carson at debates: He never gets enough time to speak. But on Wednesday, without the buzzers, interjecting moderators and other candidates contending for talk time, he was able to delve more deeply into his life story. The retired neurosurgeon used that time to talk about his mild-mannered demeanor and argue that \u2013 despite GOP concerns \u2013 it would help him confront a Democratic opponent in the general election. Ben Carson on Christian values and role of government \u201cI had a program at the hospital where I\u2019d bring in 800 students at a time, frequently elementary students, and you would say, \u2018How are you going to be able to speak to 800 elementary students and keep them quiet?\u2019 You know what? By speaking softly. Because then they\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, what\u2019s he saying?\u2019 And they would shut up,\u201d Carson said. Carson also talked about his hobbies, saying he loves to shoot pool \u2013 particularly with his wife, who can beat him. \u201cI like to win,\u201d Carson said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you, it relaxes me. When I would come home from a busy day of surgery, I would shoot pool.\u201d The town hall unfolded a day after the U.S. government won a key court ruling that would require Apple to unlock one of the San Bernardino shooters\u2019 iPhones \u2013 a decision that alarmed both the company and advocates of civil liberties. To varying degrees, the candidates backed the government \u2013 even as they tried to acknowledge the powerful strain of libertarian politics in the GOP. Cruz argued the company can\u2019t defy the legal process. \u201cAny time you\u2019re dealing with issues of security and civil liberties, you\u2019ve got to balance them both,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can protect ourselves from terrorism and also protect our civil rights.\u201d Rubio, meanwhile, acknowledged Apple\u2019s concerns that if it is forced to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into its iPhones, it\u2019s possible a \u201ccriminal gang could figure out what the backdoor is.\u201d \u201cThere has to be a way to deal with this issue that continues to protect the privacy of Americans, but creates some process by which law enforcement and intelligence agencies could access encrypted information,\u201d Rubio said. He continued: \u201cI don\u2019t have a magic solution for it today. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s a new issue that\u2019s emerged just in the last couple of years. But I do know this: It will take a partnership between the technology industry and the government to confront and solve this.\u201d Rubio did, however, say the company will end up having to comply with the court order. Carson said Americans \u201chave to get over\u201d their distrust of the government. He called for a public-private partnership to address technical and cybersecurity challenges. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be a matter of people learning to trust each other, which means Apple needs to sit down with trustworthy members of the government,\u201d Carson said. \u201cAnd that may have to wait until the next election, I don\u2019t know, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d Carson digs Baroque. Rubio loves EDM (that\u2019s electronic dance music). And when Cruz calls his wife, he makes up new lyrics for \u201ccorny\u201d songs. As Rubio embraced EDM, which has grown increasingly popular among young people in recent years, he explained the genre for the conservative audience. He joked that \u201cmaybe people thought it was something else.\u201d When Cooper asked Rubio if he\u2019s ever been to a rave, though, things really got good. An incredulous Rubio said he hadn\u2019t, and then added, \u201cIt\u2019s a Republican primary, Anderson!\u201d He joked about the tall black boots he once wore in New Hampshire \u2013 which became the butt of jokes from candidates like Trump. \u201cI\u2019m a little old to be going to a rave. Although I have the boots for it!\u201d Rubio said. Then he made the most conservative-sounding case in history for the often lyricless EDM, saying that \u201cthe lyrics are clean.\u201d Carson\u2019s iPod likely doesn\u2019t have so much pump-me-up music. \u201cI primarily like classical music, particularly Baroque music,\u201d he said. He said he used to have new doctors in their rotations learn about music in addition to medicine. Cruz said he sometimes sings to his wife, Heidi, when he calls. \u201cAnd I am a painfully horrible singer.\u201d Cooper asked: \u201cIs this punishment?\u201d And a laughing Cruz responded, \u201cI\u2019m hoping it is sort of sincere and endearing.\u201d \u201cI actually don\u2019t sing musicals,\u201d he said. \u201cI will sing things like, \u2018Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling, Heidi-tine.\u2019 Which is really corny, but I used to do it when she\u2019d put it on speaker phone in her office, and embarrass her.\u201d",

Abortion has emerged as the latest terrain for Cruz and Trump to argue over who is the true social conservative in the race, and the billionaire businessman has charged that the Texas senator is lying.

            "article_content": "Whoever accepts Obama's nomination will walk into a wall of political fire A nominee could be left hanging in limbo for a year with no guarantee that they'll end up on the court It might be the best job in town \u2013 at the worst possible time. President Barack Obama is suddenly searching for a new Supreme Court justice after the death of conservative icon Antonin Scalia left a rare vacancy at the pinnacle of U.S. jurisprudence. Normally, an open spot on the exalted bench \u2013 complete with a lifetime tenure and a boatload of benefits \u2013 would have those who labor in the law\u2019s dusty obscurity salivating at the chance to crown their careers in the black robes of the nation\u2019s highest court. And candidates with political inclinations have extra incentive to covet this particular seat, as it comes with a chance to tilt the ideological balance of the court and shape the nation\u2019s future for decades. Justice Antonin Scalia's life in photos But this time, things are different. Whoever accepts Obama\u2019s nomination will walk into a wall of political fire. A pitched battle is already raging over Scalia\u2019s seat, embroiling the White House, Congress and presidential candidates eager to whip up grass-roots activists. READ: Inside Obama\u2019s process for replacing Antonin Scalia White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz insisted Monday that Obama will nominate a successor to Scalia. But for all their troubles, whoever is chosen could very well not end up with the job. Senate Republicans are warning that they may not even grant Obama\u2019s nominee a hearing, saying it should be up to the next president to fill the vacancy. A nominee could be left hanging in limbo for a year with no guarantee that, even if a Democrat wins in November, they\u2019ll end up on the court. Of course, if a Republican wins the White House, they can forget it. At worst, if the GOP relents and holds confirmation hearings, the nominee could emerge so damaged by the political tumult that their reputation could be shredded along with their hopes of one day reaching the Supreme Court. Even without the intrigue surrounding Scalia\u2019s potential replacement, the modern Supreme Court nomination process is a trial to be endured. The latest issue of the New Yorker reports that Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor found her 2009 hearings a \u201chorrible experience\u201d that \u201creally got her down.\u201d READ: White House dismisses GOP \u2018bluster\u2019 on Scalia replacement For Obama\u2019s next nominee, the ordeal will be many times worse. And there doesn\u2019t seem any obvious way for Obama to shield his pick. \u201cIt is possible that he could bend this like Beckham and get it through,\u201d Jonathan Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University told CNN\u2019s Jim Scuitto. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t bet on it it. The fact is, you are replacing a conservative icon. Any moderate nominee is going to move this needle to the left on the court and it is going to be a battle royale.\u201d The sudden opening on the court is emerging as a top issue in an already vicious White House campaign, and threatens to expose the eventual nominee to the full fury of the conservative political, legal and media machine. So it would be no wonder if a candidate might choose to take a pass on the partisan anger that surrounded the likes of Clarence Thomas, who did make it to the court. Ronald Reagan\u2019s nominee, Robert Bork, and Harriet Miers, George W. Bush\u2019s White House counsel and Supreme Court pick, did not make it through the acrimonious process. It would be difficult to see, for instance, why one often-mentioned potential presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, the California Attorney General who is running for a Senate seat, would instead opt for a Supreme Court spot that might be a mirage. There might also be a case for the President to take on a pass on someone like Sri Srinivasan, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who many see as a Supreme Court justice in waiting. Today's Supreme Court Srinivasan, who has historic potential as the first Indian-American on the high court, was confirmed unanimously by the Senate for his current post. But his supporters might see a nomination now as a waste, given the risk that he could be burned by a bitter confirmation process and left too stigmatized to be viable in future. So what type of nominee might be willing to take on such a poisoned chalice? For sure, whoever is picked would have to be a rare glutton for punishment. But some legal experts believe the White House will still have no trouble drawing up a list. \u201cNumber One \u2013 most judges, if they are not sitting on the Supreme Court, toil in relative anonymity,\u201d said Professor David Ryden of Hope College, Michigan, whose research focuses on the how the Supreme Court influences the electoral process. \u201cThey are human beings. There is the lure of the limelight and there is the honor of being named.\u201d READ: Top Democrats to White House: Take Supreme Court fight to GOP Daniel Franklin, a Georgia State University political science professor and author of the book \u201cPitiful Giants: Presidents In Their Final Term,\u201d said that for lawyers, the Supreme Court is the equivalent of the big leagues. That could mean that even a nomination as challenged as this one is special. \u201cIf you say, you have a remote chance of playing center fielder for the Dodgers, I would take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is still a pretty big deal.\u201d There are some potential ways out of the imbroglio for Obama that involve finding an unorthodox candidate who might be flattered by a nomination. Since the effort to replace Scalia comes in the twilight of his presidency, Obama has much less leverage than when he picked Sotomayor and Elena Kagan in his first term. That means he may have no choice but to settle on someone less palatable to liberals but who might increase his minimal chances of winning a confirmation. \u201cThe president is on the ideological spectrum at one point and the Senate is on the ideological spectrum on another,\u201d said Franklin. \u201cEven in a normal circumstance, the President has to meet the Senate somewhere in the middle with his preference while getting someone as close to his preference as possible.\u201d Franklin added: \u201cNow, he has to move that point closer and closer to the Senate\u2019s point of preference.\u201d If Obama\u2019s priority is to get a justice confirmed at all costs, he could call Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s bluff and name a moderate, establishment Republican who GOP senators would feel forced to support \u2013 perhaps someone like GOP Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah or Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi as the nominee, Franklin said. But that approach \u2013 effectively installing a pro-life nominee with big abortion cases looming \u2013 would enrage Obama\u2019s liberal backers. Still, it would move the court incrementally left on some issues from where it stood when Scalia was alive. And since Hatch and Cochran are 81 and 78 respectively, they would unlikely be a choice that would haunt the President for decades. Such a scenario, however, seems remote given the political ire of the times. Obama seems more likely to take a more nakedly political route. He could pick someone he knows is unlikely to be confirmed, but who would be willing to do a service for their party and become a cause celebre throughout election season. A politician already locked in the heat of partisan battle might work in this case  \u2013 that\u2019s why the names of Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey have been floated. Neither have re-election races in 2016 and both are rumored to have presidential ambitions that might benefit from a spell in the national partisan spotlight. And if for some reason their colleagues found it impossible to block them in the Senate\u2019s clubby atmosphere, there are worst places to end up than on the Supreme Court. Another approach would be to choose a candidate who is a woman or a minority \u2013 perhaps someone from the Hispanic community \u2013  who could be crucial in driving up Democratic turnout in November. Stalwart Republican opposition to such a nominee would enable Democrats to paint the GOP as prejudiced and motivated by considerations other than legal reservations \u2013 and perhaps might embarrass some swing-state Senate Republicans up for re-election. And even some judges already on lower courts might be willing to serve as a political placeholders for such a strategy, said Ryden of Hope College. \u201cJudges have their own political preferences and agendas and there are many on the federal court bench \u2026 who would fit that label and be happy to collaborate on a strategy with the White House \u2013 even if they weren\u2019t the ones who would immediately benefit from it,\u201d he said.",

Schultz pointed to previous White House victories over the GOP-led Congress \u2013 raising the debt limit, implementing the Iran nuclear deal and reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank \u2013 and said history shows \u201cRepublicans fell back when their positions aren\u2019t tenable.\u201d Washington is in tumult after the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia, which left a turbulent White House race transformed, a lame-duck president back at the center of the political storm and Senate Republican leaders juggling an electoral hand grenade. After the shock of Scalia\u2019s passing and the swift eruption of a bitter partisan feud over his replacement, Obama and his GOP adversaries are digging in for a showdown. Schultz emphasized Obama\u2019s plans to nominate a successor to Scalia and said it\u2019s the Senate\u2019s job to fulfill its constitutional duty to consider that nominee. \u201cThere are no caveats. The Constitution does not include exemptions for election years or for the president\u2019s last term in office.

I would not anticipate an announcement this week, especially given that the Senate is out of recess,\u201d Schultz said Monday. \u201cBut as soon as the Senate returns, the president was very clear that he\u2019s going to fulfill his constitutional responsibility to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia.\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia's life in photos That position ensures a titanic fight over Scalia\u2019s replacement, placing Obama on a collision course with Republicans while thickening the plot of an election that now leaves the White House, the Senate and the nation\u2019s top court up for grabs. READ: Scalia-Ginsburg friendship bridged opposing ideologies GOP presidential candidates are leading the charge in the battle over a replacement for Scalia, a beloved icon for conservatives who was found dead at the age of 79 at a resort in West Texas on Saturday. They are warning that since an appointment could remake the court for a generation as key legal battles over abortion rights, affirmative action and campaign finance loom, it should be put off until next year. \u201cThis is for the people to decide,\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said at a rally in South Carolina on Monday. \u201cI intend to make 2016 a referendum on the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already warned Obama not to try to fill the vacancy on the Court, saying it should be up to a new president to weigh in once voters have spoken in November. READ: David Axelrod: A surprising request from Justice Scalia McConnell must navigate a treacherous political moment and decide whether a Republican maneuver to block a confirmation process could benefit his party at the polls or risk driving up Democratic turnout in November and put his grip on the Senate at risk. Today's Supreme Court Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and several other Democrats want Obama to choose a Supreme Court nominee who would inflict maximum political pain on Republicans because he or she would be very difficult for the GOP to oppose, according to two Democratic sources. In other words, some influential Senate Democrats want Obama to choose a nominee who Republicans would ordinarily support but are only opposing now because it\u2019s an election year. This, they believe, would allow them to paint the GOP as intransigent and well outside of the mainstream, undermining the Senate GOP\u2019s election-year argument that they are committed to governing in a bipartisan manner. Going this route, they believe, would increasingly ratchet up pressure on at-risk Republicans who are facing tough reelections, energize the Democratic base and potentially flip the Senate if the GOP stands in their way and denies a popular nominee a vote. Reid spoke with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough shortly after Scalia\u2019s death, according to a source familiar with the call. READ: Ted Cruz releases Supreme Court ad after Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death It\u2019s unclear who specifically Reid wants in the post. Some Democrats point to appellate judge Sri Srinivasan, who would be the first justice of South Asian descent serving on the court and was confirmed to his current post by a 97-0 vote in 2013. \u201cI think the president, past is prologue, will nominate someone who is in the mainstream,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, the likely incoming Democratic leader, said Sunday. But several other Democrats are also pointing to other potential groundbreaking choices and candidates who don\u2019t hold judicial posts, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota and Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The sudden political crisis also put one group of Republicans \u2013 swing-state senators whose seats could dictate whether the GOP can hang on to the chamber in November \u2013 in a difficult position. Privately, senior Democratic officials told CNN that there\u2019s little chance of Obama\u2019s nominee winning confirmation unless these endangered GOPers break ranks. READ: What happens to Supreme Court cases this year? One vulnerable incumbent, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, would not say if they wanted the Senate to deny Obama\u2019s nominee a vote. Sen. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia, who often votes with Republicans, wants the Senate to act on a nominee when the President puts one forward, an aide to the senator told CNN. But several others made clear they stood with Republican leaders who believe that the issue could invigorate conservative turnout in November. \u201cI strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a vulnerable incumbent, said in an email to CNN. And in a statement, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican facing a competitive reelection fight in 2016, said the Senate should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee until a new president is elected. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a consequential presidential election year,\u201d Ayotte said, \u201cand Americans deserve an opportunity to weigh in given the significant implications this nomination could have for the Supreme Court and our country for decades to come.\u201d On Monday, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania became the fourth of five swing-state Republicans to back McConnell\u2019s strategy. \u201cWe should honor Justice Scalia\u2019s legacy, and we should put off a decision on his replacement until the newly-elected president can make his or her choice,\u201d Toomey said in a statement. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican up for re-election this year, also said Monday he thought the future president should nominate Scalia\u2019s replacement. \u201cWhether the next president is a Republican or Democrat, I will judge any nominee on the merits, as I always have,\u201d Portman said in a statement.

            "article_content": "Obama says he will nominate someone to replace Scalia \"in due time\" McConnell, Reid clash over whether Obama should name a successor Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death immediately triggered a monumental election-year battle in Washington over whether President Barack Obama should choose a successor who could tilt the Supreme Court toward liberals. Within two hours of Scalia\u2019s death being reported, presidential candidates along with Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were feuding over whether Obama should appoint a replacement for the eloquent and outspoken Scalia or wait for the next administration to make a decision. The battle lines underscored the huge political stakes in the 2016 election, which could cement the ideological balance of the court for years to come. Obama: Antonin Scalia 'a larger than life presence' Obama said Saturday he would nominate a successor \u201cin due time,\u201d but Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted the next administration should make the appointment. \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.\u201d But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid issued a scathing statement, previewing the heated fight ahead. \u201cThe President can and should send the Senate a nominee right away,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWith so many important issues pending before the Supreme Court, the Senate has a responsibility to fill vacancies as soon as possible. It would be unprecedented in recent history for the Supreme Court to go a year with a vacant seat. Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate\u2019s most essential Constitutional responsibilities.\u201d READ: Politicians honor Justice Antonin Scalia News of Scalia\u2019s death broke hours before the latest Republican presidential debate and added another explosive element to a heated GOP primary campaign. Even before Saturday, the fate of the Supreme Court was already a key election issue, given the possibility that the next President could get the chance to nominate at least two or three Justices due to the age of those on the bench and the possible shift of the ideological balance of the court. Scalia's life in photos After observing a moment of silence to honor Scalia, the GOP candidates, who clashed in South Carolina, seized on his death to draw battle lines in the debate over his successor. \u201cI do not believe the President should appoint someone,\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said, warning that Obama would \u201cram down our throat a liberal justice.\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a former Supreme Court clerk, warned: \u201cWe are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans.\u201d \u201cThe Senate needs to stand strong and say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. Republican front-runner Donald Trump said he was sure that Obama would not listen to Republicans and would go ahead and name a nominee, adding \u201cI think it\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell, and everybody else to stop it. It\u2019s called delay, delay, delay.\u201d READ: Antonin Scalia\u2019s 10 most memorable lines On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton lined up with the Democratic leaders in Congress to seize on a issue that will now be at the center of her campaign. \u201cBarack Obama is President of the United States until January 20, 2017. That is a fact, my friends, whether the Republicans like it or not. Elections have consequences. The President has a responsibility to nominate a new justice and the Senate has a responsibility to vote,\u201d Clinton said during a visit in Denver. Clinton\u2019s Democratic rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also issued a statement that offered sympathy while acknowledging philosophical differences. He did not however weigh in on the issue of the timing of a nomination. People we've lost in 2016 \u201cWhile I differed with Justice Scalia\u2019s views and jurisprudence, he was a brilliant, colorful and outspoken member of the Supreme Court. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and his colleagues on the court who mourn his passing.\u201d Scalia, who was found dead Saturday, was one of the most influential conservative justices in history and forged a decades-long legacy that prolonged Ronald Reagan\u2019s conservative revolution, long after the President who nominated him left office. Scalia was also seen as a hugely powerful foe by liberal groups owing to his positions on issues like abortion and the Second Amendment, and those groups will pile enormous pressure on Obama to send a liberal justice to the court before he leaves office. READ: How Scalia\u2019s death could change America CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin predicted \u201cone of the great battles in United States history\u201d looms over whether \u201cObama\u2019s nominee even gets a vote.\u201d GOP candidates react to the passing of Justice Scalia \u201cThe Senate Republicans recognize how important it is to maintain a conservative majority on the court,\u201d Toobin said, noting that Obama would leave office in January. \u201cThe question will be whether President Obama\u2019s nominee, who I expect will come quickly, will get a vote at all in the remaining months of this presidency.\u201d Scalia\u2019s death means that the 2016 election could effectively evolve into a battle involving all three branches of the U.S. government, the White House, the Supreme Court and Congress \u2014 given that there is a real chance the GOP could lose control of the Senate. It also comes at a time when the Court is expected to decide several cases with huge political implications, including on abortion and affirmative action. The new political showdown over the Supreme Court will ensure that Obama remains at the center of both the political stew in Washington and the battle to replace him at the point in his tenure when many presidents come to be regarded as lame ducks.

            "article_content": "Justice Antonin Scalia was a verbose bogeyman to the liberals he prodded and provoked during his nearly three decades on the Supreme Court The New Jersey-born Scalia, who died in his sleep over the weekend, had a talent for making his allies squeal and opponents squirm A hero to many conservatives, Justice Antonin Scalia was a verbose bogeyman to liberals during his nearly three decades on the Supreme Court. In public speeches, comments from the bench and in his written opinions, the New Jersey-born Scalia, who died in his sleep over the weekend, had a talent for making his allies squeal and opponents squirm. Though Scalia\u2019s words sometimes offended, they sometimes delighted, and, on some occasions, made almost everyone laugh. Here are 10 of the late justice\u2019s most memorable quotes. \u201cThe purpose of Indiana\u2019s nudity law would be violated, I think, if 60,000 fully consenting adults crowded into the Hoosierdome to display their genitals to one another, even if there were not an offended innocent in the crowd,\u201d Scalia wrote, concurring with the majority in Barnes v. Glen Theatre. \u201cThe death penalty? Give me a break. It\u2019s easy. Abortion? Absolutely easy. Nobody ever thought the Constitution prevented restrictions on abortion. Homosexual sodomy? Come on. For 200 years, it was criminal in every state,\u201d he said in October at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe court\u2019s next bit of interpretive jiggery-pokery involves other parts of the Act that purportedly presuppose the availability of tax credits on both federal and state Exchanges,\u201d Scalia wrote, before dismissing another point as \u201cpure applesauce.\u201d \u201cGee, I really don\u2019t wanna get into \u2013 I mean this is \u2013 get over it. It\u2019s so old by now. The principal issue in the case, whether the scheme that the Florida Supreme Court had put together violated the federal Constitution, that wasn\u2019t even close. The vote was seven to two,\u201d Scalia told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d after being asked about the case that effectively ended the 2000 general election fight. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at me as though I\u2019m weird,\u201d he said to New York magazine\u2019s Jennifer Senior in the course of a long Q&A in 2013. \u201cMy God! Are you so out of touch with most of America, most of which believes in the Devil? I mean, Jesus Christ believed in the Devil! It\u2019s in the Gospels! You travel in circles that are so, so removed from mainstream America that you are appalled that anybody would believe in the Devil! Most of mankind has believed in the Devil, for all of history. Many more intelligent people than you or me have believed in the Devil.\u201d \u201cSometimes people come up to me and inquire, \u2018Justice Scalia, when did you first become an originalist?\u2019 As though it\u2019s some weird affliction, you know, \u2018When did you start eating human flesh?\u2019 \u201d Scalia said, as reported on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cObviously the (Second) Amendment does not apply to arms that cannot be hand-carried \u2013 it\u2019s to keep and \u2018bear,\u2019 so it doesn\u2019t apply to cannons \u2013 but I suppose here are hand-held rocket launchers that can bring down airplanes, that will have to be decided,\u201d he said during a Fox News Sunday interview in 2012. \u201cIf we cannot have moral feelings against homosexuality, can we have it against murder? Can we have it against other things?\u201d he asked a college freshman who questioned him about his past writings. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you aren\u2019t persuaded,\u201d Scalia added, after insisting he was not seeking to equate sodomy with murder. \u201cMaybe the legislature and the president are not as stupid as you think,\u201d Scalia said during a panel discussion on one of his books. \u201cThey assuredly picked those people because of who they are and when they get to the court they remain who they were.\u201d In an interview with Charlie Rose in 2012, he said: \u201cA man who has made no enemies is probably not a very good man.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Chris Christie dropped out of the presidential race Wednesday after a sixth-place finish in New Hampshire Christie became pre-occupied with Marco Rubio's rise in the polls, and attacked him at the last debate before Tuesday's primary He started from behind in the race, and was buried by negative ads as soon as he showed traction New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie poured everything he had into New Hampshire, clawing his way up the polls in a crowded field and Donald Trump-dominated year while tainted by scandal back home. Rubio, Christie exchange blows early And Marco Rubio threatened to take it all away. In the last few weeks before Tuesday\u2019s primary, and under fire from Rubio and his super PACs, Christie became pre-occupied with the Florida senator. Christie\u2019s criticism of the candidate grew increasingly sharp behind closed doors, according to people familiar with the conversations. He would see a Rubio interview or read a story featuring Rubio and complain to staff or supporters that he simply did not see the appeal. He listened to Rubio provide canned quotes in each debate and, when attacked, refuse to look Christie in the eye during his response, Christie told people. It was a sign of weakness \u2013 and a sign of a weak candidate \u2013 in his view. How the outsiders won \u2013 and the insiders crumbled By Saturday night in Goffstown, New Hampshire, after Rubio\u2019s surprising third-place finish in Iowa, everyone knew what was coming, Rubio included. \u201cMarco, the thing is this,\u201d Christie said at the ABC debate at St. Anselm\u2019s College. \u201cWhen you\u2019re president of the United States, when you\u2019re a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn\u2019t solve one problem for one person.\u201d Republican candidates: Who is Donald Trump? | Who is Marco Rubio? | Who is John Kasich? Asked the next day how Rubio could\u2019ve missed what was coming, Christie resorted to \u201cthe great political philosopher Mike Tyson,\u201d the famous former world heavyweight-boxing champion. \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the face,\u201d Christie told reporters. Christie, after all, had been getting punched in the face for two years. He could now take credit for wounding a candidate he and his team viewed as unprepared for the job. But that would be the extent of his accomplishments in New Hampshire. Tuesday night, he received his own knockout blow, finishing sixth in New Hampshire. Wednesday, he threw in the towel. Democratic candidates: Who is Hillary Clinton? | Who is Bernie Sanders? \u201cI ran for president to say that the government needs to once again work for the people, not the people work for the government. And while running for president I tried to reinforce what I have always believed \u2013 that speaking your mind matters, that experience matters, that competence matters and that it will always matter in leading our nation,\u201d Christie wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cThat message was heard by and stood for by a lot of people, but just not enough and that\u2019s OK.\u201d The story of Christie\u2019s rise and fall in the state where he pinned all of his hopes is based on interviews with more than a dozen of his advisers, donors, fundraisers, supporters and rival campaign aides. In the end, Christie could not get past both his own personal baggage and his status as another governor of a moderate or blue state selling his personal appeal during a general election campaign to a Republican base clearly looking for new blood. Carly Fiorina ends presidential bid Who's running for president? Once considered a front-runner in the 2016 sweepstakes, a litany of policy decisions back home in New Jersey, combined with the federal investigation into a politically driven bridge closing crafted by his staff in the governor\u2019s office, had marred his hopes \u2013 so much so that many top Republicans wondered whether a run was worth it at all. And in a race dominated by GOP outsiders like Trump, a governor touting his experience, a la Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, John Kasich and George Pataki, wasn\u2019t a strong sell. Christie announced his candidacy knowing full well that he had a lot of ground to make up. With a group of top-tier advisers, he went to work early crafting a strategy to vault himself back into the GOP top tier. That plan revolved around New Hampshire, following the tradition of the state\u2019s successful candidates: come often, work hard, shower the state\u2019s politicians with attention (or, in Christie\u2019s case, never-ending text messages) and the rest will take care of itself. He would spend more than 70 days in the state, holding 160 events and 60 town halls. New Hampshire primaries: 5 takeaways But as the months moved along and Donald Trump upended every campaign\u2019s initial plans, the topline strategy inside Christie\u2019s team evolved into a multi-part bank shot \u2013 one that even they would admit needed breaks to succeed. On paper, it was perfect: First, Christie would use his deep connections to popular Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad to harness a better-than-terrible showing in Iowa. Then, he would go back to New Hampshire, where his campaign and its supporting super PAC had invested a majority of their resources in on-the-the ground work and television advertising to turn flagging favorability ratings upside down. Finally, he\u2019d have a big debate night, and close the deal with the historically (and frustratingly) late-deciding voters in the state. A strong showing Tuesday would then open the doors to their extensive supporter and donor networks \u2014 a deep-pocketed group wary of sending a first-term senator like Rubio to the White House. As the chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2014, Christie helped elect seven new GOP governors and divvied up extensive financial resources \u2013 to the tune of $100 million \u2013 to help 17 others gain re-election. Prove his viability and those investments in time and money would come home, his advisers predicted. By mid-January, it all seemed to be working. Christie\u2019s approval ratings had jumped as many as 20 points in Granite State polls. His town halls became events in themselves \u2013 each bigger than the next. His campaign and supporting super PAC saw the events register so well that they became the basis of many of their television ads \u2013 a straight-talking governor with real experience, who had notched a sweeping re-election victory in a traditionally Democrat-leaning state. David Sacks, an independent voter from Hollis, vividly remembered his first interaction with Christie at a friend\u2019s house. \u201cHe grabbed me immediately,\u201d Sacks said. He left the event saying to himself, \u201cMan, this is the guy,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhy not Christie?\u201d But the liabilities never dissipated. New Jersey\u2019s economy, while on the upswing in recent months, had been bleak for much of Christie\u2019s tenure. Opposition research, shared with CNN from multiple campaigns, was extensive on areas where Christie allegedly took positions that broke with Republican orthodoxy. One aide in a rival campaign put it succinctly: \u201cWe all saw his rise \u2013 it was very real \u2013 but we were never worried. We knew a week of negative ads would bring him back down to earth whenever we wanted.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what happened. Super PACs supporting Bush, Rubio and Kasich unloaded on Christie, attacking him on his state\u2019s acceptance of Common Core on education, the Bridge-gate scandal and past statements on gun control and abortion. Rubio himself started reading, theatrically from a piece of paper pulled from his pocket, Christie\u2019s press release that appeared to make it look like he supported President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor. Within weeks, Christie\u2019s favorability ratings nose-dived and so did his poll numbers. Meanwhile, Christie\u2019s financial picture continued to worsen. He closed 2015 with a little more than $1 million to spend. While money was still coming in \u2013 a series of fundraisers in January brought in seven figures, according to two people familiar with the process \u2013 it wasn\u2019t nearly enough to challenge the seemingly endless attacks that were coming his way. His foray into Iowa fell flat, even with the extensive Branstad connections and two campaign stops with the governor himself. He logged the 2% he\u2019d been polling at for months and in the process, frustrated donors by undertaking a six-day swing through Iowa \u2014 time that could have been spent working relatively unopposed in New Hampshire. Days before New Hampshire voters went to the polls, Christie was struggling to stay in the conversation, falling into the mid-single digits and struggling to rediscover the message that connected. From that, the plan became: attack Rubio. The initial attack was always in the plans, but just how personal it got was not, according to aides. During the drive to his New Hampshire campaign headquarters in Bedford, he made clear that while he was resolved to launch his first salvo, he would stay away from personal attacks. At an arranged meeting with reporters after he greeted volunteers, he almost succeeded. He started by saying it would be an \u201cinteresting week\u201d for Rubio and went through his practiced lines about the dangers of first term senators. But as the question and answer session was about to end, something clicked in Christie. He proceeded to launch into a three-minute personal indictment of Rubio\u2019s lack of political talent, reliance on advisers, inability to do retail politics and general lack of life accomplishment. He punctuated each attack line with a new nickname for Rubio: \u201cthe boy in the bubble.\u201d The backstory is both strategic and personal for Christie. Rubio came out of Iowa with the wind at his back \u2013 so much so that members of Christie\u2019s team received calls from certain party stalwarts that appeared to hint that it was time for Christie to drop out and the party to coalesce around Rubio. Christie, who had been swiping at Rubio for weeks in town halls, wanted to cut off the Florida senator\u2019s rise before supporters and, more importantly, donors started to flee. Christie had a good idea that he\u2019d pulled off what he pledged to do at Saturday night\u2019s debate, but he wasn\u2019t sure. It was none other than Donald Trump who confirmed what Christie thought during the first commercial break. \u201cWow. That was tremendous,\u201d Trump said, grabbing Christie\u2019s arm, according to a source familiar with the exchange. His next stop was a check-in with his wife, Mary Pat, standing off the stage. She echoed Trump\u2019s analysis. The 72 hours that followed comprised of part victory lap \u2014 it was clear Christie had frozen the post-Iowa rush of donors and supporters to Rubio \u2013 and part urgent campaign push to lock in the voters falling away from the senator. The campaign\u2019s internal polling showed a consistent uptick in Christie\u2019s numbers, but more and more, things were shifting toward Bush and among, undeclared voters, Kasich. While Christie did the work everyone in the race was hoping for, it increasingly looked like he wouldn\u2019t be the candidate to benefit. Marco\u2019s reboot: How Rubio plans to turn things around Gov. Chris Christie on State of the Union: Full Interview Christie was convinced after Saturday that the race had been flipped on its head \u2013 no longer was finishing first among governors the metric. Instead, it was survive and advance, get to the next debate and try for another big moment. Then CBS News released its criteria to qualify for the next debate. Only the top five in New Hampshire would move forward. By 10 p.m. on primary night, it became clear Christie would do no better than sixth. As Christie walked to the podium in the ballroom at a Radisson hotel in Nashua, he remained convinced that he had connected with the people in the state \u2013 and appeared to be genuinely surprised he didn\u2019t do better. It had become clear to him and his team that people had gravitated to his message. \u201cI have both won elections that I was supposed to lose and I have lost elections that I was supposed to win,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd what that means is you never know, and it\u2019s both the magic and mystery of politics that you never quite know when which is going to happen even when you think you do.\u201d For weeks as primary day approached, Christie would close his town halls with a story from one of his first events in the state. As Christie told it, he was approached by an elderly man after he wrapped up. The man was effusive in his praise for Christie. He liked what he had to say, he liked his positions and overall he was ready to vote for him. But he wouldn\u2019t, the man told Christie. Then he turned to walk away. \u201cWait \u2013 sir, tell me what I did?\u201d Christie would recount to the chuckling audience. The man turned around slowly and informed Christie he hadn\u2019t done one crucial thing: ask for the man\u2019s vote. Christie quickly did just that. The voter\u2019s response: \u201cToo late.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Prayer and political rally was sixth stop on 50-state tour Franklin Graham quotes his father Billy Graham saying nation must repent Among those sins are abortion and same-sex marriage, which he called a great sin Evangelist Franklin Graham on Wednesday urged thousands of Christians gathered near the Georgia Capitol to make their voices heard in this year\u2019s elections, saying the consequences of inaction are dire. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to make it another election cycle if we don\u2019t get God\u2019s voice back in the political arena,\u201d the reverend said after speaking to an estimated 4,500 people in Atlanta on a cold, blustery afternoon. Graham has embarked on a 50-state \u201cDecision America Tour.\u201d Atlanta was stop No. 6. Georgia's Lt. Gov. told us this was the largest crowd they have had in Liberty Plaza\u2013that's great! #DecisionAmerica pic.twitter.com/W9rjHyAV9v \u201cI want to get Christians to run for office at every level. The Christian voice needs to be heard,\u201d he said. Graham\u2019s tour has a three-fold purpose: call the nation to prayer; remind people to vote part of a Christian and civic duty; and to have people look at the election year from a spiritual standpoint. During his speech, the son of legendary evangelist Billy Graham lamented what he called the sins of the nation: abortion and same-sex marriage (which he called a great sin that has been flaunted and celebrated), and pride, materialism, racism and the Hollywood glorification of sex and violence. \u201cWe have a problem and that problem is called sin,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201c\u2026 But God loves us.\u201d In urging the crowd to vote for candidates who live biblical principals, Graham referred to something his father said in 1952. \u201cI feel that we going to have to meet our political obligations as Christians and make our voice known if America is to be preserved with the type of Christian heritage which has given us the liberties we now enjoy,\u201d Franklin Graham said, quoting his dad. \u201cFor unless America turns back to God, repents of its sin, and experiences a spiritual revival, we will fail as a nation.\u201d Graham in December said he will not endorse anyone this election but is encouraging Christians to vote for candidates that support \u201cbiblical principles, godly principles, because those principles work.\u201d .@Franklin_Graham #DecisionAmerica Tour prayer rally in Atlanta, GA.

Both women said they are still undecided on who to vote for and they liked the idea that this rally was non-partisan. \u201cFree will is very important\u201d when it comes to voting, Bearis said. Others who attended the rally worried about the recent path the country has taken. Dean Carrera of Atlanta said his concerns were for the economy and the nation\u2019s spiritual health.

            "article_content": "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knocked the rising Florida Sen. Marco Rubio down several pegs Ohio Gov. John Kasich, meanwhile, stayed with his positive game It was the revenge of the governors as Republicans met for their final debate before the Granite State\u2019s primary on Tuesday. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie knocked the rising Florida Sen. Marco Rubio down several pegs, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush went toe-to-toe with billionaire businessman Donald Trump and equaled or got the better of his nemesis. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, meanwhile, stayed with his positive game and seized opportunities to tout his own record. Here are five takeaways from Saturday night\u2019s debate on ABC as the primary clock counts down. After a stronger-than-expected third-place finish in Iowa \u2013 and taking a clear lead over other \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates \u2013 Rubio knew he\u2019d be wearing a big target Saturday night. But whether he was over-rehearsed or under-prepared, Rubio was off-key as he responded to the attacks. The opponent responsible for most of them: Christie. From the debate\u2019s outset, he pestered Rubio. \u201cYou have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable,\u201d he said. But he then opened up a brutal line of attack in suggesting that the Florida senator only knew how to turn a phrase rather than accomplish something. \u201cMarco, the thing is this,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re president of the United States, when you\u2019re a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn\u2019t solve one problem for one person.\u201d In answering Christie, Rubio consistently turned to the same talking point, casting President Barack Obama as calculating rather than incompetent, and intent on changing America for the worse. The fourth time he invoked Obama, though, the audience turned on him, booing the answer. And then moderator David Muir drove in the knife, saying: \u201cThe governor wasn\u2019t talking about the President.\u201d Rubio rebounded a bit near the debate\u2019s end, when he hammered Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for supporting abortion rights \u2013 and won applause from the audience for it. Of Democrats, Rubio said: \u201cThey are the extremists on the issue of abortion, and I can\u2019t wait to expose them in a general election.\u201d Christie, Kasich and Bush know that since they\u2019re all competing for the same pool of more moderate voters, there probably aren\u2019t enough tickets out of New Hampshire\u2019s primary for all three. But the trio were still happy to unite in attacking the senators in the race (and, in Bush\u2019s case, Trump). The only mild governor-on-governor criticism came from Christie, who noted that Kasich had increased the number of Ohio\u2019s government employees. But that followed praise of Kasich\u2019s job performance, with Christie saying he\u2019d \u201cdone a great job in Ohio.\u201d And Bush, in arguing that money and authority should shift from the federal government to the states, said: \u201cI trust Kasich and Christie to build the roads in their states.\u201d All three turned in strong performances Saturday night \u2013 and their timing couldn\u2019t have been better, given Rubio\u2019s on-stage struggles and New Hampshire\u2019s reputation for voters who make their decisions at the last minute. Kasich played up his time as the House\u2019s lead budget-writer during the surpluses of the 1990s and his record in turning a deficit into a surplus in Ohio. Bush effectively traded blows with Trump, lighting into him on eminent domain with a brutal response to the real estate mogul\u2019s accusations that Bush wanted to sound tough: \u201cHow tough is it to take property from an elderly woman?\u201d And Christie, who risked coming across as a bully in order to knock Rubio down early in the debate, was moving when he talked about drug addiction, linking his position on helping addicts to his stance opposing abortion, saying he wants to support kids after they\u2019re born as well as before. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life when they get out, and it\u2019s a lot more complicated,\u201d he said. Still, there are two big questions: Is it too little, too late? And on a Saturday night, how many New Hampshire voters were watching? They\u2019ve bashed each other on the campaign trail in recent days, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Trump \u2013 the two top-finishing candidates in Iowa\u2019s caucuses \u2013 seemed to want nothing to do with each other on the debate stage. It was one fight that was conspicuously absent Saturday night, and it contributed to Rubio\u2019s awful night. The Florida senator might have been hoping that those two would bash each other \u2013 but it didn\u2019t happen, and he clearly was Enemy No. 1. Cruz had a revealing answer when asked who he expects will win the Super Bowl: \u201cWith an eye toward February 20, Carolina,\u201d he said, alluding to the South Carolina primary. Why it matters: New Hampshire\u2019s more moderate electorate means it\u2019s not a state where Cruz is likely to shine. He could, though, win in South Carolina \u2013 and his campaign\u2019s strategy largely relies on racking up delegates in Southern states with March primaries. Trump\u2019s answers were revealing in their own way, demonstrating that his support isn\u2019t about an ideological opposition to big government as much as a desire for strength and a sense that the government is incompetent. At one point, he defended eminent domain, a practice he\u2019s used as a real estate developer. Later Trump backed the role of government-sponsored health care, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna let people die sitting in the middle of the street in any city in this country.\u201d Trump was restrained for most of the night \u2013 with the exception of a bit of audience-taunting when, during an exchange with Bush, he dismissed those booing as his donors, and with a single shot at Cruz during his closing statement (more on that later). Cruz made false claims about CNN\u2019s caucus-night reporting \u2013 and the network immediately called him on it. As caucus-goers were still voting in Iowa, Cruz\u2019s staffers had wrongly cited CNN in playing up the idea that former neurosurgeon Ben Carson was dropping out of the race. \u201cMy political team saw CNN\u2019s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers. It was being covered on live television,\u201d Cruz said Saturday. He said CNN reported that Carson was suspending his campaign \u201cfrom 6:30 p.m. to 9:15,\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t correct that story until 9:15 that night.\u201d That is untrue. \u201cWhat Senator Cruz said tonight in the debate is categorically false,\u201d CNN responded in a statement put out while the debate was in progress. \u201cCNN never corrected its reporting because CNN never had anything to correct. The Cruz campaign\u2019s actions the night of the Iowa caucuses had nothing to do with CNN\u2019s reporting. The fact that Senator Cruz continues to knowingly mislead the voters about this is astonishing.\u201d CNN had reported that Carson would continue campaigning after taking a break at home in Florida. His next stop, reporter Chris Moody said, would be Washington, D.C., for the National Prayer Breakfast. Carson passed on the opening to go after Cruz directly Saturday night: \u201cI\u2019m not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Sen. Cruz.\u201d But he did say he was \u201cvery disappointed that members of (Cruz\u2019s) team thought so little of me\u201d that they would believe he was dropping out after all the effort his campaign put into the race. He pointed to his dedicated volunteers and noted that \u201cone even died\u201d \u2013 a reference to an auto accident in which one of his supporters was killed. Trump, who\u2019d avoided Cruz all night, did take one shot at him at the debate\u2019s end. After Cruz cited his victory in Iowa during his closing statement, Trump said: \u201cThat\u2019s because you got Ben Carson\u2019s votes, by the way.\u201d Thought the 2016 debate season couldn\u2019t get any weirder? Think again. At the start of ABC\u2019s broadcast Saturday night, Carson \u2013 the second man due to appear on stage \u2013 seemed not to hear his name. So he lingered behind the curtain as other candidates, confused, walked past him. Soon, Trump \u2013 who apparently had the same problem \u2013 joined Carson in waiting. And Kasich wasn\u2019t introduced at all, until the moderators were told they\u2019d missed the Ohio governor. Moderator Martha Raddatz defused the situation by pointing to a loud and rowdy audience that made it difficult to hear. But on television, it was baffling: The names of the candidates came through loud and clear. Carson \u2013 late to the stage \u2013 quickly disappeared on it. And while he got supportive chuckles from the audience for his cracks about not getting enough air time \u2013 \u201cI thought maybe you thought already I had dropped out,\u201d he said \u2013 that\u2019s not the way to climb above his fourth-place finish in Iowa.",

Rubio, a Roman Catholic, is opposed to abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother Rubio's GOP rivals say Democrats would win women voters by citing the Florida senator's opposition to abortion in the cases of rape or incest Jeb Bush and his political allies are warning GOP voters not to get behind Marco Rubio over an unlikely issue: abortion. Rubio, a Roman Catholic, is opposed to abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. But if he were to win the nomination, Rubio\u2019s GOP rivals say, Democrats would win women voters by citing the Florida senator\u2019s opposition to abortion in the cases of rape or incest. The attack highlights how the candidates vying for the GOP\u2019s establishment mantle are trying to convince moderate voters to reject the surging candidate starting Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary \u2013 even though Rubio\u2019s position is in line with many social conservatives. After Bush raised the issue Friday, his allies pushed on the matter just hours before Saturday\u2019s GOP debate. In a CNN interview after a Bush rally in Bedford, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Rubio\u2019s position is emblematic of Republicans Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana, who lost Senate races in 2012 because of gaffes over their hardline abortion positions. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life. The most tragic thing in the world is for a woman to be raped, a child, a pregnancy caused by rape. I\u2019m very pro-life, (but) I can\u2019t go there, I can\u2019t tell that woman you gotta carry that child,\u201d said Graham, a leading Bush surrogate. \u201cI\u2019m very pro-life, that\u2019s a sensitive issue, but I think in a general election that will be a hard sell.\u201d Graham added: \u201cHe has no exceptions for rape or incest. Now, I respect the passion there but most Americans have a hard time going there.\u201d On Friday, Bush made similar comments to CNN. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s a tough sell to tell a pro-life mother \u2013 had her daughter been raped \u2013 that she would just have to accept that as a sad fact,\u201d Bush told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel. \u201cThis is not an easy decision, but Marco will have to explain that position.\u201d Rubio spokesman Alex Conant referred an inquiry to comments the candidate made earlier this week after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also attacked the senator on the issue. Rubio has said he would sign legislation to ban abortion even if such a measure included all three exceptions. But he reiterated that he is only personally in favor of an exception to save the life of the mother. \u201cI\u2019m proudly pro-life, and I won\u2019t apologize for being pro-life,\u201d Rubio told reporters this week in Manchester. \u201cI understand it\u2019s a difficult issue. When you find yourself in a crisis pregnancy, that\u2019s a very difficult situation. But I have to choose between the right of a person to do with their body with the right of an unborn child to live. And I choose to support the right of an unborn child to live.\u201d Rubio added he\u2019d win a general election argument over the topic with Hillary Clinton because, he said, she\u2019s an \u201cextremist\u201d on the issue given her support for abortion even late in a pregnancy.",

            "article_content": "Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker will endorse Chris Christie's presidential bid on Friday The two are scheduled to attend a Bruce Springsteen concert together in Boston on Thursday night Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker will endorse Chris Christie on Friday, according to people familiar with his plans, giving a boost to the New Jersey governor\u2019s presidential campaign just four days from the crucial New Hampshire primary. After his endorsement, Baker will campaign with Christie in New Hampshire over the weekend, the people said. In Baker, Christie gains the support of a popular northeastern Republican governor the campaign hopes will punch momentum into a contest that he has referred to as the \u201clast stand\u201d of his presidential campaign. Baker joins Maine Gov. Paul LePage as statewide office holders who have gotten behind Christie\u2019s bid. Sam Smith, a Christie spokeswoman, declined to comment on the endorsement. Tim Buckley, a Baker spokesman, didn\u2019t respond to repeated calls requesting comment. Christie has tried to lock down Baker\u2019s for months, according to people familiar with the matter. The two became close during Baker\u2019s 2014 run for the governor\u2019s office, when he flipped the state back into the Republican column with the help of $11.4 million from the Christie-run Republican Governor\u2019s Association. Christie attended Baker\u2019s inauguration and aides say the two, as Republican governors in traditionally Democratic states, have remained closely aligned over the last year. They were at a Bruce Springsteen concert together in Boston on Thursday night. Baker provides a window into what Christie is counting on if he can achieve a strong showing in New Hampshire: the support \u2013 and access to \u2013 the finance networks of the governors he helped win election or re-election during his time atop the RGA. Baker has his own robust finance operation, raising $2.4 million in his first year in office, according to the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance. He is expected now to try and help steer those donors toward Christie. \u201cWe have the organization of governors across this country,\u201d Christie told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI believe that when I emerge as the top governor from New Hampshire, that those governors will come in line and begin to support the idea of having a governor\u201d as GOP candidate. For Christie, who has staked his campaign on his New Hampshire performance, Baker\u2019s endorsement adds a boost to an operation that is relying on a top tier performance in the state to vault Christie into the top tier of GOP candidates coming going into the South Carolina primary. Christie sank to 4% in the latest CNN/WMUR New Hampshire tracking poll, falling behind Donald Trump, surging Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Christie himself has spent more than 70 days in New Hampshire this election cycle and has held more than 150 events. Polls showed that work paid was paying off earlier this year, as Christie began a steady climb into the top tier of candidates not named Trump. But that rise also drew the attention of his competitors and three weeks and million of dollars in attack ads later, Christie has seen his unfavorability ratings rise in the state and his poll numbers settle into the mid-single digits. Christie has spent the last few weeks pointing out that the numbers have been fluid throughout the state \u2013 on any given day, any of the so-called \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates in the race are up or down \u2013 and that the polls are unreliable. Nearly 60 percent of likely Republican voters hadn\u2019t firmly decided on a candidate in the CNN/WMUR poll. An open primary adds another potential surprise element into the mix. Yet Christie has faced a new challenge in the final days before New Hampshire in the rise of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has used a stronger-than-expected showing Iowa to bolster his own chances in the state. Christie has spent much of this week attacking Rubio, calling him inexperienced and seeking to peg him as too conservative on abortion for the New Hampshire electorate. Still, even with the steady barrage of Rubio attacks, Christie and his team are sticking to the metric of success as finishing first among the governors \u2013 Christie, Bush and Kasich.",

            "article_content": "Evangelicals are among the most reliable caucus-goers every four years They're torn between choosing Donald Trump, Ted Cruz The final days before the first-in-the-nation caucuses are agonizing for many Iowa evangelicals as they waver between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. At events for both GOP presidential candidates across the Hawkeye state, voters say they are torn between backing the committed Christian conservative who is solid on their principles, or the once-liberal, thrice-married candidate who they believe would make the stronger president. Sherry Benson, a 57-year-old graphic designer from Marshalltown, said she is still trying to come to terms with Trump\u2019s evolution on abortion. Benson calls abortion \u201cthe biggest sin of our country.\u201d The anti-Trump television ads detailing his shifts\u2014with arresting clips of the candidate talking about his support for abortion in 1999\u2014have kept that issue fresh on her mind. Moments from Ted Cruz's career \u201cIt\u2019s been a really, really big struggle for me this time,\u201d Benson said after listening to Trump speak at a rally last week. \u201cI think people can change, but I don\u2019t see him as the biggest conservative.\u201d Still, Trump\u2019s forceful personality has convinced her that he could be effective as commander-in-chief. Donald Trump: Ted Cruz is an \u2018anchor baby\u2019 \u201cMy Christianity and my conservative values tell me that Cruz is the logical choice,\u201d she said. \u201cI could forgo, I think, some of my Christian and conservative principles slightly if I knew that Trump could repair the mess that the country is in. And that is something that I see in him, he might have the ability to just \u2013 \u2018Boom\u2019 \u2013 take care of things very quickly.\u201d Retired schoolteacher Paul Thompson, 75, ranks Cruz at the top of his list because \u201che is an evangelical Christian, as I am,\u201d he said. But he too is feeling the gravitational pull to Trump\u2019s candidacy. Thompson had a simple answer when asked to explain why Trump, a Presbyterian, is leading among evangelicals in some polls given his personal history and changing stances over the years. \u201cWe want to see a winner, and I think we perceive him as a winner,\u201d he said. Cruz has worked diligently for months to court evangelical voters, who often show up in droves every four years to caucus for Republicans. That decision for many evangelicals between head and heart could very well decide who wins Iowa on Monday night after a tight race between the Texas senator and the real estate magnate. The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll released Saturday evening found Trump leading Cruz 28% to 23%. How Trump and Cruz went from Ivy League to anti-establishment While many had assumed that Cruz would have a lock on white evangelical voters, particularly as support for retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson has waned, Trump has shown surprising strength within that voter group. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Thursday, Trump notched the support of 31% of evangelical Christians to Cruz\u2019s 28%. But in a poll of likely Iowa caucus participants released earlier by Quinnipiac University, Cruz led Trump among white born-again evangelicals 34% to 27%. Nationally, Trump was leading Cruz among GOP evangelicals 39% to 25%, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. Rubio: 'No one is unbeatable' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s efforts to reach evangelicals also appear to be paying dividends after a month in which he has emphasized his faith. Though Rubio is far behind Trump and Cruz in Iowa polls, a number of evangelicals mentioned him as their third choice in interviews over the past week and he is rising in the polls. Evangelical voters are the most reliable bloc of caucus-goers on the Republican side and they have had outsized influence in past election cycles. In 2012, some 57% of voters entering the Iowa caucuses in 2012 described themselves as evangelical Christians, according to polling by the Pew Research Center\u2014and they helped Rick Santorum narrowly edge out Mitt Romney in Iowa, just as they helped former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee four years earlier. READ: Cruz targets Rubio ahead of Iowa caucuses With that history in mind, Cruz allies have pummeled Trump over the past week as a political opportunist who cannot be trusted, given his past positions on issues like partial birth abortion. Cruz doesn't view any state as a 'must-win' One blistering ad from a super PAC supporting Cruz described Trump as \u201cextreme\u201d on abortion and used a video clip from a 1999 interview where \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Tim Russert asked whether a \u201cPresident Trump\u201d would ban \u201cpartial birth abortion.\u201d The ad shows part of Trump\u2019s answer \u2013 \u201cI am pro-choice in every respect.\u201d It is not just Trump\u2019s past statements that are at issue. When asked about his faith, voters here sometimes bring up Trump\u2019s embarrassing gaffe at Liberty University where he quoted from \u201cTwo Corinthians\u201d instead of \u201cSecond Corinthians,\u201d or the event in Ames last year where he said he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever sought forgiveness from God. Trump went a long way to buttressing his credibility by winning an endorsement from evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, though Falwell\u2019s decision caused an uproar within the Liberty University alumni community. Falwell doubled down on his endorsement Saturday night as he appeared with Trump on the campaign trail. His praise was effusive \u2013 at times almost fawning \u2013 as he essentially told the Davenport crowd that he was willing to take the heat over his decision. Trump, he said at least twice, reminded him of his father, the famed televangelist and Southern Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell Sr. He cited private acts of generosity that he said Trump does not typically boast about \u2013 from financial assistance that he said the mogul offered to a couple who helped him with his broken-down limousine to his aid for an inner city basketball team. Trump: Ted Cruz is an anchor baby By way of explaining his endorsement of Trump, Falwell noted that any parent who had a sick child would seek the best doctor they could find. \u201cIt may not be a doctor who goes to your church, but it\u2019s the one who has the most experience with that particular illness,\u201d he said. His father, he added, \u201cwas criticized in the late 1970s, early \u201980s, because he supported Ronald Reagan, a Hollywood actor who had been divorced and remarried, over Jimmy Carter, who was a Sunday school teacher \u2013 a southern Baptist Sunday school teacher,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cYou know, I think he made the right decision. He explained that when he went into the voting booth, he wasn\u2019t trying to elect a Sunday school teacher, or pastor, or even somebody who shared his theological beliefs,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cHe was trying to elect the most qualified person to be the president of the United States. We know Jimmy Carter was a great Sunday school teacher; but look how he did as President.\u201d READ: Campaigns lower expectations in Iowa, brace for Trump win Trump went a step further on Saturday by releasing a closing message to evangelicals on Facebook, showing the Bible that his mother had given him and thanking conservative Christians for supporting him. \u201cMy mother gave me this Bible, this very Bible, many years ago. In fact it\u2019s her writing right here. She wrote the name and my address, and it\u2019s just very special to me,\u201d Trump said in the Facebook video. \u201cAnd again, I want to thank the evangelicals. I will never let you down.\u201d But that\u2019s still an open question for some evangelicals here. Seventeen-year-old David Blom said he went to a Trump event last week, in part, to try to get a better sense of the authenticity of his faith. Trump deflects on the abortion question \u201cJust listening to the language from Trump tonight, he said \u2018terminated\u2019 instead of \u2018killed\u2019 when he was talking about life,\u201d said Blom, who has trained other students at his school to caucus (many, he said, are leaning toward Trump or Cruz). \u201cHe makes fun of the media, but then he uses the pro-choice, and pro-abortion term instead of what an Iowa evangelical would see as being a person of life and value.\u201d \u201cLife is super important and we can\u2019t have a new convert leading the pro-life movement as the Republican nominee,\u201d the high school senior said. Surrogates for Cruz have traveled the state emphasizing Cruz\u2019s consistency on social issues like marriage, abortion and religious liberty. READ: Main Cruz super PACs struggled to raise money in fall and winter \u201cTed Cruz is going to be the same today as he was yesterday, as he will be tomorrow,\u201d former Texas Gov. Rick Perry told voters at a Cruz event in Albia. On Saturday, the head of the Cruz campaign\u2019s \u201c99 Pastors\u201d group, Pastor Joseph Brown, penned an email to more than 150 pastors across Iowa encouraging them to \u201cprepare to challenge and equip your people for the Iowa Caucus taking place on Monday.\u201d The message was heeded at Lutheran Church of Hope in West Des Moines Sunday morning, where Cruz attended services with his family. Iowa congressman Steve King, who traveled the state on Cruz\u2019s behalf last week, predicted that some evangelical voters enamored by Trump will ultimately flip back to Cruz. \u201cTwo thirds of the people who will come to caucus are full spectrum constitutional Christian conservatives. They are pro-life, they are pro-marriage, they are pro-religious liberty, they\u2019re pro-Second Amendment, they are pro-free enterprise and for a strong national defense,\u201d King said. \u201cThey know what they believe in and they\u2019ve been for three generations bringing their children up to caucus because it\u2019s part of their tradition.\u201d Those voters, he argued, \u201care very uneasy about Trump\u2026. They don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do next.\u201d That is one reason that VanWeelden, a 73-year-old pastor from rural Albia, decided on Cruz. \u201cHe speaks from his heart. He is not an act,\u201d he said. While Trump\u2019s taunting jabs at other candidates have amused some GOP voters, they are not in keeping with the language of a man who lives by his Christian faith.\u201d \u201cI like Donald Trump in the way that he\u2019s not a politician,\u201d VanWeelden went on. \u201cWe need somebody that\u2019s strong and stands by what he says, but I do believe you don\u2019t need to slander people to get there.\u201d Christians, he noted, are \u201ctaught to love our fellow man, not to run him into the ground or condemn him\u2026. Grace is treating everybody with respect and working with them.\u201d Put the CNN election center to work on your device. Get the CNN app.",

            "article_content": "Want to sound like a true politician? Master these 10 phrases \"The only poll that counts is the one on Election Day\" Late in the most recent Republican presidential debate, Chris Christie chided his rivals for using clich\u00e9s, jargon and other forms of politician-speak. \u201cI feel like I need a Washington-to-English dictionary converter,\u201d declared the New Jersey governor. Christie was right, even if he did have a self-interest in coming off as the blunt-spoken truth teller of the field at the debate. In the waning hours before Iowa Caucus votes come in, here are some of the well-worn and tired phrases candidates and pundits are using: Perhaps the most tired of political clich\u00e9s, it\u2019s the standard spin move of candidates who trail in polls. Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina used a version of it in the January 28 undercard debate. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my faith every single time not in the pundits, not in the polls,\u201d said the former tech executive. The clich\u00e9 has actually taken a beating in political circles for its ubiquity. A turning point came in December 2014 just before the Louisiana Senate runoff. The incumbent, Democrat Mary Landrieu, trailing badly in the polls, took heat for saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over. The only poll that matters is on Election Day.\u201d She lost in that poll as well. Yes, it does. But that doesn\u2019t make this any less of a clich\u00e9. NBC\u2019s First Read wrote recently, \u201cYes, this is a clich\u00e9 \u2013 but it\u2019s also true: Trump and Sanders need a new turnout to win Iowa, while Clinton and Cruz need a traditional turnout. That\u2019s what all of the polling backs up.\u201d Sanders himself agrees. \u201cWe will win the caucus on Monday night if there is a large voter turnout,\u201d he told a group of campaign volunteers Saturday. \u201cWe will lose if there is a low voter turnout,\u201d he reiterated all day Saturday. Politician-speak for somebody they often can\u2019t stand. \u201cMy good friend\u201d is used most commonly on the House or Senate floors in thinly veiled efforts to mask contempt for colleagues under the guise of decorum. (Really hate someone? Try \u201cmy very good friend, the distinguished gentleman.\u201d) Calling someone a \u201cfriend\u201d on the campaign trail is generally not a sign things are going well. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush deployed it against his prot\u00e9g\u00e9-turned-presidential rival, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. \u201cMarco\u2019s a friend but Americans are looking for a leader,\u201d Bush wrote in an email to Breitbart News after the January 28 debate. On the Democratic side, Sanders used my good friend as a jab against two targets simultaneously. \u201cIn terms of polling, guess what?\u201d Sanders said at the January 17 Democratic debate. \u201cWe are running ahead of Secretary Clinton in terms of taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that I saw.\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz even sent out a last-minute fundraising pitch referring to rival Trump as his friend. \u201cWhen I first announced my campaign, Heidi and I committed that we would run an issues oriented, positive campaign,\u201d Cruz wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, my friend, Donald Trump, didn\u2019t make that same commitment. Presidential candidates frequently describe their humble beginnings to show they\u2019re worthy of the nation\u2019s high office. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the most persistent. At every turn on the 2016 campaign trail Kasich notes that he\u2019s the son of a mailman. Several of Kasich\u2019s Republican rivals have their own oft-old stories about being son of a something-or-other. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s father was a bartender and his mother a maid, he reminds audiences. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas frequently refers to his preacher father. Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania adds a twist with recollections of his coal miner grandfather. A politicians\u2019 euphemism to explain their shifts on issues when it becomes politically convenient. President Barack Obama famously \u201cevolved\u201d into supporting same-sex marriage, and now Trump is relying on it to explain his shift on abortion. The mogul has been chided by opponents repeatedly for a 1999 statement on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d about his views on abortion: \u201cI am pro-choice in every respect.\u201d Speaking in Iowa on January 26 Trump explained, \u201cWhen it comes to pro-life, I\u2019ve evolved.\u201d A forward-looking phrase likely to appeal to partisans most likely to vote in party caucuses and primaries. Clinton is leaning on the phrase particularly hard as she fends off a stronger-than-expected Democratic primary challenge from Sanders. At CNN\u2019s Iowa Democratic town hall on January 25, the former secretary of state, senator and first lady sought to portray Sanders as out-of-touch on the reality of actually getting progressive ideas enacted into law. Clinton repeatedly called herself a \u201cproven fighter.\u201d \u201cThey throw all this stuff at me, and I\u2019m still standing,\u201d Clinton said about Republican opponent, past and present, adding that the attacks come \u201cbecause I\u2019ve been on the front lines of change and progress.\u201d A candidate attempt to deflect attention away from an unflattering topic to one they want to discuss. Nobody\u2019s done it more than Cruz. The Texas senator used it to push back against queries over unreported loans to his 2012 Senate campaign from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. When asked by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash how the loans from the big banks squared with his populist image, Cruz responded, \u201cThe premise of your question is not right.\u201d Chris Christie\u2019s picking up on it, too. In the January 28 debate the New Jersey governor disputed a question from FOX News moderator Megyn Kelly with: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is your premise in the question.\u201d A common description by politicians and supporters about a campaign\u2019s own proposals. It manages to be a punchy, optimistic-sounding break with conventional thinking and deliberately vague all at once. Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee used it in the January 28 undercard debate. \u201cI talked about the importance of preserving life, of not just saying we\u2019re going to defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d the former Arkansas governor said. \u201cBut let\u2019s do something bolder. Let\u2019s get rid of abortion once and for all by applying the Fifth, and Fourteenth amendment to every person from conception.\u201d On the other end of the political spectrum, Sanders used the most recent Democratic debate to talk up his democratic socialist economic plan. \u201cBottom line is, we need to be bold and decisive, we can create millions of jobs,\u201d he said. And on climate change, \u201cIf we do not act boldly and decisively, a bad situation will become worse.\u201d Every politician, even the ones in complete disagreement, claims to speak for the American people. It\u2019s a favorite in House and Senate floor debate and virtually every congressional news conference. And arguably more so in the 2016 presidential race. Three of the seven Republican candidates on the main January 28 debate stage claimed to know what the American people wanted in the election \u2013 Marco Rubio, Chris Christie and Ben Carson. Rubio used it four times in the span of a few minutes. The very thing most presidential candidates claim not to be even when their bio clearly states otherwise. \u201cI am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington,\u201d Ted Cruz said at the January 28 Republican debate. Even though he\u2019s a sitting senator for three years, albeit an unpopular one with Capitol Hill colleagues. Carly Fiorina tried that tack, as well, at the undercard debate. Virtually all of Cruz\u2019s rival have used similar rhetoric, despite long careers in elected office. About the only GOP hopeful proud to be a career politician is Ohio Gov. Kasich, whose stump speech touts his 18 years in Congress and current statehouse tenure.",

            "article_content": "The New York Times endorsed John Kasich for the GOP nomination Saturday Kasich's campaign is based on his winning New Hampshire, where he has spent most of his time \u201cWe\u2019re coming up!\u201d John Kasich yelled over his shoulder as he made for the exit after his 82nd New Hampshire town hall wrapped up in Amherst on Tuesday. He was talking to Arnie Arnesen, a progressive radio show host and longtime activist from Concord who followed him back in 1999 when he first considered running for president. The two had just shared a quick hug. \u201cThis was an appeal to un-declareds. It was untarnished.\u201d Arnesen said of Kasich\u2019s stump speech with a smile after he left. \u201cIt was the positive message that you kind of like but aren\u2019t sure is going to resonate in this campaign.\u201d With less than two weeks to go before the first-in-the-nation primary Kasich has honed a message that is relentlessly positive, with an urgency that is sometimes disarming. It\u2019s a message that has won him support among voices like The New York Times, which announced its endorsement of Kasich Saturday. \u201cGov. John Kasich of Ohio, though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race. And Mr. Kasich is no moderate. As governor, he\u2019s gone after public-sector unions, fought to limit abortion rights and opposed same-sex marriage,\u201d reads the editorial. New York Times endorses Hillary Clinton, John Kasich for nominations When asked if an endorsement from the paper, known for its stereotypically liberal readership, would help him with Republican voters Kasich told reporters it was about bringing people together. \u201cWhen people like The New York Times say, \u2018This is a guy that can bring people together and solve problems,\u2019 I\u2019d like to know how that\u2019s not helpful. I think it\u2019s really helpful.\u201d He also tweeted his thanks to the newspaper. Proud to have the support of the @nytimes - Together we can make America safer & stronger -John #Kasich4Us pic.twitter.com/VfVRAOst72 Kasich has bet his candidacy on the small state of New Hampshire, spending more time here than any other candidate, according to New England Channel News\u2019 candidate tracker. He left Iowa four days before the caucus there for a final 11-day swing leading up to New Hampshire\u2019s primary. Arnesen bets that undeclared voters could be just the edge he\u2019s looking for against the other \u201cgoverning\u201d candidates, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. In New Hampshire \u201cundeclared\u201d voters represent more than 40% of the state\u2019s voters and can choose to vote in either party\u2019s primary on Election Day, although many of them consistently lean to one party. A recent poll from WBUR shows around one third of undeclared voters have yet to decide on a party for the February 9 primary. Arnesen thinks that Donald Trump\u2019s dominance in the race has actually been a blessing-of-sorts for Kasich, scooping up hard line anti-establishment and conservative voters and leaving truly independent voters looking for a centrist candidate with experience. It\u2019s a theory the campaign doesn\u2019t discourage. Kasich has recently shown a spike in polls in the state and has picked up a string of endorsements from newspapers known for supporting centrist Republican candidates, such as the Times, Concord Monitor, the Boston Globe and the Keene Sentinel. The latest public poll from Suffolk University shows him tied for second place with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. However other polls show Kasich tied with a cluster of candidates including Cruz, Bush, Christie and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio vying for space below front-runner Donald Trump, many within the margin of error of one another. Kasich seemed cheery and comfortable in Amherst as he fielded questions and interacted with voters, telling the crowd that some candidates can yell or blame others but that he wants \u201cto live on the sunny side of the street.\u201d When asked to contrast himself with other candidates by a voter (\u201cChristie and the other guy\u2026. Bush\u201d) Kasich said \u201cno\u201d before turning to his record in Ohio. \u201cI\u2019m an Independent guy, the Republican party is my vehicle but it has never been my master,\u201d Kasich told a town hall audience in Keene Saturday. \u201cBut I am a conservative who believes that conservative principles can help us to rise,\u201d Kasich added. \u201cPeople who may not think exactly the way that I do that want to come and play in the orchestra they\u2019re all going to be welcome.\u201d As Kasich has shown movement in polling groups supporting other candidates have hammered him with ads and mailers attacking him for being too liberal on policies like Medicare and Common Core. But several voters at Kasich\u2019s event told CNN those positions didn\u2019t bother them. Mary Epstein, 56, was one of the first voters to walk into Kasich\u2019s Amherst town hall and told CNN she identifies as Independent. She voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012 (\u201cbig mistake\u201d) but is not considering Democratic candidates this year. She was leaning heavily towards Kasich and was seeing him for the second time to lock it in. \u201cHe reminds me of Jon Huntsman and I liked him,\u201d Epstein said, tying Kasich to the moderate Republican presidential candidate who dropped out after finishing third in New Hampshire four years ago. \u201cI think he\u2019s very practical, and he seems to have a plan.\u201d In Amherst, Kasich fielded one question on his support for Common Core standards by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that really means, let me tell you what I\u2019m for, in my state I\u2019m for high standards and a curriculum set by local school boards.\u201d Another voter asked him for advice to give the state legislature on trying to expand Medicare. Kasich said he wasn\u2019t so sure they wanted his advice, but said he did it in Ohio to bring back money \u201cwe send\u201d to Washington for treating the mentally ill and drug addicted in Ohio. Kasich\u2019s campaign acknowledges the candidate\u2019s appeal to moderate voters but says they are competitive among a spectrum of conservative voters as well. Steve Richardson, 77, of Bedford, is a registered Republican and is considering the more conservative Cruz, though he was leaning towards Kasich and was sitting in the front row in Amherst. He told CNN he wasn\u2019t bothered by many of the recent attacks. \u201cWell you know you\u2019re never going to get any one candidate that fulfills all your desires,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI think it means a lot, what you\u2019ve done, you can say anything but what you\u2019ve done is what really counts I think.\u201d Put the CNN election center to work on your device.

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz's allies are citing his Latino heritage as a possible general election benefit The candidate is stressing his electability against a Democratic opponent Conservative radio personality Glenn Beck was giving Ted Cruz his highest-profile endorsement in months: Cruz was a Lincoln. A Washington. A Reagan. A conservative icon of his generation. And a Latino. \u201cI have officially endorsed Ted Cruz to become the first Hispanic-American president, to become the first first-generation American president,\u201d Beck said Saturday to building applause here as Cruz came onto the stage. Those are words Cruz does not say himself. In the homestretch here in Iowa, Cruz is beginning to tout that he\u2019s more electable in November than Trump is against Hillary Clinton. But missing from Cruz\u2019s pitch, to the consternation of some top Republicans in his orbit, is any mention of his ethnicity, perhaps one of Cruz\u2019s greatest selling points. Cruz\u2019s super PAC, Keep the Promise, has long believed that Cruz holds tremendous general election potential as a Latino candidate \u2013 especially in swing states like Florida, Colorado and Nevada. While Cruz regularly weaves his speeches with the emotional story of his father\u2019s escape from Cuba, he says he does not believe in the identity politics he claims is popular with Democrats, and he has described his evangelical faith and his conservative political philosophy as far more guiding principles in his life than his ethnic background. And he almost never speaks Spanish on the trail, unlike the other Cuban-American candidate, Marco Rubio. \u201cQue bueno!\u201d Cruz replied to four Cuban immigrants shouting out to him at a stop last week in Plymouth, New Hampshire. Cruz wanted to know where they came from: \u201cDe donde?\u201d RELATED: Cruz, two super PACs hit Trump on abortion, \u2018New York values\u2019 In a detailed, 50-slide PowerPoint presentation that Cruz\u2019s close friend, Toby Neugebauer, used to pitch Cruz donors on the super PAC, Cruz\u2019s heritage was a main answer to the question posed in the presentation\u2019s title: \u201cCan he win?\u201d On the slide, \u201cRepublican Must Do\u2019s for 2016,\u201d Neugebauer wrote that the party must \u201cperform better with Latino voters in Florida, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada,\u201d \u2013 and that Cruz, as a Hispanic presidential contender, could. That presentation, first reported by CNN this summer, was recently removed from the Keep the Promise website. But even in the now-retooled digital presence, Cruz\u2019s Hispanic background continues to be a calling card for his candidacy \u2013 at least in the eyes of his big-money super PAC backers. \u201cTed has a history of connecting with Hispanic voters. In his run for Texas senator he garnered 40% of the Hispanic vote,\u201d the brief \u201cWhy Ted\u201d page reads. \u201cTo win a swing state like Florida, Ted would need to receive 66% of the Cuban vote. Considering Ted himself is of Cuban descent, winning key swing states with large Hispanic populations is feasible.\u201d Jim Budde, who runs Cruz\u2019s campaign in Iowa\u2019s rural Jasper County, said he frequently encounters Iowans at the door worried \u201cright away\u201d about Cruz\u2019s ability to win in November. And he argued that Cruz\u2019s Hispanic background would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be an asset in that general election. \u201cYou sure can\u2019t come after the Republicans anymore as being all about the old white people,\u201d Budde said. RELATED: Cruz: Trump \u2018could be unstoppable\u2019 if he wins Iowa Part of the reason why Cruz has not emphasized his Hispanic heritage is that he fundamentally disagrees with the need to woo typically liberal voting blocs. The senator has long held that the way to win a general election is to all but ignore moderates and instead energize the restless GOP base. And if Cruz is attempting to appeal to any Democratic constituency in particular, it is not Latinos, but white, working-class Catholics, or \u201cReagan Democrats,\u201d that Cruz says in recent interviews could help him win states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Cruz, meanwhile, has been making the electability pitch to voters in Iowa, wielding horse race polling and donation histories to argue that Trump could not present a strong general-election contrast with Clinton. Trump has trailed much of the GOP field in early head-to-head polling against Clinton and Bernie Sanders, with the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal survey last week showing Clinton beating Trump by 10 points but only Cruz by 4. That worry raises the stakes for what happens here in Iowa next week. Beck warned a Cruz crowd here that if Trump wins the nomination, Democrats would \u201cpick his bones apart and destroy him.\u201d And given Trump\u2019s dominance in later states, Cruz in Iowa is the Republican Party\u2019s best chance to avoid that. Beck said the GOP race \u201cmight be\u201d over if Trump beats Cruz here on Monday \u2013 meaning a Democrat takes the White House. \u201cIf you have the image of win, win, win,\u201d Beck told reporters, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen really quickly.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Watch CNN\u2019s Democratic Presidential Town Hall with candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley broadcast live from Iowa on Monday at 9 p.m. ET Bernie Sanders used the 43rd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision Friday to tell his supporters here he's not just fighting for income equality -- he also supports women's rights The attacks have grown sharper between Clinton and Sanders in recent weeks Under fire from Hillary Clinton and her supporters for dubbing Planned Parenthood a member of the \u201cestablishment,\u201d Bernie Sanders used the 43rd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision Friday to tell his supporters here he\u2019s not just fighting for income equality \u2013 he also supports women\u2019s rights. Speaking to students packed into the auditorium at Concord High School, the Vermont senator took on a professorial tone, laying out the creation of American democracy, but he kept circling back to the fight for women\u2019s rights. \u201cWhat Roe v. Wade was about is that women and their male allies were saying, \u2018You know what, on these issues, it should be with the individual, the woman, the family, the doctor, to make these decisions and not the government. That\u2019s a choice for a woman,\u2019\u201d Sanders said to cheers from the crowd, many of whom are not yet old enough yet to vote for him here in two weeks. As the race has tightened in Iowa and Sanders has opened up a massive lead in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign and its supporters have been searching for any opening on their surprisingly resilient opponent. They found an opportunity earlier this week when Sanders lumped Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign \u2013 two powerhouse groups on the left that recently endorsed Clinton \u2013 in with the \u201cestablishment.\u201d Clinton fired back almost immediately, hitting the Vermont senator on Twitter for seeming to liken the two groups to Wall Street and Washington elites. So Sanders used the anniversary of the landmark decision to remind his supporters he\u2019s on board with women, too. The first question he took from the crowd of Concord students was about how he would support Planned Parenthood if elected president. \u201cI would expand funding for Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said to cheers. The attacks have grown sharper between Clinton and Sanders in recent weeks, with Iowa and New Hampshire on the line. Whereas the two previously declined to call each other out by name, they have now dropped those pretenses. But it\u2019s unclear how much, if any of it, is getting through to the voters. As Cheryl Simmers and Cathy Kilday, both special education teachers at Concord High School, sat near the front of the auditorium and waited for Sanders to arrive, they pondered the most recent spat between Clinton and Sanders. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s behind it all,\u201d said Simmers, 56, of Concord. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the truth is and I don\u2019t, as a regular citizen, know how to find that information out. Is (the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws), is Planned Parenthood all backed by money or is it backed by legitimately concerned individuals?\u201d Simmers is still deciding between Clinton and Sanders \u2013 she likes Sanders\u2019 willingness to take on the establishment, but she wasn\u2019t pleased when he yelled over Clinton at the fourth Democratic debate earlier this week. Kilday said she is almost 100% behind Sanders, but also said she has not completely made up her mind on both this fight and on the election. \u201cI\u2019m a little torn with that because Hillary went to Wellesley (College). That\u2019s where I went to school,\u201d said Kilday, 55, who also lives in Concord. \u201cSo on a gut level, I\u2019d like to believe that she would always be the honest go-to for women\u2019s rights rather than establishment.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There are plenty of presidential candidates nobody has heard of They just gathered in New Hampshire Crammed onto a small stage at a college in New Hampshire, the presidential candidates gathered for their moment in the spotlight, broadcast to the nation on C-SPAN. There were Democrats like Henry Hewes, who\u2019s running on an anti-abortion agenda, libertarian-esque Mark Stewart, a self-described \u201cbetter feminist than Hillary Clinton,\u201d union activist Raymond Michael Moroz, and William McGaughey, who said he \u201cdecided to run as a Democrat partly on the issue of dignity for white people.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m also for a shorter work week,\u201d McGaughey said. Nearly 30 presidential candidates you\u2019ve never heard of and who won\u2019t be president anytime soon gathered for a public forum here Tuesday, fulfilling a long-held tradition in the first-in-the-nation primary state. Every four years, these largely unknown presidential candidates flock to New Hampshire, where $1,000 buys you a spot on the primary ballot. These \u201clesser-knowns,\u201d as they are affectionately called, can thrive here because of the state\u2019s small size and the heavy population of national media that descend to cover the presidential election. This year, including the mainstream candidates who appear on nationally televised debates, 58 people will be on the ballot in New Hampshire. Most never get a chance to broadcast their campaign message. But for a few hours, huddled before a small audience at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, the group of candidates \u2013 all men this year \u2013 had their say in front of the TV cameras. The Republican side included Andy Martin, who helped propel the \u201cbirther movement\u201d which claimed \u2013 erroneously \u2013 that President Barack Obama was ineligible to be president. Martin, by the way, is hosting a forum in Washington to investigate fellow Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz\u2019s eligibility. Tim Cook, a candidate from North Carolina, bemoaned the fact that not all candidates for president are included in most national polls. \u201cSomeone is cherry-picking the candidates for voters, and that\u2019s un-American,\u201d Cook said, adding that he had done his own poll on Twitter, and found that he would have beaten Hillary Clinton. Not everyone lesser-known candidate is welcome. Conspicuously absent from the forum this year was a reliable mainstay of New Hampshire politics, presidential candidate and performance artist Vermin Supreme, who runs each cycle on the promise of providing free ponies for all Americans. At the last lesser-known candidate debate in 2011, he stood up and poured glitter over the head of one of his competitors in order to, in his words, \u201cmake him gay.\u201d CNN's 2012 profile of Vermin Supreme, the protester who would be president Supreme was barred from the forum this year for \u201cproperty damage\u201d and relegated to a zone surrounded by police tape outside the debate hall, where he stood with two toy ponies, a campaign sign painted onto a boogie board and a giant boot on his head. While many of the candidates conceded that they knew they had less than an outside chance of ever residing in the White House, the forum offered a chance for these contenders \u2013 in a campaign environment that makes it nearly impossible for the average person to realistically have hope of winning \u2013 to get their message out. \u201cNew Hampshire really plays a critical role in allowing lesser-known candidates to express their views, said Jon Adams, a Democrat. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason at all that any one or two candidates that are at the table right now couldn\u2019t jump into the top tier and become a top candidate.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Henry Hewes\u2019 name.",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz is taking a harsher tone against front-runner Donald Trump Cruz is looking for win in S.C. after Iowa, New Hampshire Ted Cruz\u2019s team has a theory about how the next four weeks will go: He will edge out Donald Trump in Iowa, suffer a drubbing to him eight days later in New Hampshire, and then by the third week in February, actually be locked in the \u201ctwo-man race\u201d that he today confidently predicts the election has already entered. Then, here in the Palmetto State, his path to the Republican nomination will be cemented. \u201cIn most prior elections, Iowa and New Hampshire split. They go for different candidates,\u201d Cruz said Saturday in a college auditorium here in the ruby red Upstate region. \u201cSouth Carolina historically has had the role of picking presidents.\u201d If Cruz predicts that the series will be tied as he and Trump clear the field, South Carolina is being envisioned as the rubber match, the moment when Republicans are forced to decide between two self-stylized conservatives who have deep \u2013 but not dominant \u2013 appeal. Moments from Ted Cruz's career Adopting a mocking, sardonic tone toward Trump that would\u2019ve been unthinkable even a week ago, Cruz presented South Carolina Republicans with the outline of what is likely to be his argument up until they head to the polls on Feb. 20. Even if Trump appeals to your heart and your emotions, Cruz told audiences in ways both stark and veiled, you need to vet him carefully. \u201cAny candidate on that stage, no matter how much you like them when they\u2019re campaigning, if they haven\u2019t stood and fought,\u201d Cruz told a Tea Party audience hours away at an event in Myrtle Beach on the hottest day of the Trump feud yet, \u201cyou can know to an absolute fact that they wouldn\u2019t do so as president either.\u201d READ: Mark Levin to Trump over Cruz feud: \u2018Cut the crap\u2019 As soon as he walked off the tense debate stage in Charleston on Thursday, Cruz suddenly shed any coyness about biting into Trump\u2019s persona. Yes, he \u201clikes\u201d Trump, but he is also an \u201cincredible marketer\u201d and a \u201ctalented entertainer.\u201d Yes, Trump\u2019s frustration is well-placed, but he is also \u201cspringing out of bed to tweet in a frantic response to the latest polls,\u201d as he told reporters with a smile Saturday in Fort Mill. And his aides, once loathe to even utter anything that could be construed as negative about the GOP front-runner, gleefully shared their favorite parts of Trump\u2019s history of political donations, an effort to tie him to New York\u2019s foremost liberal Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. Cruz himself looked to isolate Trump and his \u201cNew York values\u201d \u2013 in support of partial-birth abortion, gay marriage and gun control \u2013 from a culturally conservative South Carolina GOP electorate. (\u201cI\u2019m curious: Do the people of South Carolina know what New York values are?\u201d he asked with a deep laugh here Friday.) And even when Trump tried to regain control by making hay of an admitted mistake Cruz made when he didn\u2019t disclose certain campaign loans, Cruz\u2019s team breathed a sigh of relief as Trump was loudly booed by a Myrtle Beach crowd \u2013 after which he quickly exited the stage. But as much as Cruz\u2019s supporters may think they are the team to dethrone Trump from the king\u2019s perch here, most recent polls show Trump up by as many as 20 points. Even if Iowa and New Hampshire result in a split decision, Trump supporters say, there\u2019s a confidence South Carolina will be where the line is held \u2013 though his team on the ground is holding cards close to its chest. \u201cWe are actually occupied with work here,\u201d said Ed McMullen, Trump\u2019s co-chairman in the state, \u201cunlike some other campaigns.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019ll win it, and win by big numbers,\u201d said Jim Yates, holding a Trump-emblazoned sombrero and attending his sixth Trump event in the state. \u201cTrump is number one, and Cruz is second, in South Carolina values.\u201d Cruz and his allies are determined to deny Trump the victory that could thwart the momentum he\u2019s hoping for ahead of Super Tuesday, a date Cruz has described as his campaign\u2019s \u201cfirewall.\u201d Mike Gonzalez, who runs an influential network of pastors across the state and is helping Cruz, says he\u2019s eyeing a scenario in which Trump fails to blow away the field in the first two states and evangelicals in South Carolina make the state a death knell, even if not his Waterloo. READ: Cruz to tea party supporters: Don\u2019t get \u2018burned\u2019 by fake conservatives And Cruz\u2019s high-powered super PAC network is aiding his ground game more in South Carolina than any other state, as 14 field staffers operate side by side with those on the campaign payroll. Dan Tripp, who running the group\u2019s efforts here, pushed back on labeling what his troops are preparing for versus Trump as a \u201cbattle royale,\u201d but he knew the state for Cruz wasn\u2019t won they could risk losing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to set the tone for the beginning of the end,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader \u2013 and he\u2019d like to keep it that way. Heading into the final year of his first session leading the chamber \u2013 which begins Monday when the Senate returns from its winter recess \u2013 the Kentucky Republican is developing a carefully tailored legislative agenda. It is designed to support his top priority, which is not losing power to Democrats, who controlled the Senate for most of the past decade and who are committed to reclaiming it in the November elections. To complicate his effort, the soft-spoken and methodical McConnell must accomplish this against the backdrop of a wildly unpredictable 2016 GOP presidential nominating campaign that has two anti-Washington agitators \u2013 businessman Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas \u2013 leading the pack. The controversial tone of their campaigns has mainstream Republicans deeply concerned about the impact on down-ticket candidates \u2013 such as moderate GOP senators from purple states who must be re-elected if Republicans are to hold the Senate \u2013 especially if Trump or Cruz win the Republican nomination. Read: Takeaways from Ted Cruz\u2019s Iowa road trip Republicans currently have a narrow 54-46 advantage and must defend 24 seats this fall, seven in swing states that voted for President Barack Obama. Democrats need to protect just 10 seats, only one of which is considered competitive. A constant and challenging task in the months ahead for McConnell will be to protect incumbent senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Rob Portman of Ohio, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin from politically difficult votes on free trade, guns, abortion, and other sensitive social issues that could cause them trouble back home. McConnell, who is firmly rooted in the establishment wing of the GOP, spent his first year running the chamber with a strategic eye toward the 2016 Senate elections.  He believes he made an important down payment to voters by proving Republicans can govern more effectively and successfully than Democrats. \u201cBy any objective standard, I think the Senate is clearly back to work,\u201d McConnell said at a year-end news conference. He pushed through a number of major bills \u2013 such as highway funding and education reform \u2013 that were signed into law by Obama and he diligently prevented any real threat of government shutdowns or other dramatic \u201cfiscal cliffs\u201d that have shaken voters\u2019 nerves in recent years. \u201cI wanted to end those sort of rattling experiences that the American people don\u2019t like. It never produces a positive result anyway,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI took those off the table the day after the election and we began to figure out how to get the Senate working again.\u201d McConnell is tight-lipped about exactly which bills he will put on the floor and when ahead of the November election. Aides say many of those decisions need to be made after a joint House and Senate Republican retreat in Baltimore later this week. But he\u2019s made clear that restoring a regular appropriations process \u2013 where all 12 government spending bills will be debated and voted on separately \u2013 is key. Democrats fought that approach last year because Republicans were demanding higher spending for defense needs than domestic programs, a standoff that led to a breakthrough budget deal that set top-line government spending figures for 2016 and 2017. Because of that, Democratic leaders believe McConnell\u2019s ambition to take up all the spending bills may be doable. \u201cThat seems to be pretty fertile ground for bipartisan compromise,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York). It may be ambitious to believe all these bills can actually pass the partisan Congress, especially with a legislative calendar truncated by the political conventions and other campaign activities. But if the parties could agree on some individual spending bills it would lower the risk of major government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins October 1. That would be a relief to GOP leaders and a sign to voters they kept their word to avoid calamity. While there is a laundry list of other bills the Senate could take up this year \u2013 including a massive international trade deal and sweeping criminal justice reform \u2013 McConnell might be reluctant to negotiate anything major with a lame duck Democratic president and hold out to see if a Republican can win back the White House. Read: Where Obama is going after his final State of the Union address \u201cI think no matter which party controls the White House, during a presidential year everything is overtaken by that election,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a former top official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which works to elect GOP Senate candidates. \u201cI think both parties are in a wait-and-see mode in terms of who is going to control the White House in the following year. I think it\u2019s only prudent to hold off on big issues like this and see where things are in 12 months.\u201d McConnell\u2019s aim for a more modest legislative agenda differs dramatically with the priorities of the new House Speaker Paul Ryan who has said he wants his chamber to be an \u201cideas factory.\u201d Ryan also must placate a restive right flank that wants to push high-profile legislation that will draw sharp campaign year contrasts with Obama and congressional Democrats. Some of those hot-button issues \u2013 dealing with abortion, guns, climate change and more \u2013 will be politically complicated for McConnell if they are sent over from the House just as he is trying to protect swing state senators from tough votes. Other issues will compete for McConnell\u2019s attention. Many Republicans want to pass an Authorization for the Use of Military Force against ISIS, something that has regularly stalled in the past over policy differences. Ryan has approved a fresh look at an AUMF and if the House approves one if could put pressure on McConnell to act. The House is also readying to act on new sanctions against North Korea. On the domestic front, a battle is expected on a bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration over a push by some Republicans to privatize air traffic controllers. Democrats will demand votes on their agenda too. Helping Puerto Rico solve its debt crisis is a top priority for Democrats as is passing more gun control laws.  Republicans leaders have signaled they are open to possible legislation for the troubled U.S. territory but are flatly opposed to any new gun law, despite Obama\u2019s recent push on the issue. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do more on guns,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be silent on that.\u201d McConnell has already signaled he doesn\u2019t want to take up the Trans-Pacific Partnership measure \u2014 a legacy item for Obama \u2014 until after the election. Putting off votes on the controversial multi-nation free trade pact could benefit GOP senators up for re-election in rust belt states like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio where the loss of jobs to free trade deals is a sensitive subject. McConnell also has said he doesn\u2019t intend to draft a major overhaul of the tax code this year, even though it\u2019s a top goal of Ryan\u2019s. Because government funding levels were set in last year\u2019s budget deal, McConnell could skip doing a budget resolution this year, several congressional aides told CNN. Dropping the time-consuming budget process could give GOP Senate candidates more time at home campaigning. It would also allow them to avoid the ritual \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d when senators can offer up an infinite number of amendments, many of which are aimed at putting political squeezes on those running for re-election. A spokesman for McConnell denied that was true. \u201cWe\u2019re planning on a budget,\u201d Don Stewart said. Walsh, who as an official at the NRSC helped Republicans win back the Senate two years ago after eight years of Democratic majorities, said the key for McConnell and his conference is \u201cdemonstrating that they are doing the business of the American people in terms of funding the government, passing bills on time.  And that will benefit their candidates.\u201d \u201cI think the big issue is do no harm,\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh and Manu Raju contributed to this report",

Before a fired-up crowd of primarily pink-clad women, Clinton alluded to the controversies the group has faced since a series of videos by anti-abortion activists were released in 2015. Clinton argued that Republicans would \u201caccelerate the assault on access to safe and legal abortion\u201d and that she is the person best positioned to beat them in November. \u201cI will always defend Planned Parenthood and I will say consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported and protected, not undermined, misrepresented and demonized,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAs your president, I will always have your back.\u201d Clinton has grown fond of the electability argument in recent weeks because it allows her to both directly hit Republicans \u2013 as she did on Sunday \u2013 and subtly knock Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her chief rival for the Democratic nomination. \u201cWe need a Democratic nominee who will be able to beat the Republicans and get the job done for Americans,\u201d Clinton said before asking the audience that \u201cthe next president would easily appoint more than one justice to the Supreme Court.\u201d Read: How the Supreme Court could affect the 2016 election \u201cThat fight is not over either. Access to affordable birth control is still hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIf a Republicans wins this election and gets the chance to stack the Supreme Court with right wing justices, together they will accelerate the move to take America in the wrong direction on so many issues that you and I have fought for and many Americans take for granted.\u201d Clinton was introduced by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who said Clinton was the \u201cleader I trust in the White House to make sure women and families move forward.\u201d \u201cIn this election, with the attacks on women\u2019s health and rights, more than ever before we don\u2019t need a friend, a solid vote, a statement, we need a fighter,\u201d Richards said about the former secretary of state. In interview before the event, Richards said that while Sanders has long been a \u201cvery solid vote\u201d for their organization, she \u201ccould never remember a time where there is a stronger candidate for president [than Hillary Clinton] on the issues that are fundamental to Planned Parenthood.\u201d Sunday\u2019s endorsement was the first time the group is endorsing in a presidential primary. Planned Parenthood plans to spend at least $20 million in this election cycle and Richards said that will include many \u201cgrassroots efforts\u201d for Clinton.",

This will be the first time the group, which has been mired in controversy since a series of videos by anti-abortion activists were released in 2015, will endorse in a presidential primary. \u201cAs a lifelong Planned Parenthood supporter, I\u2019m honored to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund,\u201d Clinton said in response to the endorsement. \u201cThere has never been a more important election when it comes to women\u2019s health and reproductive rights \u2013 and Planned Parenthood\u2019s patients, providers, and advocates across the country are a crucial line of defense against the dangerous agenda being advanced by every Republican candidate for president.\u201d The group will make the endorsement official at what they are billing as their election kickoff event in Manchester, New Hampshire on Sunday. The group plans to spend at least $20 million in this election cycle, according to a press release. The endorsement was somewhat of a forgone conclusion. Clinton regularly mentions Planned Parenthood on the campaign trail \u2013 \u201cI will defend a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d she says \u2013 a line that draws applause from Democratic crowds. \u201cIn Congress and on the campaign trail, Republicans that claim they just hate big government are only too happy to have government step in when it comes to women\u2019s bodies and heath,\u201d Clinton said at the New Hampshire Democratic Party\u2019s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in 2015. \u201cIt is wrong, and we are not going to stand for it.\u201d Planned Parenthood\u2019s endorsement, which was first reported by CBS, is sure to draw scorn from Republican presidential candidates, many of whom regularly pledge to defund the group is elected president. In accepting the endorsement, Clinton said the United States needs \u201ca president who has what it takes to stop Republicans from defunding Planned Parenthood and taking away a woman\u2019s right to basic health care.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m elected,\u201d she added, \u201cI will be that president.\u201d This is the second national women\u2019s health group to back Clinton. NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC endorsed Clinton earlier this week, their president stating that Clinton \u201chas what it takes to fight Republican attacks on women\u2019s reproductive rights, and has the vision and experience to ensure women and families thrive.\u201d A Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado was the site of a shooting that killed three people in 2015. The shooter \u2013 Robert Lewis Dear \u2013 said in court that he was \u201ca warrior for the babies\u201d and that he was \u201cguilty.\u201d Clinton condemned the attack. \u201cToday and every day, we #StandWithPP,\u201d she tweeted on the day of the shooting. She later said the country should be \u201csupporting Planned Parenthood, not attacking it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The House voted to repeal Obamacare and cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood President Obama is expected to veto the bill The GOP-controlled House of Representatives on Wednesday afternoon passed legislation that would repeal Obamacare, and after more than 60 votes to roll back all or part of the law, the bill dismantle it will finally get to the President\u2019s desk. But it won\u2019t stay there long; President Barack Obama has vowed to veto any Republican bill that guts his signature health care law, a five-year-and-counting effort. The vote was 240-181, largely along party lines. The Senate passed the legislation last month, using a budget mechanism known as \u201creconciliation\u201d to overcome a Democratic filibuster. House Speaker Paul Ryan has told members he will hold an \u201cenrollment ceremony\u201d Thursday to sign the bill before sending it off to the White House. The measure would also bar any federal money for Planned Parenthood, something conservatives in Congress vowed to do after a series of videos released by an anti-abortion group last year triggered a controversy about the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood maintains the footage was edited and denied any improper activity. READ: Paul Ryan\u2019s 2016 plans start with Obamacare repeal vote Ryan conceded that the bill wouldn\u2019t move beyond Congress, but argued the vote was part of an effort this year to show a contrast with Democrats. \u201cThe people deserve a truly patient-centered health care system, and ultimately \u2013 ultimately, this is going to require a Republican president. That\u2019s why our top priority in 2016 is going to be offering the country a clear choice with a bold pro-growth agenda,\u201d Ryan said at a press conference before Wednesday\u2019s vote. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell released a statement after the House approved the measure, touting the \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d for coverage under the open enrollment process underway now for 2016. \u201cAs I travel the country, I consistently hear Americans say that they want Washington to build on the progress we have made to increase access to coverage, drive down the growth of health costs and improve the quality of care. Unfortunately, today\u2019s partisan effort in the House of Representatives to repeal key parts of the ACA, along with its effective defunding of Planned Parenthood, does the opposite,\u201d Burwell said. But House Republicans said voters in their districts complain about the cost of the law. \u201cOver and over again, people at home tell us that their insurance has become too expensive to use.  Premiums escalated by double digits in a single year, copayments and deductibles have likewise risen. People are learning that simply having an Obamacare insurance card is not the same as actual access to affordable healthcare,\u201d Rep Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said. One Democrat taunted the GOP for again voting on a measure to roll back the law, but still not having a plan to replace it, reminding them they promised  to do so five years ago. \u201cYou came up with nothing \u2013 nothing!  Rep Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, said to House Republicans on the House floor, asking them, \u201cIs it hidden in some secret room in the Capitol? Maybe Donald Trump has it. Perhaps we should alert the Capitol Police or better yet, maybe we should call the FBI to help locate the Republican plan on healthcare.\u201d Ryan told reporters that the GOP would talk about the details of an alternative health care bill at their retreat in Baltimore next week to plan the rest of the 2016 legislative agenda. Rep Ben Ray Lujan, the Chair of the House Democrats\u2019 campaign committee, argued the vote would hurt the GOP with key groups in the election this fall. \u201cIt\u2019s 2016 and House Republicans are still tightly bound to their old, failed playbook, which not only puts the health of millions of Americans at risk, but also threatens Republicans\u2019 standing with women, Latinos and other important groups of voters this election year.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Stemberger is an attorney and conservative leader based out of Orlando, Florida. He is a former political director of the Republican Party of Florida. For the past 10 years, Stemberger has served as president and general counsel of Florida Family Action. The views expressed in this column belong to Stemberger. This column contains language that might be offensive to some readers. We are experiencing something extraordinary in American politics: A man who has never held public office appears to have become a force of nature this election cycle, and he is achieving this, according to polls, with no small amount of support from evangelical Christians. The really puzzling thing is that Donald Trump defies every stereotype of a candidate you would typically expect Christians to vote for. How much does the average evangelical Christian supporting Trump know about his history?  Very little, it would seem. Many are content to follow the no-nonsense persona, rather than dig into Trump\u2019s past record. Trump professes to be a Christian and says the Bible is his favorite book.  While we should not judge a man\u2019s heart or motive, we can and should evaluate his words and actions. Therefore, there are three questions I believe all evangelical Christians should ask themselves before supporting Donald Trump for President. 1) What is known about Trump\u2019s personal life and morality? If elected, Trump would be the first president to: 2) Where does Trump stand on moral and social policy issues of concern to Christians and to which the Bible speaks to clearly? On many issues, Trump is saying the right things in terms of public policy. He presents himself broadly as a conservative on abortion, same-sex marriage, radical Islam and other social issues.  But one of the best indicators of a politician\u2019s future behavior is his record on issues. On abortion, in 1999, during a national television interview, Trump stated:  \u201cWell, I\u2019m very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debate the subject. But, you still, I just believe in choice.\u201d Again in 1999, Trump stated to the Associated Press, \u201cI believe it is a personal decision that should be left to the women and their doctors.\u201d In his book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d Trump stated, \u201cI support a woman\u2019s right to choose, but I am uncomfortable with the procedures.\u201d In 2011, Trump said he changed his mind on the issue of abortion but still supports abortion in the case of rape, incest and life of the mother. He also said he supports \u201cthe good aspects\u201d of funding Planned Parenthood. Trump also favors gay rights and same-sex marriage laws \u201cthat guaranteed same-sex couples equal legal rights as married, heterosexual couples.\u201d Trump also opposed the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy, the military\u2019s prior ban on openly gay service members. Gregory T. Angelo, president of the Log Cabin Republicans, an advocacy group for gay Republicans, has said of Trump, \u201cHe is one of the best, if not the best, pro-gay Republican candidates to ever run for the presidency,\u201d and that Trump would do no harm on same-sex marriage, and has a \u201cstand-out position\u201d on nondiscrimination legislation. How do we square his liberal record on social issues with his \u201csounding conservative?\u201d  How can we trust that what he is saying today is what he will actually do tomorrow? 3)  Are the love of money and pride legitimate issues to weigh when considering support for a presidential candidate? First, the Bible is very clear that \u201cthe love of money\u201d \u2013 not money itself \u2013 is \u201cthe root of all evil.\u201d  But Donald Trump is also very clear \u2013 he really loves money.  In fact, he has reminded us over and over again, relishing and boasting in how \u201creally rich\u201d he is.  Trump\u2019s TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d even used the O\u2019Jays\u2019 song \u201cFor the Love of Money\u201d as the theme song. It\u2019s not often that the Bible speaks with such clarity on what is evil.  How heavily should a Christian voter considering supporting Trump take into account his love of money? Secondly, Scripture declares \u201cGod opposes the proud and gives grace to the humble.\u201d  Proverbs says that \u201ceveryone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord.\u201d Trump is not just proud.  He is proud of being proud.  But don\u2019t take my word for it.  Just listen to most any speech he gives.  Trump has said, \u201cpart of the beauty of me is that I\u2019m very rich.\u201d All of us are sinners in need of grace. But what are we to do with a professing Christian who is openly proud and brags about his sin and who wants other Christians to trust and support him to be our next president? I do not believe every Christian has a moral duty to only vote for Christians.  In the Bible, God used even evil leaders for his purposes.  But when a choice is given, should evangelical Christians choose to elect a man I believe would be the most immoral and ungodly person ever to be president of the United States? There are times I read a verse from scripture and wonder whether God looked into the portals of time and breathed out very specific words for a certain time in history.  I believe II Timothy 3 is such a verse for today: \u201cBut understand this, that in the last days terrible times will come.  For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,  heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House to vote on Obamacare; President Obama has pledged to veto bill Speaker Paul Ryan wants to use the House to draw contrasts with Democrats House Speaker Paul Ryan kicks off the new year with an old Republican priority: repealing Obamacare. With the presidential campaign kicking into high gear, Ryan has said his 2016 plan is largely about drawing a contrast with Democrats and delivering a blueprint for the eventual Republican nominee to pick up and use as a platform once the party coalesces around a candidate later this year. It starts with the vote Wednesday giving the Republicans a chance to do something they\u2019ve been attempting for five years: getting a bill that rolls back key parts of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law to his desk. New year, old look: Paul Ryan shaves beard Obama has already pledged to veto the bill, and the GOP doesn\u2019t have the votes to override a veto. But the vote is a two-fer for the Republican base \u2013 the bill also would strip taxpayer money for Planned Parenthood, something the GOP was unable to get through as part of the spending bill approved shortly before the holidays. Many Republicans who oppose abortion rights denounced Planned Parenthood after a series of videos were released from an anti-abortion advocacy group last year that it says shows officials discussed selling fetal tissue. The group denied any improper activity and Democrats strongly opposed efforts to block federal funds. Ryan outlined an agenda centered around the theme for a \u201cconfident America\u201d in a speech last month at the Library of Congress, citing tax reform, trade legislation and proposals aimed at reducing poverty as items he wanted to tackle. The speaker pledged House Republicans will unveil an alternative to replace Obamacare, something GOP leaders have promised to do since the health care law was enacted in 2010. At the same time, he hasn\u2019t committed to having votes on any of these proposals, saying he doesn\u2019t want to prejudge a \u201cbottom up process\u201d that would give committee chairmen the power to craft legislative proposals and put their own stamp on them. Ryan insists he won\u2019t lay out a detailed legislative plan until he gets input from rank-and-file at a party retreat next week in Baltimore that will  include sessions with Senate Republicans. But conservatives are eager to go on the record, and have been disappointed that their leaders haven\u2019t allowed them to show they are keeping the promises they made when they took control of the House in 2010, and won back the Senate in 2014. \u201cThere should definitely be votes \u2013 we have to show that we genuinely want to do things differently and here\u2019s how,\u201d Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, an influential group of conservatives, told CNN. Democrats say Wednesday\u2019s vote isn\u2019t a sign of change. It will be the 62nd time Congress has moved to repeal all or parts of Obamacare, and they \u200esay that starting off the session with a partisan proposal is evidence that Ryan isn\u2019t serious about legislating. \u201cThis may be consistent with Mr. Ryan\u2019s, Speaker Ryan\u2019s agenda of essentially doing messaging in 2016 in preparation for the presidential election,\u201d the No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer, told reporters on Tuesday. He argued the GOP was reacting to the three candidates representing the party\u2019s base wanting an outsider to lead the country \u2013 businessman Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who Hoyer dubbed the \u201calliance of the angry.\u201d The bill is expected to pass the House mostly along party lines. It uses a budget tool known as \u201creconciliation,\u201d which allows the Senate to pass legislation with a simple majority, avoiding a filibuster from Democrats to block the bill that includes two items they repeatedly rejected. The GOP-controlled Senate passed it before the holidays. At Wednesday morning\u2019s closed-door House GOP conference meeting, Ryan told members he will hold an \u201cenrollment ceremony\u201d Thursday to sign the bill before sending it off to the White House. He invited all House Republicans to attend, a source in the meeting said. Ryan and top GOP leaders huddled in Annapolis, Maryland, early this week to begin charting plans for the compressed legislative year (the House is only in session 111 days in 2016). Next week, after the President\u2019s State of the Union address, which they will largely ignore, House and Senate Republicans head to Baltimore to finalize their next moves. Ryan wants the House to be an \u201cideas factory\u201d a senior GOP leadership aide tells CNN. He cites the model used in 1980 when then-Rep. Jack Kemp, a mentor of his, crafted a tax-reform proposal that President Ronald Reagan used when he was elected to shape a major overhaul of the complicated code. The speaker repeatedly insists he won\u2019t engage in the day-to-day debate on the 2016 presidential campaign contest but he is co-hosting a forum on poverty with presidential candidates on Saturday in South Carolina.  Although several candidates have committed to appearing\u2013 including GOP Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush \u2013 the top two Republican candidates leading in the polls, Trump and Cruz, are not slated to attend. Jordan also cited the Kemp model to CNN and agreed with Ryan the role of the House was to demonstrate that Republicans were doing what voters sent them to Washington to do \u2013 cut spending, reduce big government and reform entitlement programs. He told CNN that the GOP should consider using the same budget device it is using on Obamacare to get a proposal to overhaul federal welfare programs to the President\u2019s desk in 2016. Moderate House Republicans also want to see the House take votes on tough issues. Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell, who represents a competitive district that is home to many military forces in the Norfolk area, is pressing for Congress to vote on war authorization, or a new \u201cAuthorization for Use of Military Force\u201d to address the continuing war against the terror group ISIS. He said his constituents \u201cwant us to dial down the harshness and the deep persistent questioning of motives\u201d in Washington and try to find common ground on issues. Jordan, who serves on the House Oversight Committee, also cites Congress\u2019 function of holding government officials accountable as a key focus for 2016. He called for Ryan to move ahead with impeachment proceedings against Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen. He has come under fire for his handling of a scandal in which the agency admitted it targeted conservative groups during the last presidential campaign. The Freedom Caucus chairman, who backed Ryan to take John Boehner\u2019s place last fall after the speaker abruptly resigned, said he heard complaints from many voters in his district over the holidays about the year-end bipartisan spending bill that Ryan negotiated and he opposed. \u201cPeople hate the big spending omnibus that didn\u2019t address real conservative concerns,\u201d Jordan said. But he also said many told him they believe Ryan is an effective spokesman at the national level to chart where the party plans to go in 2016. Ryan is planning a flurry of media appearances around this week\u2019s vote repealing Obamacare, and also around next week\u2019s State of the Union address. He forcefully came out against the President\u2019s executive actions on gun control on Tuesday, which GOP members vow they will attempt to overturn. One promise Ryan made when he decided to run for speaker was to ensure spending bills funding federal agencies will go through \u201cregular order.\u201d This means members will get to offer a wide range of amendments, and engage in hours of freewheeling debate on the House floor. Moving these one-by-one avoids another massive year-end bill that critics say many members don\u2019t get time to review. They want a transparent process showing how Congress is addressing defense, homeland security, environmental issues and other issues. Members across the political spectrum cite the speaker\u2019s refrain about regular order as something they believe can transform the way the House does business. But the calendar poses a serious challenge for Ryan. There are a dozen spending bills he wants to get votes on the House floor and the early Republican National Convention slated to crown a nominee in July means the bulk of the action on those will have to get done before the extended summer break. While Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid agreed he wouldn\u2019t block consideration of these bills, Democrats still have the votes in the Senate to reject them from passing.  Another fall clash over spending, just weeks before the election, could test Ryan\u2019s ability to hold his party together and avoid a possible shutdown. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone that\u2019s got the skills, the smarts and the likability factor to navigate through this it\u2019s Paul Ryan,\u201d Rigell told CNN.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Jill Filipovic: Michelle Obama spoke for many when she told Oprah Winfrey: \"We are feeling what not having hope feels like\" Filipovic: A post-White House Michelle Obama will be able speak her mind and pursue and advocate for things she believes in Michelle Obama said something stunning this week: Discussing the election of Donald Trump, she told Oprah Winfrey, in a clip that aired Friday on CBS, \u201cWe are feeling what not having hope feels like.\u201d Welcome to the club. For many women across the United States, Mrs. Obama occupies a similar role to that of Ms. Winfrey: a widely admired, deeply trusted and well-liked figure who has broken barriers without breaking down the ways so many of us relate to her. Obama is careful and polished, but her public persona is less meticulously measured than that of her husband, the President. She is the rare American figure who is both aspirational and relatable. So when she asks, \u201cWhat else do you have if you don\u2019t have hope?\u201d in a moment when so many Americans have expressed hopelessness at the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency \u2013 worried sick about a President-elect who ran a campaign infused with  embitterment, misogyny, and racism, who seems happy to disregard some of our nation\u2019s oldest democratic norms and who may have been helped along by Russian interference \u2013 she\u2019s telling us that she\u2019s walking this scary path right along with us. Perversely, hearing Mrs. Obama talk has made me the most hopeful I\u2019ve felt since Election Day. Here\u2019s why: As First Lady, she had to play according to conservative, conformist rules, and as the country\u2019s first African-American First Lady, she had to take extra care to maintain an image of sophistication and excellence. Once her husband is out of the White House, she\u2019ll be significantly freer \u2013 to speak her mind, pursue her own passions and advocate for the things she believes in. MIchelle Obama's 'Let's Move!' program Michelle Obama has been clear she doesn\u2019t have electoral ambitions, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019s going to retreat from the worlds of politics and advocacy. She is, after all, a brilliant and ambitious woman with years of notable work under her belt, from her years in private legal practice, to her work in the public sector, to running a nonprofit, to working in academia. Her biography has naturally been overshadowed by the President\u2019s, but Michelle Obama\u2019s life has been one of hard work and substantial accomplishment, much of it in the service of making the world \u2014 certainly her community \u2013 a better place. What she\u2019ll do next is still a question mark. Perhaps it\u2019ll be something in the health universe, along the lines of her \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d program promoting child and adolescent health. And maybe now she\u2019ll have the ability to go bolder \u2013 her ambitions to change the American food system were thwarted by corporate food interests that have immense influence in Congress. Even what she could say in public seemed inhibited by her husband\u2019s position. When she\u2019s no longer the First Lady, perhaps we\u2019ll see her taking a louder and more forceful stand. Michelle Obama on election: 'We are Americans first' Or maybe we\u2019ll see her embrace the important issues long neglected by prominent politicians. I would personally love to see her promote abortion rights, which have been deemed too controversial for full-throated advocacy from many middle-of-the road Democrats, or maternal health \u2013 African American women, after all, continue to die during pregnancy or childbirth in astounding and shameful numbers, and their plight has been largely ignored by the political establishment. Perhaps like Michelle Obama, I\u2019ve spent the past month in what feels like a bottomless well of hopelessness. I know I\u2019m not alone \u2013 and that she just threw out a lifeline.",

Levy is executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University and a former columnist and editorial writer at Newsday who has covered seven presidential elections. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Once again, suburban voters play a critical role in selecting the winner of the US presidential election Lawrence C. Levy: Trump must listen to and address the concerns of his suburban electorate, or he will pay a price Once again, as they have almost every four years since they became the dominant voting bloc, the \u201cswinging\u201d suburbs picked the winner of a US presidential election. But if suburbanites hold the keys to the White House, as well as control of Congress, these independent-minded voters also offer a doorway to winning after the election. If the President-elect and leaders of both major parties want to build coalitions for legislation, they will look to the centrist sensibilities of suburbanites for policy compromises that might isolate partisans on the far right and left. Neither predictably \u201cblue\u201d like Democratic city voters nor reliably \u201cred\u201d as their rural counterparts, suburbanites have migrated to the \u201cpurple\u201d middle of American politics. And the winning national candidates are usually the ones who build a bridge to the \u2018burbs from their city or country bases. This year, enough suburbanites leaned right toward their rural counterparts \u2013 especially in a handful of the most competitive swing states \u2013 to give the Republicans the presidency and continued control of Congress. That wasn\u2019t widely expected. Many suburbs are becoming more diverse demographically and politically, with a surge of new immigrants and other minorities turning these places from red to purple, if not blue \u2013 and doing so in local and state elections, as well as national. These places should not have been hospitable to Trump. And during the primaries, they weren\u2019t: Trump did relatively poorly in suburbs against his Republican opponents, even in states he won. The 'Springsteen paradox' that explains why Trump won Michigan As expected, Clinton crushed Trump in many so-called \u201cinner ring\u201d suburbs in most of the competitive states. The suburbs immediately outside Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, went strongly for Clinton. The suburbs outside Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, also supported Clinton, along with those outside Denver and Las Vegas. Even in two of the three arguably blue states that ultimately cost Clinton the election,  Pennsylvania and Michigan, she performed as well as Obama did in most of the suburbs that ringed major cities. In Oakland County, a prosperous, GOP-leaning suburb of Detroit, Clinton maintained an eight-point edge. The \u201cbig four\u201d suburban counties contiguous to deep blue Philadelphia provided Clinton with a collective margin of nearly 200,000 votes, more than enough to win that coveted state in a \u201cnormal\u201d year. But this wasn\u2019t a normal year. According to exit polls, Trump took the suburbs nationally by 5 points. Even if that number should shrink as Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote expands, the margin is likely to be more than any presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush. Critical Counties: How Trump seized the map and Clinton lost it Trump did it by playing tactical hopscotch. His campaign skipped many of the near-in suburbs that lean more Democratic and focused heavily on \u201couter-ring\u201d suburbs and rural-suburban places called \u201cexurbs.\u201d He went after both wealthier lifelong \u201cMcMansion Republicans\u201d and looked for the Trump version of \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d in relatively poorer enclaves \u2013 a number of whom had supported Obama and Bill Clinton. However hard she may, or may not, have tried, Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t pry away the GOP loyalists or retain the blue-collar Democrats. In Pennsylvania, where Clinton dominated Philadelphia and its inner suburbs, the story was different in the next rings out. Take Berks County, where Obama lost in 2012 by 1 point: Trump won by 10. In the exurb of Carbon County, where Obama lost by 6, Clinton was buried by 24. In Luzerne, which Obama carried by 5 points, Trump won by 20. If Clinton had managed to hold onto outer suburbs that Obama won or had done nearly as well in losing them, it\u2019s likely she would be president-elect, regardless of the surge of voters in small rural towns. Critical Counties \u2014 Jefferson, Colorado: The growing suburbs But now that the campaign and number-crunching is over, another arguably more important campaign has begun. And that is the one to move the country forward by governing. The lesson in these numbers is that if leaders don\u2019t heed suburbanites, they could pay a price politically and miss an opportunity for sound policy. Almost every one of the approximately 40 congressional seats identified by both parties as competitive this year were wholly or substantially suburban. They\u2019re filled with moderates who \u201cvote the person, not party\u201d \u2013 but who will and do punish those who let them down with partisan or ideological lurches from the mainstream. The whipping that the Democrats took in 2010, when they lost control of Congress, isn\u2019t the first time presidents and parties faced a quick backlash to voters\u2019 remorse. On the policy front, mobilizing these swing suburban voters and their representatives could pay dividends in generating bipartisan coalitions to pass major legislation on transportation, health care, environmental protection and other issues that less-centrist politicians wouldn\u2019t approve because they \u201cwent too far\u201d or \u201cnot far enough.\u201d The same could be true in blocking controversial efforts such as rolling back abortion rights or workplace protections.  If Trump wants to retain the affection of the suburbanites who backed him \u2013 and perhaps gain among those, particularly in swing states, who rejected him \u2013 he will pay attention to what\u2019s going on in these communities. Many suburbs are facing the same problems of the cities from which people once fled to outer counties: rising crime and drug addiction, more failing schools, crumbling infrastructure and inadequate health care for a growing portion of the population. Yet, unlike cities in particular, suburbs are often a mishmash of small governments that may have been charmingly quaint a generation ago but are spectacularly unprepared \u2013 fiscally, professionally and politically \u2013 to deal with these complex and expensive problems. In short, Trump and Congress need to disabuse themselves of the myths of suburban wealth and wellness that mistakenly make them a lesser priority for policymakers.",

He writes frequently for CNN Opinion. Follow him on Twitter @FordVox. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Ford Vox: Despite Trump's new compromise talk, his (and GOP's) campaign rhetoric bodes ill for Obamacare's survival Vox, a doctor, says he's deeply worried that Trump's allegiance to unfettered capitalism will end up blocking access to care Donald Trump might be suddenly making some noises in the direction of preserving parts of Obamacare, but let\u2019s be realistic. There\u2019s every reason to believe that what we know as the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s central achievement, won\u2019t survive Trump\u2019s presidency. While President-elect Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to have Congress repeal Obamacare on day one isn\u2019t technically feasible, it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll largely dismantle this capstone progressive program, thanks to the supportive Republican Congress he\u2019ll enjoy (at least until the midterm elections). While I fear greatly for my patients, this potential decision, while highly risky, could at least mean an end to the political gridlock surrounding health care that also represented a pressing threat to quality medicine. Let me illustrate this: As someone who practiced medicine both before and after the ACA, I\u2019ve witnessed its highs and its lows. I once treated a man who\u2019d suffered a large brain bleed in a fall down a staircase. He struggled in the hospital through numerous complications over the course of months, and with our help, his family was able to apply for and receive commercial insurance coverage in his home state while he was still in the hospital. This coverage, which they got over the Obamacare exchange, meant he was able to get the equipment and therapies he needed to successfully transition home with his family. This was miraculous because before Obamacare, he would have had to apply for Medicaid coverage, which would require becoming destitute if he was not already, and remaining poor if he hoped to keep coverage that he either could not get or could not afford on the private insurance market. Conversely, a colleague of mine recently treated an entrepreneur who covered herself through an exchange policy while building her business. She thought she bought a quality plan, but when she suffered a spinal cord injury in a car accident that caused significant paralysis and necessitated prolonged rehabilitation, she found that her ACA plan capped her rehabilitation coverage at an arbitrary 30 days. Now, limits on rehabilitation coverage aren\u2019t uncommon even in insurance plans outside the exchange, but they can sometimes be successfully appealed with proper documentation and when physicians lay out a good case to insurance medical directors. An appeal wasn\u2019t even possible with this low-quality insurance plan, which enforced an arbitrary, black and white, calendar-based cutoff, no matter how much clinical improvement was happening, or what the medical evidence supported. What will happen to Obamacare when Trump takes office? The presidential campaign concluded with a lot of focus on health care, with headlines about large, upcoming premium increases attracting enormous attention. President Obama and Hillary Clinton never successfully communicated to the nation that they understood the problems with the ACA and were trying to improve it, but were repeatedly thwarted by Republicans in Congress. Too many voters got the impression Democrats considered the ACA to be flawless. The final presidential debate also featured Trump\u2019s poor understanding of late-term abortion, reminding much of the electorate about the power the new president will have to select justices to the Supreme Court who will share his views. Whatever voters intended in selecting Donald Trump, no one casting a ballot for him should have been unaware that he represents a radical change from the path that President Obama selected in forging the ACA and that Hillary Clinton wanted to continue. After the election, one patient\u2019s mother expressed concerns to me about her son\u2019s ability to get health insurance in the future, if Obamacare were abolished, given that the injury that brought him into my care would be considered a pre-existing condition. This concern is adding stress to an already overwhelming situation, as she ponders whether an elective procedure should be done now or whether they should wait to see if the problem he\u2019s having now resolves on its own or becomes more problematic in the future, as we have advised. Sen. Franken: Obamacare premium hikes hurt Clinton Health care analysts have observed that unlike other elements of Obamacare that President Trump and his supportive Congress might easily drop through budget reconciliation (such as the exchanges), removing the ban on exclusions to pre-existing conditions requires passing legislation through the Senate. Democratic senators could filibuster such repeal legislation, and Republicans don\u2019t have the 60 votes necessary to break that filibuster, but Republicans intent on killing the ban could simply change the Senate rules to prevent a filibuster in the first place. They could also choose to attach repeal legislation to other essential legislation, forcing its passage. What\u2019s more, the Trump administration would likely drop the Obama administration\u2019s appeal of House v. Burwell, meaning the federal district court ruling that exchange insurance subsidies aren\u2019t constitutional will stand. But even without these possible maneuvers, if Trump kills the insurance exchanges, and along with them the subsidies necessary to make health care plans affordable, Obamacare is over. You cannot mandate that individuals purchase insurance they cannot afford, and you cannot force insurers to cover anyone who comes knocking if there isn\u2019t a mandate forcing plenty of healthy people to offset their costs by buying into the system. Health care giant pulls back from Obamacare exchanges As for a replacement for Obamacare, Trump was famously vague on the campaign trail about what he intends to do, other than declaring it will be awesome. There\u2019s a four-page policy brief on his campaign website, and the Trump administration\u2019s new transition website, GreatAgain.Gov, features a few bullet points. But if, as he has threatened, he\u2019s going to get rid of every last vestige of the ACA, he would be \u201cprotecting people\u2019s right\u201d to do something monumentally stupid: live life free of medical insurance coverage. As doctors like me know all too well, that plan works right up until the minute it doesn\u2019t. Trump\u2019s policy wonks talk a lot about the wonder of the free market, and how, unshackled from the concerns of a conscientious government, insurance companies will see it in their best interest to offer affordable care to everyone. Trump believes in trickle-down health care. He has alluded to allowing insurance companies to offer their plans across state lines, facilitating price comparisons among hospitals and doctors, letting you sock away money in health savings accounts that won\u2019t disappear, allowing you to share your HSA with your family and pass it on in your will, and letting you deduct the costs of health insurance from your taxes. The truth about those rising health insurance premiums These are great moves for people who are making good incomes and can engage in that free market. But it\u2019s very similar to what we had before. Though some consumers will have more money in their pockets to shop, and they might have a few more choices while shopping, Trump has been adamant that he won\u2019t force insurers to sell to everyone. And you would not be able to access this free market even if you\u2019re well off if you have a pre-existing condition. In the free market we had before Obamacare, insurers said \u201cno thanks\u201d to 1 in 5 potential customers because those customers had conditions insurers didn\u2019t want to cover. In a sign of how unpredictable this presidency is going to be, while none of Trump\u2019s policy statements discuss preserving the pre-existing condition protections of the ACA, or the ability of parents to keep their children on their plans until age 26, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that he\u2019s now supportive of keeping these provisions. President Obama managed to persuade Trump of their importance during their 90-minute meeting Thursday, a remarkable feat given that a year and a half of policy debates on the campaign trail did nothing.  In this,Trump is starting to sound a lot like the typical American voter, who supports individual provisions of the ACA but suddenly dislikes the law the minute it\u2019s revealed to be Obamacare. But how might a free marketeer like Trump force insurers to take on bad risks outside the ACA? For that, we can look back to his previous policy statements. Instead of being able to shop around on the open market with your pre-tax dollars and your HSA account, you\u2019ll probably be relegated to something called a high-risk pool.The high risk pools were very limited state-based markets that feature high premiums. High risk pools require tax dollars to work, just like Obamacare, and the Trump administration would have to expand them enormously to make up for the loss of exchange plans. They\u2019re quite simply a far more inefficient, inequitable and unaffordable way to do what the ACA has done. Democrats will still be a factor in the next wave of health care reform, but Trump has every tool he needs to remove everything President Obama did and issue radically different policies. The ACA and Medicare were headed down a path of transforming hospitals and clinicians into money managers and quasi insurance companies that would need to weigh one patient\u2019s needs versus another\u2019s, and that trend concerned me enormously. I don\u2019t think President Trump will continue that effort so vigorously, and that\u2019s something. But I\u2019m deeply worried that Trump\u2019s blind allegiance to unfettered capitalism won\u2019t mesh with quality medicine. The people he surrounds himself with will matter quite a lot, and so far he isn\u2019t distancing himself from the odd ducks who encircled him during his campaign. So I worry that somebody like Ben Carson as head of the Department of Health and Human Services would spend more effort on blocking access to care because of his extreme religious beliefs than finding efficiencies. And don\u2019t get me started on green-coffee-bean-extract-swiller Surgeon General Mehmet Oz. After what\u2019s coming, we may all need a detox cleanse.",

The views expressed in these commentaries are their own. I supported and celebrated Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate not only because she is a female human being, but because she stood for the right of all women in the world to decide our own reproductive lives; for a foreign policy that recognizes violence against females as the biggest indicator of all other violence; against global warming as an ultimate warning and danger, and for democracies that see people as linked, not ranked. It\u2019s important to remember that she won the popular majority vote with every one of those positions, and that Donald Trump opposes them all, would put women\u2019s reproductive lives in the hands of the government, and sees the world as a hierarchy with him at the top. What he seems not to know is that all change grows from the bottom, like a tree, and he might slow change but can never stop it.  Young women should go on doing what they know is right. I and countless others are here to help. Gloria Steinem is a feminist activist and author. Having a female candidate as the nominee of a major political party confirmed the art of dreaming.

The most important challenge in life is our ability to compassionately imagine the lives of others \u2013 all the ways their struggles and joys are different from our own.  And yet, Donald Trump\u2019s entire campaign has been based around the idea that white men want their country \u201cback.\u201d  His victory feels like a rejection of people like me (a transgender woman) \u2013 and  of every single last soul in this country who has a \u201cdifference.\u201d  After this election, how will we react to \u201cdifference?\u201d  With love and compassion? Or with hatred and fear? Jennifer Finney Boylan is the author of 15 books and is the inaugural Anna Quindlen Writer in Residence at Barnard College of Columbia University. She also serves as the national co-chair of the Board of Directors of GLAAD. This year\u2019s election had a lot of Billie Jean King vs. Bobby Riggs in it.  And not everyone had the stomach for it. The divisiveness in our nation around this election takes me back to the 1970s with Title IX, Vietnam, Watergate, the Women\u2019s Movement and Roe v. Wade.  Only this time around there was much less civility.   But as I have learned, making history is not an easy responsibility, it\u2019s a constant challenge and when you truly believe in the cause, you never walk away from the fight. Today\u2019s 14-year-old boys and girls will be eligible to vote in the next presidential election. When they go to the polls, they will have already seen an African American man lead our nation and a woman make a powerful bid for the job. This level of equality in action gives them a broader perspective and will empower them as they become our future leaders. Billie Jean King is a former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She is the founder of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative and a 2009 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I think most would agree that Hillary Clinton has already succeeded. Hillary has cracked the glass ceiling. She may not have broken it, but she has paved the way for the little girl who will one day soar through it. She taught us all that the \u201cImpossible is Nothing\u201d slogan, which most of us grew up believing was reserved for great men like my father, applies to boys and girls.  The moment Hillary Clinton announced her presidential candidacy she sent a subliminal shockwave to little girls of all ages around the world, just as my father once did when he empowered a room full of little brown boys by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve shown you now what WE can do \u2026I\u2019ve shown you all what YOU can accomplish!\u201d Hana Yasmeen Ali is the co-author with her father of \u201cThe Soul of a Butterfly.\u201d She is currently working on her memoir, \u201cAt Home with Muhammad Ali\u201d (Penguin Random House), due mid 2017. I salute you, Secretary Clinton, for becoming the first woman to be one of the major parties\u2019 nominee for President. You have broken a glass ceiling that desperately needed shattering and it is my hope that as a result many women will show the country what a difference a woman can make. Christie Todd Whitman served as the Republican governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001 and is an advisory committee member of the Women\u2019s Coalition for Common Sense, the bipartisan initiative founded by former US Rep.

Role models are hugely important, particularly in industries like tech were women are so vastly underrepresented. Fortunately, the history of computer science is full of female leaders \u2013 from Grace Hopper to Katherine Johnson, who wrote code for the first moon landing \u2013 and we need to promote the stories of these past leaders and elevate new female leaders in tech. Reshma Saujani is the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code. When I was a child, a woman could not keep her job if she was pregnant, could not report sexual harassment, could not get a credit card or mortgage, could not have a legal abortion, and could not run in the Boston Marathon. There were laws prohibiting interracial marriage, and segregation was still rampant in the South. And we fought for what is right. When I was a young adult, I watched friends suffer and die from a hideous disease that, at the time, was attributed exclusively to the gay community. And we fought for equality. As a young mother, I walked my child home from kindergarten as smoke billowed above in downtown Manhattan, while shock, fear and grief enveloped everyone around us. And we came together as a nation. As an adult orphan, I witnessed the first woman run for the most powerful office in the world with dignity and class as she fought the forces of bigotry, ageism, intolerance, rancor, untruths, and wanton sexism. And we learned the fight is not over. In the words of Dorothy Fields, a daughter of Polish immigrants who was 15 years old when women were granted the right to vote: Now nothing\u2019s impossible, I\u2019ve found for when my chin is on the ground, I pick myself up, dust myself off, and start all over again. Don\u2019t lose your confidence if you slip, be grateful for a pleasant trip, And pick yourself up, dust off, start over again.

Just as the election of the first black president showed us how racist our country still is, the candidacy of a woman revealed how sexist we still are. We will have to work hard to change the deep prejudices against women, but at least they will be out in the open for the first time. These events have made me so much more aware of all the work we have yet to do. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the unmistakable prejudice against women in America. So many other countries have had women leaders yet for us it seems so difficult. How is this connected with our love affair with weapons? With our history as a country that always wanted to expand westward? I thought we were making much more progress against prejudice but the witch hunt against Hillary Clinton seems to have worked. I\u2019ve always believed that the word can change the world. For the first time, I am wondering if this is true. It seems we will have a president incapable of reading. That can be truly dangerous. I hope I am wrong and that America\u2019s good heartedness will triumph. Erica Jong is a poet, novelist and nonfiction writer with more than 24 books published.

As a women\u2019s college with more than a century of success in creating women leaders, we understand this mission better than anyone. Although Secretary Clinton did not become president, we are living at a transformational moment for women and for women\u2019s leadership. No matter our political views, the achievements of Hillary Rodham Clinton have set a new standard, both symbolically and literally, for the heights to which women can rise. For the first time, women see themselves reflected at the highest level of leadership and feel a profound sense of hope for all that is possible. They are inspired to find their voice, to take risks, to match their competence with confidence in pursuing tangible, positive change in the world\u2014to make, as Hillary said to her fellow graduating classmates at Wellesley in 1969, \u201cwhat appears to be impossible, possible.\u201d History has taught us that real progress doesn\u2019t happen overnight. While the opportunity for women\u2019s leadership continues to expand, social and economic inequality continues to increase, and these inequities weigh especially heavily on women. Wellesley and other advocates for women\u2019s leadership have a responsibility to tackle these inequities head on \u2013 we must keep pushing to transform the world into which the next generation of women will lead. Paula A. Johnson is the 14th president of Wellesley College.

Despite the outcome, Hillary Clinton won the nomination and has had such an incredible fight to the finish. It speaks volumes about the power of women and our innate ability to nurture, to lead, to love, and to last. There is no loss as I watch Hillary Clinton\u2019s rise as she sought the nation\u2019s highest office. Whatever the outcome, it is a win for all women.

My heart aches with disappointment. Today, we have suffered a great wound. Not just as women but as Americans. However, the legacy of Hillary Clinton, along with her unparalleled accomplishment of being the first woman to receive her party\u2019s nomination for president of the United States, shall forever remain a powerful symbol of hope for women, young and old, everywhere. It is proof that the glass ceiling can hold us down only as long as we refuse to shatter it. And, in spite of her tragic defeat, now and future generations of women will remember this incredible woman\u2019s unwavering determination and the enormous strides she made towards finally shutting down gender inequality.

But my experience from the lowliest grassroots to the highest halls of power tells me that defeat brings new opportunities that will soon unfold, sometimes in ways we never imagined.  So grieve for a day or two, ladies, and let\u2019s get back to work. The movement for gender parity in leadership has just become more important than ever. Gloria Feldt is co-founder and president of Take the Lead.

I refuse to be robbed of this moment. It may not be the ultimate goal of feminist transformation, but it is history, and we\u2019re making it.

It has reminded me of both of the challenges and the triumphs women face in America. This campaign has been a reminder that women have to support each other in the face of sexism and prejudice and that when we share our strength with each other, anything is possible.

It\u2019s not thatwe missed history, the chance to lift high and celebrate our first woman president. It\u2019s that the clearly qualified, experienced, brilliant, dedicated lifelong public servant didn\u2019t get the chance to start her work on our behalf in the Oval Office. This election came to a tragic ending. The protests are already raging. And it\u2019s going to take a lot of smart people to work around what is in store for us in the shaping of the next Supreme Court, the Congress, the Senate.

As a foreign correspondent and photojournalist, I work in countries where women do not often have equal rights: a girl does not attend school, a woman can not choose her husband, she needs permission from her male relatives to work outside the home, receives death threats for running for public office, and has only recently obtained the right to vote. Having a woman president would only affirm my own belief that women are equally capable and qualified to participate in every realm of society, and to serve as president, the highest office of the United States of America.  The US is commonly viewed as a role model in the international community.  But, unlike Germany, Bangladesh, the UK, India, and Norway, among many others, we have never had a female leader.  It\u2019s time to join the ranks of other countries who have entrusted women to lead. Lynsey Addario is the author of the New York Times best-selling memoir, \u201cIt\u2019s What I Do: A Photographer\u2019s Life of Love and War,\u201d which is out in paperback from Penguin Books. Lynsey made a name for herself following the 9/11 attacks as a photographer of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. In a male dominated-field, Lynsey worked to carve out a spot of her own, and in doing so, she found an advantage in what many considered a disadvantage: Lynsey was granted access to photograph women and children when most of her male coworkers were not. Regardless of where you stand politically, and despite my misgivings regarding Hillary Clinton, having women running at this level is something to be proud of. For me personally, I\u2019ve had my eyes opened throughout this election. I\u2019m incredibly worried about women in America today when I see such a horrific individual as the soon-to-be leader of my country. We have a lot more work to do in this country than I previously thought, and I think conservative women like myself have been awakened to how important our involvement is.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Kate Andersen Brower is the author of the best-sellers \u201cFirst Women: The Grace and Power of America\u2019s Modern First Ladies\u201d and \u201cThe Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.\u201d Unless otherwise noted, facts in this piece reflect research from those works. The opinions expressed here are hers. Kate Andersen Brower: Every first lady found own way to navigate gender and power Even boldest of them would be surprised by Melania Trump, Brower says If America\u2019s most celebrated first ladies were alive today \u2013 Abigail Adams, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jacqueline Kennedy \u2013 I think they would be amazed at the prospect of a first Lady who was a former model and who had once posed nude, but I also think that Melania Trump would be far easier for them to understand than a first first gentleman such as Bill Clinton would have been. That is because these women, like Melania Trump, wielded their power discreetly and lived during a time when it would have been unthinkable for a former first lady to run for office (Hillary Clinton is the only one to do so), much less become president. Bess Truman said the first lady\u2019s job is to \u201csit beside her husband and be silent,\u201d something Melania Trump has a lot of experience doing. I think she will be more like Bess Truman and her successor Mamie Eisenhower, who proudly announced that she had \u201conly one career, and his name is Ike\u201d and not at all like the two \u201ctraditional\u201d first ladies she said she most admires: Jacqueline Kennedy \u2013 Melania Trump is 15 years older than she was when she became first lady \u2013 and Betty Ford \u2013 who was outspoken about her mastectomy and being for abortion rights. When Melania Trump says, \u201cMy hands are full with my two boys \u2013 my big boy and my little boy!\u201d and when she insists that she is neither \u201cneedy\u201d or \u201cnagging,\u201d it reminds me of Mamie Eisenhower, who said, \u201cBeing a wife is the best career life has to offer a woman.\u201d Melania Trump\u2019s transition to the position of first lady will take time \u2013 it does for everyone. Michelle Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, Jackie Norris, told me, \u201cI think there were a lot of people saying no to her in the beginning, \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t do this. No, I\u2019m sorry, you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 \u201d There were growing pains for Michelle Obama, and she went through more chiefs of staff than her predecessor, Laura Bush. The East Wing is sometimes referred to as \u201cGuam\u201d among West Wing staffers because it\u2019s so far outside of the circle of power and because top West Wing aides often exclude East Wing staffers from important meetings. Then-Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel did not include Jackie Norris at the all-important 7:30 a.m. West Wing planning meeting and thereby diminished her power. It is important that the first lady stand up for her staff, as Hillary Clinton did when she was first lady, or else they will be steamrolled and it remains to be seen whether Melania Trump will be able to do that. The secrets first ladies always keep In the 227-year history of the American presidency, there has only been one other first lady born outside the United States: Louisa Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams who was born in London. But unlike Melania Trump, Louisa Adams grew up surrounded by politics and diplomacy as the daughter of an American diplomat and an English mother. When she got to the White House, she knew the presidency well \u2013 her father-in-law, John Adams, was the nation\u2019s second president. Melania Trump, on the other hand, has no experience being married to an elected official, as all other modern first ladies have had, with the exception of Mamie Eisenhower. (President Dwight D. Eisenhower had been supreme commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World War II before he was elected president.)  Like Bess Truman, who left Washington every chance she could get, it seems Melania Trump was not all that excited about the prospect of her husband running for president. Before Donald Trump kicked off his campaign in June 2015, his wife pleaded with him, \u201cWe have such a great life. Why do you want to do this?\u201d He told her, \u201cI sort of have to do it, I think. \u2026 I could do such a great job.\u201d I do think Melania Trump will enjoy some ultra-feminine traditional aspects of the position, as Mamie Eisenhower did, including poring over state dinner menus and approving floral arrangements. Even if Melania Trump is influential on policy decisions or as an adviser to her husband, we are unlikely to hear about it. Political savvy is something first ladies such as Mamie Eisenhower and Bess Truman typically deployed only behind the scenes, except in rare instances. When Hillary Clinton was first lady, she hung a large photograph of herself speaking at a podium on a wall of her West Wing office. Underneath there was a message: \u201cYou are so good, Love, Bill.\u201d It was a display of admiration for her political acumen that I think is as unlikely in Melania Trump\u2019s office as it would have been in Mamie Eisenhower\u2019s.  Jackie Kennedy was just 31 when she became first lady, making her the third-youngest first lady in history (behind Frances Folsom Cleveland, who was 21, and Julia Gardiner Tyler, who was 24). Kennedy of course is best known for her chic fashion sense, something I\u2019m sure Melania Trump admires, but she was more plugged into her husband\u2019s administration than she\u2019s given credit for: She knew about his plan to get rid of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and she was a sounding board for him during the Cuban missile crisis. She was much more than a clotheshorse; in fact, she was shrewd and unforgiving: During her astonishingly candid conversation with her friend, the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jackie Kennedy called Indira Gandhi, the future prime minister of India, a \u201cprune\u201d and said she was \u201cbitter\u201d and a \u201ckind of pushy, horrible woman\u201d and she wondered aloud what was wrong with former ambassador Clare Boothe Luce and her \u201cqueer thing for power.\u201d Like all of the women who find themselves in the White House, Melania Trump will have to meet endless expectations in a role with no constitutional definition, no job description and no pay. While Abigail Adams pleaded with her husband to make laws that were \u201cmore generous and favorable\u201d to women, women did not get the right to vote until more than 100 years after her death. And so, I think, having a woman in the position, even a woman who once posed nude and who will be the first third wife of a president, would be easier for these former first ladies to comprehend than a man married to the president. Bill Clinton\u2019s return to the White House after all would not have just represented a political first; it would have been a seismic cultural shift when it comes to gender roles. It is not that I think former first ladies would have disapproved, it is that they would not have been able to comprehend it. Recently, while channel-surfing late one night, I stumbled upon the 1964 comedy \u201cKisses for My President\u201d in which a hapless Fred MacMurray struggles to cope with being married to the first female president, played by Polly Bergen. Things run amok until Bergen\u2019s character gets pregnant and decides to resign the presidency so that she can take care of their family. This ending, absurd to 21st-century audiences, would have made sense to Jackie Kennedy and Eleanor Roosevelt because to them, the concept of a female president was absurd in and of itself. The idea of a first gentleman would have been preposterous.  Jackie Norris fondly remembers the time when, after the election, Michelle Obama\u2019s staff was warmly greeted by Laura Bush\u2019s aides and shown a blueprint of what mistakes they had made and that they hoped the incoming first lady would avoid and which events were crucial and which they could safely skip. \u201cWhat they wanted,\u201d Norris recalled fondly, \u201cwas to completely set aside politics and to help us succeed and to help Michelle Obama succeed as first lady.\u201d I believe that we will see the same peaceful transition of American power this January because that is what this democracy is built upon and that is what all former first ladies would expect.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Angela Pupino is a junior at American University and the fall writing fellow for the Center for Community Change Action. The views expressed in this commentary are hers. Angela Pupino: As a millennial who sat out two elections, I understand how easy it is to stay on the sidelines But feeling \"helpless\" is exactly what makes voting so important, she writes I\u2019m currently at college in Washington, D.C., so I voted with an absentee ballot in my home county in Ohio. I\u2019m 20 years old, so this isn\u2019t the first election I could have voted in. But my excuses for not voting since I became eligible at 18 were numerous. Going to the DMV to register was too much of a hassle. I decided that I didn\u2019t care about local elections and down-ballot races. It was too difficult to register while I was away at school. Neither of my parents had voted since before I was born, so it couldn\u2019t be that important. I\u2019ve also heard countless excuses from those not voting in this year\u2019s elections. There\u2019s the familiar reasoning about not having time to register, or the registration process being too difficult (there is some truth to this, especially in marginalized communities). But there are also a new set of excuses from non-voters, especially those around my age. They don\u2019t like the major candidates. Their candidate is not on the ballot. Their vote won\u2019t matter because of where they live. No candidates prioritize the issues they care about. This first-time voter has a secret As a millennial who sat out two elections, I understand just how easy it is to stay on the sidelines. I understand doubting the ability of any politician to effect meaningful change, or make any change at all, in one term. I understand nationwide disillusionment with major party nominees. But what I can no longer understand is skipping out on the process entirely, especially with down-ballot races in play. What changed my mind about voting? It\u2019s more than just electing a president. I also need members of Congress who won\u2019t cut the Pell Grant funding that helps me pay for college. I need state representatives who will decide everything from whether police must wear body cameras to abortion access to funding for public health services. I need state school board members who will make decisions that have very real consequences for my little sister and brother, who are still students in Ohio\u2019s public schools. I need state and local judges and county sheriffs who will determine if justice is dispensed, or not dispensed, in my community. When I turned in my absentee ballot a few weeks ago, I voted on candidates for all of these positions. I\u2019ve talked to many of my peers who say that they feel powerless this election season. At times, I\u2019ve felt that way too. After video emerged of Donald Trump describing sexually assaulting women, and other women came forward to recount their personal experiences with the Republican presidential nominee, I watched helplessly as conversations all around me turned to the topic of sexual assault. Every news broadcast I saw, every minute spent browsing Facebook risked turning traumatic, with pundits and my relatives alike arguing about whether or not grabbing someone by the genitals was assault. As an assault survivor myself, I watched in horror during a debate as Trump himself urged questioners to get to \u201cmuch more important\u201d issues than sexual assault and the safety of victims.  I felt helpless. But this feeling of helplessness is exactly what makes voting so important. When I vote, I am looking at my values and deciding which candidates and issues best uphold those values. Voting gives me the chance to have my own personal referendum on the politicians and policies already in place. In an election cycle where coverage of sexual violence has enraged and saddened me, voting gives me the opportunity to select leaders who will work towards a world that is safer for people like me. In an election cycle where the needs of those living in poverty have not been a topic of much discussion, I can vote for leaders whose decisions will affect Medicaid, SNAP and other welfare programs in my state and across the nation. In an election cycle where so much of the rhetoric has been about people that I care deeply about \u2013 including my friends and colleagues who are people of color, Muslims and immigrants \u2013 voting allows me to select leaders who will work to right past and present wrongs, ensure that their safety and rights are upheld, and create a more equitable America.  All across the nation this fall, millions of my fellow Americans are also putting their values into action. That\u2019s not helplessness. That\u2019s power.",

He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Timothy Stanley: In contrast with his potential replacements, Obama sounds presidential He sees partisan militancy vs. power of archaic party machinery in choice for 2016 Barack Obama will probably leave office on a high. His weekly average approval rating now stands at 54%. Given the state of the economy and America\u2019s troubles overseas, the likely explanation is that voters are contrasting him favorably with the election candidates. One legacy of Donald Trump might be to give Obama a better legacy \u2013 a reminder of the calmer, simpler time that we all lived in 18 months ago. Of course, most presidents enjoy a bump in their final few weeks. Obama\u2019s is relatively small. Ronald Reagan stood at 63% despite Iran-Contra. Bill Clinton stood at 66% despite Monica Lewinsky. In their last year they become politically lame and thus \u2013 almost \u2013 apolitical. Yes, Obama has been campaigning hard for Hillary Clinton. But he\u2019s also chilled on TV with Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert and launched a nonpartisan and rather dazzling plan to reach Mars by the 2030s. He has finally come out as a Vulcan, as his moving tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy showed. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a surprise that Obama can get a positive approval rating at all. Cities have been aflame. Obamacare, the President\u2019s signature reform, is broadly disliked. Unemployment is low, but so is the labor force participation rate, indicating that many have stopped looking for work. Growth is sluggish; there are signs of a slowdown. Income inequality is a major issue. Trump has highlighted the loss of manufacturing jobs to foreign countries. And it\u2019s overseas that US troubles really appear stark. Chaos in Syria and Iraq has been exploited by Russia as part of a struggle for global authority that many fear America is losing. Many also feel the United States has gone soft on Iran. And a spate of terror attacks this year exposed how vulnerable the country remains 15 years after the collapse of the World Trade Center. There\u2019s also a case for saying that Obama accelerated the fracturing of American politics and the decline in mutual respect \u2013 that he, in some small way, helped create Clinton vs. Trump. Republicans complained he refused to work with them in Congress during his first term, and while one cannot really blame him for being a magnet for right-wing angst, his partisan style encouraged the Tea Party revolt that polarized the nation. The culture wars featured heavily in his 2012 re-election battle. Conservatives believe he played the liberal Nixon, splitting the country in two on same-sex marriage and abortion, and taking the larger half. He was the target of vicious Republican attacks in that election, no one would deny. But by labeling Mitt Romney \u2013 a self-evidently decent and rather moderate man \u2013 as a wicked rich guy, Obama\u2019s campaign contributed to the oratorical weaponization of US politics. In a world where Romney can be painted as an extremist, Trump\u2019s sins suddenly become normal. Just as repeated onscreen violence blunts the audience\u2019s reactions to it, so dirty campaigning in 2012 left many voters immune to slander and demagoguery. But Obama never personally raised his voice. His approach to politics is cool, logical and \u2013 this is crucial \u2013 never an embarrassment to the republic. It\u2019s a very low bar to note that he never was caught on tape saying that he loves kissing women and grabbing them and, hey, they never seem to say stop. But that\u2019s where the bar has been set \u2013 and Obama floats elegantly above it. I do not write this as a conservative going soft on the President. He has contributed to the decline of America, and I\u2019ve detailed why many times before. But he does have two qualities that voters will find absent from this campaign. Trump on whether election will be rigged: 'Ask Obama' He certainly beats Trump for intellectualism. Obama is not only intelligent but thoughtful \u2013 he clearly has a deep interior life and a preference for reason over instinct. It has been a pleasure to have a President who sounds like he\u2019s thought about what he\u2019s talking about. Second, Obama has a ring of authenticity that contrasts strongly with Clinton. His is a liberalism fostered by personal experience. Experience of being an outsider due to his race, of some knowledge of poverty and of the trial of not really knowing his father. Few presidents have been so nakedly autobiographical: The first time Americans encountered Obama on the national stage was through a frank memoir. And the rancorous debate about Obama\u2019s background \u2013 though ugly and silly \u2013 actually was emotionally affecting. Few of us come from perfect families. A president, like Bill Clinton, with some knowledge of pain is no bad thing. 4 truths about Obamacare The election in 2008 offered a divisive but high-quality choice to the American people. Obama was the best of his generation of liberals. John McCain was the most honorable man among conservatives. I\u2019d rather America had gone for the soldier over the community organizer \u2013 but the primary process probably had done its work well. This time around, the choice of Trump and Hillary Clinton betrays partisan militancy in one case and the power of archaic party machinery in the other. Trump often asserts that he\u2019ll win because polls show that folks don\u2019t approve of the direction of the country. What he fails to realize is that voters aren\u2019t only registering dissatisfaction with Obama\u2019s record \u2013 they are also disgusted with this campaign. As we slouch toward November 8, the President\u2019s approval rating may rise even further. Contrasted with his potential replacements he sounds \u2026 well, presidential.",

He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own. Issac Bailey: Conservative Christians distort Clinton's abortion position to give cover to their support of morally compromised Trump He says abortion has fallen in Obama tenure; Clinton's views on abortion reflect those of most Americans: they should be safe, rare Hillary Clinton does not want to kill all the little babies. She doesn\u2019t sanction the murder of the defenseless. Yet to hear conservative Christians who continue supporting Donald Trump tell it, they have no choice because Clinton is supposedly a threat to the unborn and doesn\u2019t value life. \u201cBecause based on what she is saying, and based on where she\u2019s going and where she\u2019s been, you can take a baby and rip the baby out of the womb. In the ninth month, on the final day and that\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d Trump roared during the final presidential debate, surely speaking directly to pro-lifers who might be skittish about him but won\u2019t even consider Clinton because of abortion. Some even complained that during the subsequent Alfred E. Smith dinner, the archbishop of the Diocese of New York was caught \u201claughing and joking with Hillary Clinton less than twenty-four hours after Hillary announced she supports abortion up to the moment of birth.\u201d First, she announced no such thing. It\u2019s nonsense. But this denunciation of Clinton, and support of Trump over the abortion issue, is a fig leaf many conservatives are using to hide their hypocrisy. Recall that this is a group of people who have long claimed that character matters, that they are guided by a higher power in everything they do and think, including their politics. And yet Trump has bragged about casually sexually assaulting women, an action (allegedly) confirmed by a growing list of victims. He has been buoyed to the top of GOP politics on a bigoted tide of birtherism. And in business he has repeatedly taken advantage of \u201cthe least of these\u201d instead of helping them. A new era for abortion rights? So the only way conservatives can back a man like Trump is by advancing the absurdity that each candidate is equally flawed \u2013 but only with one (Trump) would they have a chance at saving the little babies. They believe the falsehood about Clinton, pushed by Ted Cruz during the primary season, that she is in favor of unlimited abortion on demand \u201cup until the moment of birth.\u201d Clinton is a pro-choice Christian Democrat who supports a ban on partial birth abortion \u2013 if it comes with exceptions concerning the health of the mother. That\u2019s why she opposed the 2003 late-term abortion ban, because it didn\u2019t. (Only about 0.2 percent of all abortions involve the so-called dilation and extraction procedure, and mostly because of health concerns concerning the woman or fetus.) Clinton is on record declaring that she wants abortions to be safe but rare and decisions about them left to women and their doctors, not politicians. The policies she supports, including more comprehensive health care and health education, are among the reasons the abortion rate is at a historic low and could fall further if they are expanded \u2013 something Clinton wants to do. That the rate of abortion has been going down under this Democratic presidency, and that there is scant evidence that having a Republican in the White House would make it rarer, seems to matter little to conservative Christians, too many of whom are quick to label anyone \u201cbaby killer\u201d or \u201cpro-abortion\u201d for having the temerity to not see the world in the black-and-white terms they do. The irony, of course, is that when pressed, they are quick to acknowledge the obvious: The issue is complex, which is why so many anti-abortion groups spoke up when Trump said that women who have abortions, if they are made illegal, would need to be punished, forcing Trump to clarify and back off. They empathize with women who even have to consider aborting a fetus, they say, which is why it would make little sense to arrest and imprison any woman who does (though in a post Roe v. Wade world, they wouldn\u2019t mind punishing the doctor). Planned Parenthood president defends Kaine on abortion They say this while not appearing to recognize that such a stance proves that a two-week-old fetus is not the same, legally speaking, as a two-week-old infant. No one would excuse a mother of a two-week-old for killing her child, even if she handed off the act to a doctor, each of whom would be arrested and charged with murder. Understanding that a developing fetus is a developing human being, somewhere within the various stages between conception and birth, is not anti-life. Neither is having personal principles that say you would never sanction an abortion in your own life, but remain leery of governmental overreach into the lives of others. Conservatives\u2019 distortion of the pro-choice view held by many Democratic candidates helps explain how a man like Trump could make such inroads into a party that has long believed itself to be about family values. Misrepresenting the positions of political opponents does not seem to trouble conservative Christians when it is done in the name of being pro-life. Trump asks crowd if they're Christian conservatives In truth, Clinton\u2019s views on abortion are as complex as those of most Americans. Why? Because many Americans who don\u2019t like abortion feel it is a bridge too far to essentially turn over the body of a pregnant woman to the government for nine months, and that medical procedures are better left to the woman, her family and her doctor. That\u2019s not being pro-abortion; that\u2019s being pro-individual rights, something conservatives say they treasure except, apparently, when it comes to a woman and her body. I'm a feminist and I'm against abortion They may not know it, but those conservative Christians who continue to back Trump have sent messages that morality is contingent not upon right and wrong but upon whether you back the right political party; that adultery can be explained away; that lying about those with whom you disagree is perfectly fine; and that neither sexual assault nor open bigotry is reason to not support a candidate. Maybe in this calculation God should be written with a small \u201cg\u201d because a god whose image can be used to support one\u2019s every politically expedient position \u2013 even if that position flouts one\u2019s stated religious principles \u2013 isn\u2019t a god to be worshiped, but rather one to be pitied. Reports that the Trump campaign is working to suppress the votes of black Americans, young women and white liberals would mark the most rational move the Republican Party presidential nominee has made in months.",

He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Julian Zelizer: Clinton's ability to deliver power message might tilt Congress to Democrats She has chance to frame debate in a way that makes it clear what's at stake, he says Hillary Clinton is feeling pretty good about the election. Almost all of the polls have moved decisively in her favor, the debates were a \u201cdisaster\u201d for Donald Trump, and the GOP might be seriously at risk of losing control of the Senate and, just possibly, the House. During the third debate, Clinton once again demonstrated just how masterful she could be at the art of political combat, goading Trump into sharing his most provocative thoughts and mocking some of his most outlandish statements. There were moments when he seemed to be barely holding on as she went after his policies and personality. Clinton has also released a series of blistering ads that demolish Trump\u2019s temperament, policies and character. One recent ad compares Trump to all the famous Hollywood film bullies who have tormented their classmates. The ad concludes with a young girl asking Clinton what she would do about bullying as she explained how kids talked behind her back about her asthma. \u201cThat was really brave,\u201d Clinton says. At other moments Clinton has gone silent. During key parts of the debates and even on the campaign trail, she has stepped back, most likely just to let Trump be Trump. When your opponent\u2019s campaign is imploding, some experts believe, the best thing to do is watch. Yet there is a danger for Clinton and the Democrats if she sits out too much of the next two weeks and only focuses on landing the knockout blow that would make Trump unviable as a candidate. Not only does Clinton continue to suffer from low favorability ratings and distrust among Democrats, but her campaign has been overshadowed by the ongoing bluster and controversy of Trump. There has not been much political space for her to make a case to the American public about what she would do as president. Even in the final debate, where policy issues finally received some attention, the discussion was lost to Trump\u2019s remarkable claim that he would not necessarily accept the outcome of the election. The real point of Trump's Gettysburg speech Why does it matter that Clinton spends more time in the next two weeks articulating her agenda and campaigning around the kind of president that she aspires to be in the next four years? Why change course if the current strategy seems to be succeeding so well? The main reason for Clinton to define her agenda more aggressively is that if she wins she will have an extraordinarily narrow window of time during which to govern. Even Lyndon Johnson, in the aftermath of John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination and with the wind of the civil rights movement behind him, only had a two-year window through which to pass most of his Great Society legislation. Following the midterm elections of 1966, the wizard of American politics was not able to get much done on the domestic front. If Democrats regain control of the Congress, it might very well only last for two years. During that time, Republicans will use all the power of minority obstruction to block her initiatives. If Republicans keep control of Congress, they will have little interest in handing her any victory. Many experts expect that House Speaker Paul Ryan would face a narrower majority \u2013 which makes every vote count \u2013 and an expanded Freedom Caucus. Given those circumstances, it will be essential that Clinton is in the best position possible to take advantage of whatever opportunities emerge. The more that she can do to refine and sell an overall political vision going into the elections, the better positioned she will be at the start of a potential presidency. Given how little many Americans know about what she stands for, as opposed to her extensive experience and the flaws of her opponent, using this time on the national stage well will be essential.  If Clinton wants to make sure that the Obama coalition comes out to vote in large numbers, which would help to create the perception of a \u201cmandate\u201d in December and January, that coalition needs to know more about who they are supporting. It is not enough to not be Trump. The most energetic coalitions come forth, as was the case in 2008, when they have someone to believe in and a set of ideas for which to fight. This will also be important to counteract some of the skepticism that might emerge from any yet to be released WikiLeaks material. Clinton\u2019s ability to deliver a power message in the next few weeks might also help to push the scales toward a Democratic Senate and even a Democratic House. Right now, by most accounts, control of Congress could go either way, though Trump\u2019s performance in the last few weeks has opened the door to the possibility of a Democratic takeover. This is a moment where Clinton has an opportunity to help frame the debate in a way that makes clear to Democrats what\u2019s at stake in the election of a Democratic Congress, which would be essential to allow her to achieve her agenda. Right now, many of her supporters are not even sure what that agenda will be. Given the dynamics of the polls, there is actually the real possibility of an election that results in united government and creates the impression of a mandate for change. You won't have Trump to kick around anymore? There was a moment in the third debate that revealed the potential for Clinton to make this kind of case. She strongly defended the right of women to control their own bodies and decisions about abortion, and she condemned sexual assault and harassment as intolerable. Clinton, who is doing extremely well against Trump with female voters, revealed at that moment one of the most potent issues that she can use to frame her presidency. \u201cFor women, politics gets complicated when people try to place ownership on what a woman can and can\u2019t do with her body,\u201d said one undergraduate speaking to The New York Times, \u201cIt does reassure me to have a woman in office who understands what it\u2019s like to be a woman.\u201d Clinton does not want to end a successful campaign feeling like Bill McKay, the candidate played by Robert Redford in the 1972 film \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d who is urged by a political campaign professional named Marvin Lucas to run against an incumbent senator. The idealistic McKay runs an effective campaign and wins. In one of the most famous scenes, McKay and Lucas duck into a room as a horde of journalists try to get inside. As the journalists pry open the door and flood in to interview the victor, McKay asks: \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Lucas can\u2019t hear him, and he never gets an answer. Given the enormous stakes in this election and difficult governing environment that exists for both parties, Clinton can\u2019t afford to go into November without knowing her answer and with an electoral coalition that is not much more sure themselves.",

Trump video, some Republicans' denunciation of his treatment of women is opportunity for discussion, says Ruth Ben-Ghiat She says same men and women have long sought to control womens' bodies by overturning abortion rights Ben-Ghiat: Trump's talk and actions might also prompt us to reexamine our notions of American masculinity Once again, courtesy of Donald Trump and the Republican Party, women\u2019s bodies are headline news in this election. We\u2019ve heard him talk about how women are supposed to look and act. We\u2019ve heard him demean and humiliate women and call them disgusting, pigs and slobs. We\u2019ve seen him dissect the physical ailments and qualities of Hillary Clinton the way he would a farm or laboratory animal. Now we\u2019re drilling down, as it were, to the female parts Trump seems to care most about: not brains and hearts, but bottoms and breasts and vaginas. The first two are the hot buttons of femininity. Ask any plastic surgeon, including the one Trump liked to take his girlfriends to, or launch any adult video game or website. The last two, breasts and vaginas, are the givers of life. In them resides the immense power of the female sex, and around them a world of male anxiety and political struggle. Trump is not alone in finding breastfeeding and menstruation frightening \u2013 or, as he is more likely to put it, \u201cdisgusting.\u201d This situation presents an opportunity. The historic encounter between a misogynist everyman and the first female major-party nominee for president is the perfect time to open a dialogue about gender relations that can sustain our scarred nation long after the votes are counted. Sorry, Donald and Rudy, most men don't talk like that A first talking point is the most politically charged: the rights of women to control their own bodies. GOP leaders have finally admitted that Trump\u2019s deep-seated hostility to women presents a challenge to governance. You can\u2019t speak for the American people if you despise half of them. Yet there\u2019s irony, if not rank hypocrisy, in Republicans who are suddenly insisting \u2013 because they have daughters  \u2013 that they find Trump\u2019s attitude  toward women indefensible. These same men and women have long sought to control womens\u2019 bodies by advocating the destruction of pro-choice organizations such as Planned Parenthood. Abortion has hardly been discussed in this campaign, but it remains perhaps the last unbroken mast of the GOP\u2019s sinking ship. The Republicans now making a show of defending womens\u2019 dignity might acknowledge the contradiction between saying that it\u2019s bad to grab vaginas, but necessary to subject them to government authority. That could be a basis for starting a dialogue.  Then there\u2019s the matter of how slow institutions have been to address workplace harassment in a meaningful way. Trump is a case in point: His very long history of accusations of molesting and humiliating women on the job was known to the GOP leadership, who resolutely stuck by him no matter what. Many corporations and enterprises have Trumps who are harbored at the expense of employee well-being and productivity \u2013 and it\u2019s important to note that men also fall prey to this, including by bosses who are closeted. Real reason Republicans are ditching Trump? It's white women The GOP has acted in a similar way, sheltering Trump, even through the Roger Ailes blowout at Fox, because it was against their interests to do otherwise. Women are now speaking up in unprecedented numbers about their situations. Let\u2019s hear back from American institutions and businesses on the matter. Finally, Trump\u2019s talk and actions might prompt us to re-examine our notions of American masculinity. What kind of men are we teaching boys to be? Trump, who incarnated to millions the male ideal of success, must be plenty frustrated at the sudden backlash. Donald Trump's empire He earned the nomination for being exactly who he\u2019s always been: a charismatic leader in the boardroom and, he says, the bedroom, and an \u201calpha male\u201d who seduced Americans with promises of a firm hand. Gov. Mike Pence may be backpedaling from his running mate now, but he used to be impressed by what he called, over and over, Trump\u2019s \u201cbroad-shouldered\u201d  \u2013 that is, manly \u2014 leadership. The Trump tape doesn't matter Trump will be Trump was the mantra of many of his GOP supporters. This is what men do and say, in the locker room, on the sports field, and according to his disgraced aide and defender Corey Lewandowski, around the dinner table as well. In all these places, boys learn to be men. They listen to how we speak about ourselves, about each other, and about women. However this election goes, and whatever our politics, most Americans would probably agree it\u2019s unhelpful to have derogatory language about women streaming forth from every form of media, initiating girls and boys into the world of sexism extra early. Trump\u2019s not going to change but we can use this fraught election to open a national conversation about how to do better. It can\u2019t be hard to go up from here.",

She is a registered nurse and a board member of the Jed Foundation, a national mental health advocacy organization. She is also a donor to the Clinton campaign. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Lynn O'Connor Vos: First presidential debate left one key domestic issue out: the state of American health care Moderators in the forthcoming debates must push the candidates to define and defend their health care platforms As America decides on its next president, two critical domestic issues are at stake \u2013 the economy and health care. In their first debate, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spoke at length on one: the economy. But how much time was devoted to the other? Absolutely none. Unless you consider Donald Trump\u2019s possible symptoms \u2013 sniffling, fatigue, dehydration \u2013 which suggest that his own health may have been partially compromised. And though a candidate\u2019s health is important, the health of more than 300 million Americans is even more significant and worthy of discussion in the remaining presidential debates. In mid-summer, the Pew Research Center reported that 74% of Americans consider health care a critical issue in this election cycle. (Only the economy, terrorism and foreign policy scored higher.) Because it is an issue that affects every American, concern over health care is notably also bipartisan and steady across age groups. Though Obamacare reforms have slowed the rise of health care costs, added 20 million people to the ranks of the insured and created a revolution in health care information, there are still glitches in the system. The next president will be expected to guide the repair process \u2013 and at the first debate we did not get to hear about that process. We need to going forward. Hillary Clinton on health care: CNN's Reality Check vets the claims No one is happier with Obamacare than Clinton is. She says she will build on the Democrats\u2019 success and implement steps to improve on what we have, making the good even better. She has proposed several concrete steps to improve on Obamacare. Among them are tax credits to help with out-of-pocket medical expenses, offering more people the option of choosing the lower-cost Medicare system, stricter government oversight of prescription drug pricing and improved reimbursement and delivery of mental health care, including suicide prevention and mental health training for police. So far, the main thing we know about Trump\u2019s approach to health care is that he intends to immediately scrap Obamacare. Over and over again he has promised to \u201cend Obamacare and replace it with something terrific,\u201d but he has said almost nothing about how this would be accomplished. Donald Trump on health care: CNN's Reality Check team vets the claims There is no way to simply roll back all of Obamacare without creating complete chaos. Indeed, so many people \u2013 so many voters \u2013 benefit from its provisions, including 20 million Americans who have been added to the insurance rolls under Obamacare and millions of others who have enjoyed benefits under provisions that expand coverage for families and individuals. Given those numbers, Republicans in Congress will hesitate to act as rashly as Trump would like. When he does offer a bit more detail on his health care policy, Trump recycles points made in a debate that ended long ago. He says efficiencies can be realized if health plans are sold across state lines, but insurance companies are already permitted to sell in whatever state they choose. He wants Medicaid block grants to give states spending flexibility, but the states already enjoy lots of power to tailor Medicaid to local needs and reduce regulations on drug companies. Clinton has invested substantial time and energy into health care issues. Her website credits her work in health care as beginning in 1979, when she became chair of the Arkansas Rural Health Advisory Committee, a team working to expand health care access within the state. She was the driving force behind the attempted health care reform in her husband\u2019s administration and when it failed helped push the Child Health Care Program through Congress. As senator, she also made it possible for 9/11 responders to receive the health care they needed, and in 2009, she helped the Obama administration push through its sweeping reforms. In the current campaign, she has devoted considerable time on the campaign trail to explaining her health care platform. Besides his opposition to Obamacare, Trump has addressed health only as it pertains to his opponent. During the first debate, he said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the stamina. I said she doesn\u2019t have the stamina. And I don\u2019t believe she has the stamina to be president of this country you need tremendous stamina.\u201d This sexist statement echoes the Trump campaign\u2019s ongoing effort to substitute innuendo for a discussion of health care issues that impact millions of Americans. Instead of saying how he will help more Americans access affordable quality care, he has dispatched Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York, to say Clinton looks \u201ctired\u201d and \u201csick\u201d and urged voters to search the internet for information about her condition. Donald Trump: John Roberts made 'terrible' decisions on health care In fact, following a few days of rest after a bout with pneumonia, Clinton appeared vibrant and alert both before and during the debate, which notably required her to stand in the camera\u2019s glare for more than the expected 90 minutes. In contrast, Trump sniffled, gulped water and peered at moderator Lester Holt with eyes that looked puffy and exhausted. Although viewers may have been distracted by Trump\u2019s references to Clinton\u2019s \u201cstamina\u201d and by his own possible sickly symptoms, they are genuinely concerned about access, cost and quality of health care. They consider it vital to the well-being of their families and communities. Americans also understand that the country faces serious public health problems, including growing rates of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. As such, they want answers \u2013 and they want them now \u2013 about how the next president will improve a still broken health care system. Ever since Franklin D. Roosevelt showed that a determined and vigorous disabled man could be chief executive, presidents have served as health role models for the nation. With the exception of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, who considered politics their sport, most have been eager to demonstrate their fitness. Jimmy Carter took to the tennis court. George W. Bush biked. Bill Clinton (now a vegan) balanced his Big Macs with running. Barack Obama badgers his aides about exercise. Clinton is a woman of normal weight for her height. She works out three to four times per week, practices yoga and, unlike Trump, isn\u2019t a big fan of fast food. In addition to the bottle of hot sauce she always keeps in her purse (to boost her immune system), Clinton eats mainly fish and vegetables. As secretary of state and as a presidential candidate, Clinton has demonstrated remarkable stamina. Nothing in her records supports Trump\u2019s insinuations. And while conspiracy-minded bloggers like to speculate about her condition, there\u2019s no evidence that she is any less fit, physically speaking, than Trump. In contrast, Trump\u2019s health habits should cause concern. At age 70, he is the son of a man who developed Alzheimer\u2019s and died with it. As the Alzheimer\u2019s Association reports, exercise of the sort Trump avoids and a diet far healthier than Trump\u2019s \u2013   which he says is heavy on junk food \u2013  can help forestall dementia. More importantly, good health habits preserve and improve the brain\u2019s functions. Trump, who has said his IQ is \u201cvery high, one of the highest,\u201d should take note. Health care heroes you should know about More important than the president\u2019s physical health will be his or her leadership. The United States spends more on health care as a percentage of its economy than any other industrialized nation. A study published in June in Lancet estimated that poor health habits cost the U.S. $28 billion in expenses and lost productivity. Worldwide, the figure was set at $68 billion, with $10 billion paid directly by individuals. What does that money buy? Not much. According to a study published by the Commonwealth Fund, a dozen comparable countries enjoy a higher life expectancy. (Australians live, on average, three years longer than Americans.) America is bested by the same dozen in measure of infant mortality, obesity and chronic conditions. The data suggest that with the right policies we can make improvements so that we live longer and better. For instance, the mortality rate in Massachusetts declined substantially in the four years after the state enacted a law mandating universal health care coverage, providing the model for the Affordable Care Act. But we need to know if the candidates are up to the job. The Pew report that found high voter interest in health care also noted that it is more important to voters than issues like guns, trade, Supreme Court appointments or abortion. So far, we haven\u2019t heard enough, especially from Trump, to determine whether the next president will be up to the challenge of health care reform.  In the two remaining debates, we need to hear specific plans for improving health care, especially from the candidate who hasn\u2019t offered any. Are you listening, moderators?

Michael D'Antonio: Trump employs these tricks because he is still a child at heart, never having matured into adulthood Americans are beginning to catch on to Donald Trump's rhetorical tricks, he says America seems to be catching onto the flaws of \u201cTrumpspeak\u201d \u2013 the GOP candidate\u2019s method, perfected over decades in the public eye, of winning attention and creating an illusion of unbounded success. Polls in key swing states and nationally now show him well behind Hillary Clinton and some of his rhetorical tricks, like the use of \u201cpeople are saying\u201d to spread falsehoods while avoiding responsibility for them, have become popular memes. Still, anything can happen with nearly three months left to go in the election. So it\u2019s instructive to look at the five elements of Trumpspeak: The media record is littered with moments when Donald Trump appeared to set a new mark for outrageousness that even he couldn\u2019t surpass. Then came another day and a new bizarre performance. The current example of the presidential candidate at his Trumpiest is the argument that President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the \u201cfounder\u201d and \u201cco-founder\u201d of ISIS. In the uproar that followed, Trump has been criticized even by the former Central Intelligence Agency director Michael Hayden, a Republican. But he brushed off the chance to explain his charge in a more sophisticated way because, as he told radio host Hugh Hewitt, \u201cEveryone\u2019s liking it.\u201d Predictably, the next day he complained that CNN had failed to realize his naming Obama the founder of ISIS was \u201csarcasm.\u201d It was more a case of extreme hyperbole. But no matter what you call it, Trump\u2019s statement gained press attention, which is what he so often wants. GOP, make Donald Trump take a 'time-out' In Trump\u2019s world, public attention, even when it\u2019s negative, has tremendous value. He explained this to one of his casino executives, John O\u2019Donnell, during the tabloid sex scandal that ended his marriage. As O\u2019Donnell reported, Trump rejected his counsel to \u201clay low,\u201d insisting, \u201cThis is good for business. Trust me. I know.\u201d  He also said, \u201cThis\u2019ll bring all the men in. They are going to want to be with Trump.\u201d At a rally this summer in Virginia, Trump heard a baby cry and at first, he offered warm reassurance to the mother, earning the crowd\u2019s admiration. But Trump suddenly reversed himself, expressing discomfort and inviting his listeners to join him in humiliating the mother. \u201cI think she really believed me,\u201d he said mockingly. In this odd sequence of events, Trump was able to win approval for expressing kindness and then establish his superiority by reversing his stance entirely. In capsule form, Trump\u2019s run-in with Rally Baby demonstrated his lifelong propensity for taking both sides of an issue. He has been a Democrat, an independent and a Republican. At one time Trump considered the question of abortion and declared himself \u201cvery pro-choice.\u201d Now he says he is against all abortions except in cases of incest and to save a mother\u2019s life. Trump mocking a mother: Big mistake Trump is no less wavering when it comes to claims about himself. In 1987, he said he believes \u201cthe simplest approach is often the most effective.\u201d Ten years later he said, \u201cIt\u2019s always good to do things nice and complicated so that nobody can figure it out.\u201d In 2011, he said he doesn\u2019t try to be provocative. In 2014, he said, \u201cI do love provoking people.\u201d He has claimed, alternately, that he reads \u201ca lot\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t read much\u201d and that he find travel boring but also \u201ctoo fantastic to miss out on.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump has sometimes seemed to contradict himself in the same sentence as when he told Fox last May, \u201cI don\u2019t want to have guns in classrooms, although in some cases teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly.\u201d A month earlier, Trump offered a more succinct contradiction when he answered a question from MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews about the use of nuclear weapons in Europe. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to use nuclear, but I\u2019m not taking any cards off the table.\u201d Trump, Clinton and our nuclear wake-up call Trump\u2019s recent controversies include a prime example of another rhetorical habit \u2013 the false claim. In this case, Trump said the National Football league had sent him a letter expressing concern about the timing of presidential debates scheduled for nights when football games would be on TV. The problem was the NFL denied ever sending such a letter. The alleged NFL fabrication fits into a pattern Trump established in the 1970s and 80s. His very first real estate project, a massive renovation of the Commodore Hotel at Grand Central Terminal, hinged on what appeared to be a deception. Asked to prove to the City of New York that he owned the rights to redevelop the site, which then belonged to the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad, Trump submitted a contract that supposedly established that he did. If city officials had looked closely, they would have seen that the papers weren\u2019t signed and were thus not valid. Either they didn\u2019t look or they didn\u2019t care, because Trump says he won the city\u2019s support for the job. Rewarded for his trickery, Trump embarked on a decades-long practice of making claims that were either impossible to check or verifiably false. When he built Trump Tower, which he said was more stories high than it is, Trump said that members of British royal family were interested in buying homes there. Trump on 9/11 claim: 'I'm not going to take it back' No proof was offered, and they never did. Before he was forced to sell his Trump Shuttle airline, he claimed, without evidence, that competitor Pan Am was unable to maintain its planes as well as his company did. Later came claims, made as he adopted a fake persona, that all sorts of famous and glamorous women sought to date him. According to a deposition, he then inflated a 30 percent stake in a Manhattan development to 50 percent, and repeatedly insisted that his wealth was far greater than outside experts estimated. In his pursuit of the presidency, Trump said he saw Muslims celebrating in New Jersey after the attacks on America of September 11, 2001. \u201cI watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering,\u201d said Trump. No law enforcement officials or media ever reported such celebrations and, after Trump made this claim, he was widely refuted. Informed of the facts, Trump nevertheless insisted the celebration \u201cwas on television. I saw it.\u201d He has never backed away from this claim. Although Trump routinely attacks the press for its supposed bias, he consistently promotes arguments with little basis in fact and no specific sources. With phrases like \u201cmany people are saying\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m hearing,\u201d Trump manages to insert unsubstantiated notions into the electoral discourse without taking responsibility for the messages he\u2019s sending. I experienced Trump\u2019s \u201cpeople are saying\u201d method when I interviewed him, and he told me that \u201ca lot of people are saying\u201d that he should run for president. In a variation of this theme, he said that an unnamed police detective told him that the settlement with the exonerated men in the Central Park jogger cases was \u201cthe heist of the century.\u201d With this argument, he was able to smear the men by citing the authority of a detective without producing any evidence. How Obama 'ridiculed' Trump's birther questions Prior to the current election season, Trump used variations on \u201cpeople are saying\u201d to maintain the so-called \u201cBirther\u201d attack on Obama. Long after others abandoned the effort to challenge the president\u2019s citizenship, Trump said, \u201cOur current president came out of nowhere. Came out of nowhere. In fact, I\u2019ll go a step further. The people that went to school with him never saw him; they don\u2019t know who he is. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Trump\u2019s innuendo had no basis in fact. When he spoke, the president\u2019s short form birth record had been released by officials in Hawaii, and there was no mystery about his college years. Nevertheless, Trump built a following with this method and continues to use it. Just days ago, he declared that \u201cmany people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hacked emails.\u201d In fact, no public source has linked Clinton to the execution of the Iranian scientist. During the primary season, Trump made his record of success in state contests into an argument for people continuing to support him. After winning in the Nevada caucuses, Trump went so far as to brag about how he received the most votes even among the least educated voters. \u201cI love the poorly educated!\u201d he crowed in his victory address. In the same speech, he pledged to win many big victories for the United States. \u201cWe\u2019re going to grab and grab and grab,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring in so much money and so much everything.\u201d Long before he became a politician, Trump pitched himself as a success to business partners, investors and American consumers. He has made these claims despite massive corporate bankruptcies that forced losses upon stockholders and bond investors, and left contractors holding unpaid bills. In total, his companies discharged an estimated $4.7 billion in debt. This is the record of a man who told Rolling Stone that he\u2019s running for president because the country is \u201cessentially bankrupt, and it needs a successful businessman.\u201d In addition to touting his success in business, where his record is decidedly mixed, Trump made a habit of insisting that he was a far bigger draw on television than he ever was. Trump used to pressure the publicist for \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with demands that he tout the programs high ratings even when the show was not at the top. Last year, he told a group of TV industry reporters that his show \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d was number one in the ratings. When challenged on this claim, he corrected himself and said it was top on the night it was broadcast. Corrected again, he offered the excuse, \u201cThat\u2019s just what I had heard.\u201d How is it that someone who cares so much about numbers as represented in his business record and ratings comes to declare himself a winner in ways that can be so readily refuted?  It\u2019s possible that the template was established so long ago that it\u2019s an ingrained habit. The scary road that Donald Trump is walking When I interviewed Trump, he told me more than once that in his youth he had been the best high school baseball player in New York State. In those years, the Empire State was home to several future major leaguers and at least one future Hall of Famer. The players who competed in big city leagues played against the toughest opponents. Trump played for a tiny school that squared-off against other small schools in Upstate New York. The chance that he was \u201cthe best\u201d is practically zero. Where Trump may in fact be an uncontested champion is in the arena of self-promotion and denigration of others. Beginning in the early 1970s, he offered himself as the picture of a successful young mogul, and certain credulous media outlets accepted his claim. When he began to make enemies, he defined them as untrustworthy. In the 1980s, he called New York City Mayor Ed Koch a \u201cmoron\u201d and \u201ca disaster.\u201d He went on to establish a long record of calling people fat, ugly, disgusting and \u201closers.\u201d Women who criticize him, including Bette Midler, Cher and Rosie O\u2019Donnell, have all been on the receiving ends of his insults. Never one to be outdone in any contest, Trump likes to respond to looming failures by saying he\u2019s being treated unfairly. This is a constant refrain when he talks about the press who, in his view, are \u201cslime,\u201d \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cdishonest.\u201d At his rallies, he often instructs his supporters to turn and look at the reporters covering the campaign while he describes them as his enemies. Although he usually confines himself to complaints about the press in general, Trump attacked MSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur by name. Taking issue with something Tur had reported, Trump pointed at her and said, \u201cWhat a lie. Katy Tur. What a lie it was. Third. Rate. Reporter. Remember that.\u201d  The Secret Service agents at the event were so concerned for her safety that they escorted Tur to her car when the rally was over. Last week, the man who cruised through an endless series of primaries and caucuses began to warn that the election could be rigged. Speaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity he said, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, November 8, we\u2019d better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it\u2019s going to be taken away from us.\u201d Trump offered no evidence to support his prediction, and the United States has had such a long and deep history of above-board elections that his suggestion is ridiculous. However, this is a claim he has made before. Prior to the Republican National Convention, Trump began to complain about how the party operated. \u201cIt\u2019s a rigged system. It\u2019s a crooked system; it\u2019s 100 percent crooked,\u201d he said. Trump stopped talking this way when it seemed certain he would get the nomination, and as he accepted his victory, no mention was made about how the party was operated unfairly. Trump sometimes pairs the unfair complaint with a trap door strategy that gives him a face-saving chance to escape humiliation if he spies an imminent defeat. In one such case, involving a golf course development in Scotland, he said that he would leave the project partially completed if the government approved an offshore wind power project. At the time, the world was in the midst of the recent recession and demand for luxury gold villas dried up. Trump got to stop building, though, without acknowledging that he was bested by conditions he did not anticipate. Instead he blamed the power project. Similarly, Trump\u2019s current warnings that the presidential election could be rigged is a trap door he can use should be go down in defeat. For years, Trump\u2019s critics and allies have been frustrated by his style. On Friday, supporter Newt Gingrich said his candidate doesn\u2019t seem to understand that he must speak with care. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s frustrating about his candidacy is the imprecise language,\u201d Gingrich said on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cHe sometimes uses three words when he needs 10.\u201d Gingrich cited the comments about Obama and ISIS as an example. \u201cI know what Trump has in his mind, but that\u2019s not what people hear,\u201d said Gingrich.  In a rare case of self-correction, Trump explained that he was practicing \u201csarcasm\u201d when he linked Obama to the founding of ISIS. He offered the same explanation when he mused about how Russian hackers should muck around in Clinton\u2019s email accounts. Trump is just being Trump Trump\u2019s excuses, like his behavior, resemble what one might expect from a bullying child who is caught tormenting a sibling. Any adult who has ever interceded in this kind of conflict knows to expect to hear \u201cI was only kidding\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d from the kid who is doing the harm. In Trump\u2019s case, of course, the childishness does harm to the country as a whole and, as the case of Tur suggests, poses a real threat to specific individuals. Trump is the same person he was as a boy. \u201cWhen I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I\u2019m basically the same,\u201d Trump once told me. \u201cThe temperament is not that different.\u201d Having studied Trump intently over the last three years, I would agree that he\u2019s the same person he was as a child, but I would peg the exact date to the summer between seventh and eighth grade. It was then that his parents, exasperated over his behavior, sent him away to a military academy because they couldn\u2019t handle him. There he was plunged into a cruel and often violent environment where grown men trained young men by smacking them around. In the meantime, his four siblings were comforted in the luxury of the Trump mansion, peacefully attended by domestic help and educated at posh private schools. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Trump was, by his own admission, an out-of-control child, and he says that he needed the discipline he got at the military academy. I agree, but I don\u2019t think the discipline took. This is what the more sober minded elders of the GOP, Gingrich included, are discovering now. Trump is still the unruly child who will not be tamed. The chances of him accepting discipline now, at age 70, after a lifetime of accumulating wealth, power and attention, are slim to none. Michael D\u2019Antonio is the author of the new book, \u201cThe Truth About Trump.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Will Bunch is a columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News and author of \u201cTear Down This Myth: The Right-Wing Distortion of the Reagan Legacy\u201d and the recent e-book, \u201cThe Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Will Bunch: Howard Stern was progenitor of Donald Trump's MO, with offensive statements, low, often sexualized, humor Trump appeared on Stern show repeatedly, appealed to Stern's \"un-PC\" audience Bunch: At one time, Trump comments might have disqualified him for presidency; instead they appear to have helped him The critics thought he\u2019d ended his career when it had just barely started \u2013 thanks to one outrageous and offensive comment. It was 1982, a year when the phrase \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d was familiar to only a handful of people, and Donald Trump was barely known beyond Manhattan real-estate insiders. And the hottest up-and-coming morning disc jockey in the Washington market was a young man with a long face, even longer hair and an acid tongue. Howard Stern. Stern was known as over the top, but even his fans gasped that January morning when the DJ pretended to call a representative of Air Florida, just one day after its jet had crashed into D.C.\u2019s 14th Street Bridge, killing 78 people. Could he buy a one-way ticket to the bridge? he asked in a mocking tone. Would the 14th Street crossing become a permanent stop? Keep Trump comments in perspective That was possibly the last straw for Stern\u2019s bosses at Washington\u2019s WWDC, and he was ousted a few months later. But a career killer? Hardly. Stern re-emerged later that year in the Big Apple at the 50,000-watt WNBC. There, he continued to soar in the ratings and took his radio show national, even as he gave station directors migraines with his sexualized content and bad taste. He made jokes, for example, about the death of pop star Selena and the Columbine massacre. Stern wasn\u2019t trying to start a revolution, and his interest in politics \u2013 to the extent that he had any \u2013 was one-part libertarian and three parts libertine. But in creating a culture around shutting down what his mainly young, white, male listeners saw as the sacred cows of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d \u2013 whether it was sexual taboos or the pomposity of American elites \u2013 Stern and the generation of radio \u201cshock jocks\u201d he inspired built the foundation of a revolt. Its target would be traditional politicians, and it would be led by one of Stern\u2019s frequent guests: Donald Trump. This summer, after tapping into the very same zeitgeist that launched Stern to prominence three decades ago, Trump stunned the world by claiming the Republican presidential nomination at the party\u2019s convention in Cleveland. At July\u2019s GOP confab, attentive viewers heard echoes of a Stern-Trump \u201cbromance\u201d forged in New York in the 1980s and \u201990s \u2013 from the flow of B-list celebrities like Scott Baio to the over-the-top taunting of Hillary Clinton, punctuated by frequent chants of \u201clock her up.\u201d Trump\u2019s unapologetic slam of a Muslim couple whose soldier son was killed in Iraq is the most recent demonstration of his willingness to push into the territory of taboo and tastelessness. Why Trump is lashing out over debates Some of the seeds were planted a couple of decades ago when Trump appeared on Stern\u2019s program repeatedly to, among other things, offer his crude locker-room observations such as whether he\u2019d \u201cbang\u201d women such as Princess Diana (who had just died in a horrific car crash) or Mariah Carey, his views on \u201cboob jobs,\u201d flat-chested women and oral sex \u2013 spiked with boasts about his sexual prowess. In an earlier time, just one of Trump\u2019s comments might have disqualified him for the presidency; that low bathroom humor only seems to have led The Donald to this moment. Indeed, in his raucous rallies and the continuous, frenzied loop of TV interviews and call-ins on the road to the nomination, Trump has modified the bawdy image transmitted by his fellow 1980s New York icon to fit the political screen: unbelievably outrageous and sometimes offensive comments, delivered heedless of any fallout;  regular shtick and repeated one-liners (\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d \u201cGet \u2018im out of here!\u201d) that fans wait for \u2014 clamor for \u2013 at every show; radio-ready nicknames for everyone from \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d to \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d and a series of never-ended feuds. In 1994, Stern told Rolling Stone that the white, young-adult, mostly suburban males listening to his show and mobbing his book signings by the thousands were \u201csort of the skeptical, cynical, I-don\u2019t believe-a-f***in\u2019-thing-I-hear people.\u201d In 2016, that Stern fan is two decades older and probably has a Trump bumper sticker on his SUV.  Some younger voters are lined up, too.  One 22-year-old Trump backer recently told The Atlantic that his motivation is rebelling against what he called \u201cultra\u201d political correctness \u201cwhere it\u2019s almost impossible to have polite or constructive political discussion.  Disagreement gets you labeled fascist, racist, bigoted, etc.\u201d But something important has changed since Stern first rolled out his brand: The lines between pure politics and pure entertainment became so blurred that it is impossible now to tell where one ends and the other begins. In the 1990s and 2000s, AM talk radio, which co-opted Stern\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d tactics to promote a conservative ideology, assumed de facto leadership of the Republican Party. That trend accelerated after President Obama\u2019s 2008 election, with the surge of the tea party and its broadcast prophets \u2013 such as Glenn Beck, a former Stern-styled DJ. A political candidate like Trump, who wooed voters by keeping them riled up and entertained, much like a \u201cMorning Zoo\u201d jock chasing ratings, was merely the next logical step. The amazing part is that way back in 1985 \u2013 the year Stern conquered the New York airwaves and a brash young Trump was best known for breaking apart the upstart USFL football league \u2013 one prophet predicted today\u2019s political crisis. That prophet\u2019s name was Neil Postman, a New York University professor and media critic. His landmark book \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death\u201d predicted that schlock entertainment values would eventually strangle American democracy like a cluster of poison ivy. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Postman\u2019s thesis was that the ominous warnings of an Orwellian future, complete with totalitarian censorship, had badly missed the mark. \u201cCensorship, after all, is the tribute tyrants pay to an assumption that the public knows the difference between serious discourse and entertainment \u2013 and cares,\u201d the media theorist wrote. \u201cHow delighted would all the kings, czars and fuhrers of the past and commissars of the present be to know that censorship is not a necessity when all political discourse takes the form of a jest.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that Trump has ever read \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death,\u201d but his ascent would not have surprised Postman (who died in 2002). Indeed, in 1994 Stern himself took an early baby step down the trail now blazed by Trump by running for governor of New York as a Libertarian on a simplistic and populist platform (pro-death penalty, anti-traffic) \u2013 a high-profile bid that was aborted due to Stern\u2019s refusal to meet the state\u2019s financial-disclosure requirement. Warren Buffett erases Donald Trump's excuses on taxes Trump has merely expanded on that model \u2013 offering himself as a savvy and fabulously wealthy business leader, spinning out the kind of loose, provocative and offensively entertaining talk that would fit right in on Stern\u2019s radio program, even after it moved to satellite radio where cursing and cruder content is allowed. With the nomination in hand, only November\u2019s general election voters can prevent what would have been Neil Postman\u2019s worst nightmare: an American government worthy not of applause but a laugh track, driven less by substance than the desire for higher Nielsen ratings. The biggest irony, though, is that the moral godfather of this counter-revolution may not be a part of it. Howard Stern has marveled at Trump\u2019s political instincts, telling his listeners last year that voters clearly \u201clike the idea of a successful businessman running the country who might actually be able to get s*** done.\u201d But as a strong supporter of abortion rights, Stern has also signaled that he may vote for Hillary Clinton in the fall.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Waldman is a senior writer with The American Prospect, a left-leaning magazine, and a blogger for The Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Paul Waldman: It was mistake for Ruth Bader Ginsburg to slam Trump, but she did it because he is a threat to democracy He says she has devoted life to upholding Constitution; her issue with Trump is about more than political differences Donald Trump has a way of making ordinarily reasonable people get over-agitated. His campaign for the presidency has been decried not just by Democrats but by Republicans, foreign leaders, writers and artists and actors, and now Supreme Court justice and pop culture icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg. When Ginsburg criticized Trump in a few interviews earlier this week, the overwhelming reaction, even from those who admire her as a jurist, was that she had made a mistake. But was she wrong? Supreme Court justices are supposed to be above partisanship, at least pretending not to be concerned with who wins an election. After all, we wouldn\u2019t want Clarence Thomas speaking at the Republican convention or Sonia Sotomayor out stumping with Hillary Clinton; that would undercut the legitimacy of the court as the final arbiter of legal disputes, many of which involve the President and the administration. After a couple of days of criticism, Ginsburg released a statement saying, \u201cOn reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised and I regret making them,\u201d because \u201cJudges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect.\u201d We all understand that Supreme Court justices care about partisan contests, since they have ideological preferences just like anyone else. Ruth Bader Ginsburg apparently wants Clinton to win, just as her colleagues may well want someone else to win. But if one of the other candidates had become the Republican nominee, there\u2019s no way she would have made these kind of remarks. She didn\u2019t do it because of Trump\u2019s plan to cut taxes for the wealthy, his proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or his opposition to abortion rights. All the other candidates shared those positions. She did it because Trump presents a unique threat to democracy itself, one that stands outside ideological and partisan differences. Ruth Bader Ginsburg's slam of Trump Trump is that kind of threat not because he knows virtually nothing about policy (though that\u2019s true), or because he\u2019s crass and crude (also true) or because he lies constantly (undeniable). He\u2019s a threat because he rejects so many of the basic ideas on which our democracy is based. He talks about \u201copen[ing] up the libel laws\u201d so he can sue news organizations to punish them for being critical of him. He has spoken again and again not just about his admiration for dictators, but his approval of their most brutal methods. When he says about North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, \u201cYou gotta give him credit\u201d for taking over the government and killing his uncle, it\u2019s not a surprise, because we\u2019ve already heard him praise Vladimir Putin\u2019s strong leadership, show his admiration for Saddam Hussein\u2019s ability to kill terrorists without the inconvenience of legal proceedings, and extol the virtues of the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square (\u201cWhen the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious. They were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength\u201d). Trump has been even more specific about his intention to not just break U.S. law but literally commit war crimes. He expresses his regret that ISIS chops off people\u2019s heads, but in America we have laws we have to obey that prevent us from reacting in kind. He promises to begin using torture on prisoners once again (including \u201ca hell of a lot worse than waterboarding\u201d), despite the fact that both U.S. law and international treaties to which we are a signatory prohibit it. He proposes that we should not only go after terrorists but kill their families, which is not just a war crime but an act so horrifically immoral that it should have destroyed his candidacy the moment the suggestion slithered from his mouth. So one can understand why someone who has devoted her life to studying, interpreting and upholding the Constitution of the United States would conclude that Donald Trump is not just a candidate with whom she has political differences, but something altogether different. And when Trump responded to her criticisms by tweeting, \u201cJustice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!\u201d he demonstrated what she was talking about. It may be a breach of decorum for a Supreme Court justice to criticize a presidential candidate, but it\u2019s much worse for someone who would be President to call a justice feebleminded and press her to step down. You can still argue that Ginsburg should have kept her opinion to herself, and I wouldn\u2019t disagree. The way she did it wasn\u2019t going to persuade anyone who didn\u2019t already agree, and there\u2019s value in at least maintaining the appearance that Supreme Court justices are above partisan politics. But Ginsburg\u2019s breach of decorum is a reminder that in Donald Trump, we\u2019re not dealing with an ordinary candidate, but someone who threatens the very underpinnings of the American system.",

Jeffrey Toobin: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg makes clear her stance on a Trump presidency He says justices have long avoided airing political views; Ginsburg may have to recuse herself Supreme Court justices, like everyone else, become more like themselves as they get older. That\u2019s the real lesson of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s recent series of partisan observations. In a series of interviews over the past week, the 83-year-old Ginsburg let loose with several howitzers aimed at Donald Trump. Asked by a reporter from The Associated Press what would happen to the court if Trump could make nominations, she said,  \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs.\u201d In an interview with The New York Times, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be \u2013 with Donald Trump as our president,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be \u2013 I don\u2019t even want to contemplate that.\u201d She joked \u2013 it seemed like a joke, anyway \u2013 that she might move to New Zealand if Trump were to win. She expanded on this in a CNN interview: \u201cHe is a faker\u2026He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. \u2026 How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.\u201d Ginsburg\u2019s judicial politics are no secret. She became famous as the leading lawyer of the feminist movement in the 1970s; as a litigator, she won some of the biggest women\u2019s rights cases in the Supreme Court. Since her appointment to the court by Bill Clinton, in 1993, she has been its leading liberal \u2013 a fierce defender of women\u2019s rights, including abortion rights, and a supporter of affirmative action and the traditional civil rights agenda. Her integrity \u2013 like her intelligence and her energy \u2013 has been beyond reproach. But traditionally, there\u2019s been a difference between judicial politics and partisan politics, at least as far as judges are concerned. Like all the justices, Ginsburg is expected to render decisions in line with her judicial ideology, that is, her understanding of how the Constitution should be interpreted. This matter of interpretive style is as much a political judgment as a legal one. But electoral politics have long been off-limits for sitting judges, including justices. They are expected to refrain from telling us their opinions \u2013 in part because they are expected to be above such considerations but also because they rule on cases that have a strong political content. And all presidents have lots of business before the Supreme Court. Justice Kennedy opts for a liberal legacy The line between judicial politics and partisan politics can seem artificial, and Ginsburg, in her ninth decade, has decided to pretend that the line doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s a bracing honesty to this kind of candor, but it\u2019s clear she\u2019s chosen to express herself in a way that justices traditionally have not. At the practical level, Ginsburg will certainly have to recuse herself if any Bush v. Gore-style lawsuit comes before the court during this election season. She\u2019s made her views too clear about Clinton v. Trump to sit as an impartial judge. (In 2003, Justice Antonin Scalia recused himself in a case challenging the words \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge of Allegiance because he had expressed support for those words in public speeches.) Jeffrey Toobin: Sure, Merrick Garland is qualified, but this is politics More than that, though, Ginsburg\u2019s statements have set a precedent that the court as an institution will want to avoid. Imagine if all nine justices announced their presidential preferences in the advance of each election. Imagine further that they took sides in primary battles, too. It\u2019s folly to pretend that judges and justices have no political views, or that their legal views are entirely separate from their judicial philosophies. But there is value in at least formal neutrality in these most partisan battles. Any smart lawyer \u2013 or smart citizen \u2013 can see that. So, in short order, will Ginsburg.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Issac Bailey has been a journalist in South Carolina for two decades and was most recently the primary columnist for The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own. The sight of the first black president and a woman who might succeed him is cause for celebration, writes Issac Bailey By almost every important measure, America has progressed during the Obama presidency, Bailey says Hillary Clinton\u2019s appearance with President Obama in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday wasn\u2019t just the highest-profile campaign event of the general election so far \u2013 coming just hours after the FBI put a stake through the heart of the hopes of Republicans (and ardent Bernie Sanders fans) who held onto the unrealistic belief that Clinton would be indicted in \u201cEmailgate\u201d \u2013 it was the personification of the fear that is animating Donald Trump supporters more than any other. Clinton and Obama represent a new America, one in which nontraditional leaders (read: people who aren\u2019t white men) will continue emerging, taking over positions that they had long been barred from holding, either by law, social norms, or both. That\u2019s why Trump supporters aren\u2019t wrong to say they no longer recognize the country their grandparents were raised in. They view that change as a personal threat, while many of the rest of us eagerly await opportunities materializing that were denied our parents. There\u2019s a good chance the nation\u2019s first black president will be followed by its first female leader, a reality almost unimaginable a decade ago. There are two ways to digest that news: 1) Celebrate the country\u2019s constant, if at times too slow, move toward a more equitable society, even if it comes via imperfect vessels. 2) Deny the obvious by deeming the likes of Obama and Clinton natural born threats to the republic who are purposefully trying to destroy the country. Too few people have embraced the first view, too many the second. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy for so many to believe in conspiracies and take caricatures of their opponents as gospel truth. Neither Obama nor Clinton is perfect. Obama wasn\u2019t without fault before he was twice elected \u2013 or even as President \u2013 and Clinton would take her unique brand of imperfection to Washington if she wins in November. (Clinton\u2019s use of private email, while neither criminal nor unprecedented, was, frankly, dumb and, as the FBI determined, careless.) But serious shortcomings can be cited in the case of every previous occupant of the White House. Those claiming the republic is on the precipice because Clinton wasn\u2019t indicted are often the first to deify and express uncritical reverence for presidents who owned slaves, secretly sold arms to our enemies and launched wars on what turned out to be false pretenses. The republic survived each of those things but will crumble because of Clinton\u2019s email server and Obama saying that had he a son, he would look like Trayvon Martin? There are also legitimate fears motivating critics of this emerging America. White men are seeing a decrease in life expectancy as other groups continue to gain longevity compared to previous generations. Most of the jobs in the new economy are going to those with college degrees, shutting out many including white men who once were able to land family sustaining jobs without a high school diploma, or even the ability to read and write.  There\u2019s uncertainty where there once was certainty. And the results of our foreign policy decisions in the Middle East should continue to be scrutinized. But the truth is, the first black president would be handing the reins to the first female president of a nation in the midst of the longest job creation streak in its history; one which has experienced  faster economic growth than most other industrialized countries; has seen its median household income match the level reached during the 1990s;  and has the lowest teen pregnancy, abortion and uninsured rates on record. The deficit has been cut by nearly $1 trillion since 2009  while gas prices are low, the real estate market has made a comeback and the stock market has more than doubled. And today\u2019s teenagers are more educated and disciplined than previous generations, with the lowest rates of smoking, drinking and drugging on record. America\u2019s favorability around the globe, and the perception of its place as the most vital nation on Earth, have increased over the past seven years. And one of the reasons the middle class is shrinking is because more Americans are making it into the upper middle class faster than the ranks of the poor are expanding. Those are inconvenient facts for those mired in despair and disgust \u2013 much of which is built upon exaggerations, if not outright lies, about the two headliners at the Charlotte Convention Center Tuesday \u2013 that they can\u2019t allow themselves to see anything else. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion This country is moving forward in powerfully important ways, shaped by people whose ancestors were slaves or disenfranchised. There was a time that no matter our political leanings, most of us could at least acknowledge that inescapable progress. Unfortunately, that time isn\u2019t today. But Clinton and Obama in Charlotte responded to that depressing reality by doing precisely what made their accomplishments possible. They shut out the noise and giddily embraced a bright future in a country whose global approval has improved steadily since Obama took over. \u201cAmerica really is great,\u201d Obama told the crowd. It is, and getting better, no matter if some people refuse to believe it. Even with all the country\u2019s faults, it is freer today than at any other time in its history, with that freedom accessible to a greater number of people than ever. The longer those like Obama and Clinton continue shattering glass ceilings and breaking barriers, the harder it will be for cynics to deny that truth.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Cecile Richards is president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Cecile Richards: SCOTUS abortion decision a victory, but women's right to control their bodies still under threat She says the election will determine whether women continue to have a constitutional right to safe and legal abortion This week, the Supreme Court delivered an enormous victory for reproductive freedom in America. By 5-3, the Court made clear it\u2019s time for politicians to stop passing laws that harm women and limit access to safe and legal abortion, and instead respect women\u2019s right to freely make their own decisions about pregnancy. But in an election year, with Supreme Court appointments at stake, reproductive rights for far too many are still not guaranteed. Here is where we\u2019ve been: In recent years, my home state of Texas has been a battleground for reproductive rights. I was in the Texas capitol in 2013, alongside thousands of Texans, when then-state Sen. Wendy Davis spent 11 hours straight on her feet, filibustering to stop unconstitutional restrictions on abortion. The Texas legislature ultimately passed the law, known as HB2, shutting down approximately half of abortion providers statewide under the thin premise that it would make women seeking abortion safer.  In fact, HB2 was a blatant attempt to push abortion out of reach for women. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Monday, \u201cit is beyond rational belief that H. B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law \u2018would simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions.\u2019\u201d And it has. Just a few weeks ago in Fort Worth, I met a young woman from Midland, Texas. She drove 300 miles each way to access what is a legal medical procedure in the United States. She is one of many. A new era for abortion rights? Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have seen an increase in the number of patients traveling more than 100 miles for abortion, and there are many others who cannot make the trip at all. Traveling, missing work, and finding childcare are not always options. This is especially true for groups who have historically faced systemic barriers in accessing quality health care, including people with low incomes and communities of color. For 100 years, Planned Parenthood has been fighting for women\u2019s rights to control their bodies, and providing compassionate health care to help women build the future they want. But a right doesn\u2019t mean much if you cannot access it, and politicians in Texas and other states have pushed the rights of far too many out of reach. Across the country, 316 abortion restrictions have been written into law in the last five years alone, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and we can expect even more as politicians try to find new ways to punish women who seek safe and legal abortion. It\u2019s important to remember this is not just happening in Texas. Other states, including Wisconsin, Mississippi and Missouri, have passed their own laws to make it harder for doctors to provide women to access abortion. Women in this country \u2013 our daughters and sisters and neighbors \u2013 deserve better than this from their leaders. They deserve access to high-quality, compassionate care in their communities. They deserve to make their own decisions about their health, their bodies, and their future \u2013 not to have politicians make those decisions for them. Justice Kennedy opts for a liberal legacy We need to trust women. This is an election year. With at least one open seat on the Supreme Court, our next president \u2013 and the new Supreme Court justices they could appoint \u2013 will determine whether women continue to have a constitutional right to safe and legal abortion. Donald Trump has made it clear that he will eliminate women\u2019s ability to access abortion, and appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Hillary Clinton, however, has been an outspoken champion for women\u2019s health and rights. She has made it clear she understands and cares about the lives of women and families. And she will fiercely protect our ability to freely make our own decisions. That\u2019s why Planned Parenthood Action Fund is doing everything it can to elect her. For the people Planned Parenthood serves, there is too much at stake. We cannot go back to the days when abortion was a crime and doctors and women were criminals. Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision was an important step forward. Now we have to fight to protect the rights of everyone \u2013 no matter who they are or where they live \u2013 to freely make their own decisions about their health and their future.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Julian Zelizer: A month ago, it looked like the GOP was headed for convention chaos Now Democrats are enmeshed in a battle of principles that Bernie Sanders warns may be \"messy\" Donald Trump clinches nomination; Hillary Clinton's path to uniting party isn't clear, Zelizer says Just when it seemed that the election could not get any crazier, it has. A month ago, it seemed that the Democrats were sitting pretty. Republicans were in disarray. All the talk revolved around a contested convention in Cleveland as Sen. Ted Cruz kept winning delegates in state conventions who would vote for him on the second round. The #Never Trump Movement was gaining steam as prominent members of the GOP announced that they would not be able to support the New York billionaire\u2019s candidacy. In contrast, the Democrats had themselves an apparently solid nominee. After a series of strong wins, including in New York and Pennsylvania, it looked like Hillary Clinton would finally bring her competition with Bernie Sanders to an end. Clinton, it appeared, was poised to run a campaign that could replicate the events of 1964 when Lyndon Johnson trounced Barry Goldwater in a landslide victory that produced huge liberal majorities in the House and Senate.   Yet only a few weeks later, the story looks very different. Now it is the Democrats who are struggling through some fierce internecine divisions.  Sanders\u2019 attacks have intensified in recent weeks. He has raised the volume of his comments about Clinton and charged that the entire nomination process has been problematic and unfair. His supporters have flooded the airwaves to complain about the superdelegates, while Sanders announced he would support Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s primary opponent given her alleged favoritism toward Clinton. Sanders warned that the convention could be \u201cmessy,\u201d adding, \u201cDemocracy is not always nice and gentle.\u201d On the GOP side, Donald Trump has clinched the nomination by reaching the required number of 1,237 convention delegates. Republicans are uniting around him. The Never Trump Movement has vanished almost as quickly as it started. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who began with some harsh words about Trump, mellowed soon after the two had their meeting on Capitol Hill. While there are some Republicans like Mitt Romney who are still standing firm in their opposition, a significant number of prominent Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have announced their support. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was extremely harsh about Trump in recent weeks, allegedly told donors to stand behind their nominee (Graham disputed the account).   Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson penned an op-ed proclaiming that Trump was the Republican candidate and thus his man. Trump's casual racism toward Native Americans Most ominously for Democrats, a number of recent polls are showing the gap between Clinton and Trump has been shrinking, with Trump actually taking the lead in some of them. \u201cAs we near the close of the primary season, Hillary Clinton has somehow succeeded in turning the election into a close contest that she could conceivably lose,\u201d wrote Thomas Edsall in The New York Times. What\u2019s going on? How and why did the situation change so dramatically within such a short period? For Democrats, those who were hoping the tensions between Sanders and Clinton would dissipate greatly underestimated how serious the tensions are between Sanders, his supporters and the Clinton campaign. The energy that has been moving his candidacy is much more than a cult of personality or a quixotic hope for socialism in America. Sanders and many of his supporters have been motivated by a principled argument about the problems with the Democratic Party and American politics. Why I am backing Donald Trump In their minds, Hillary Clinton \u2014 and her husband \u2014 are symbols and leaders of a damaging development that has taken place since the 1970s. They argue that since Ronald Reagan was President, the Democratic Party decided to embrace the basic arguments of the conservative movement. Democrats, they say, started to champion free markets, deregulation, nonunionized workplaces and a militaristic approach to foreign policy. As Democratic candidates catered to wealthier suburban voters, they left behind working-class Americans, unions, African-Americans, the poor and other disadvantaged groups. Why California matters ... for the Dems at least Democrats, according to the Sanders campaign, have also agreed to work in a campaign finance system that ensures wealthier Americans as well as business and financial institutions will always win out in debates over public policy. Voters thus face a choice between Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Unless progressive forces fight for fundamental change, each election will involve a pragmatic decision that leaves the underlying status quo in place, they argue. The 2016 primaries are thus a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party and the future of American politics. Listen to the Trump voters The fact that Hillary Clinton has continued to lose primaries and caucuses to Sanders fuels this narrative, that somehow even the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination process is also corrupt. When you have a debate that revolves so much around fundamental principles it is difficult to persuade your opponent to gracefully concede. It is unlikely that this is going to happen.  Not only does this force Clinton to keep focusing on the primaries, rather than Trump, but the ongoing attacks on her keep hurting her standing and image in the polls. Trump said Thursday that \u201cBernie has given me some great lines\u201d to use against her. Polls are now showing that the June 7 primary in California is neck and neck, and a loss there would be a huge blow to Clinton\u2019s campaign, even if she could have enough votes to win the nomination at the convention in Philadelphia, given support from superdelegates. The State Department Inspector General\u2019s report on Clinton\u2019s email provides more fodder for Trump in his attacks on \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d with the imprimatur of a nonpartisan body. Trump and Sanders have even traded challenges to debate each other, at a time when Clinton has opted not to engage in a debate with Sanders before the California vote. In contrast, much of the Republican party\u2019s primary battle over Donald Trump was more about personality than policy. To be sure, Trump\u2019s eclectic and unorthodox agenda has caused considerable consternation among many Republicans. The fact that he rejects reform of Social Security and Medicare doesn\u2019t sit well with many fiscal hawks, including Ryan. Trump has lashed out against the free trade principles that Republican economists have been espousing. To have your front-runner support a higher minimum wage and agree that, at least sometimes, tax increases could be necessary is to utter words that are antithetical to what the party has been fighting for since Reagan. Yet much of the real concern stemmed from who he was, not what he said. The truth is that his statements have been all over the place, other than his harsh stand toward immigrants, so Republicans can find reason to believe he might not be that serious about anything. Don't let 'Never Trump' become 'Ready for Hillary' While Trump has said that some tax increases are acceptable, overall he remains an adherent of the supply side approach to the economy. Although he has argued that Planned Parenthood does good things for women, he has made some very tough statements against abortion. Trump has also been increasingly shifting to the right in recent months. As a savvy political figure, he understands that his best bet as president would be to work closely with the party that brought him to the dance. And his harshest words, about immigrants and the need to build walls to stop them, have strong support in many parts of the GOP. What has rubbed them the wrong way is who he is and what he says about the party. His crass mannerisms and harsh rhetoric don\u2019t make the party look serious.  To have a bombastic television star at the head of the party ticket can make the GOP look silly, not like the party of governance. But the reality is that the forces of partisanship are incredibly strong, particularly on the Republican side. It is difficult to dislodge voters in this day and age, as polls are showing. There are also many parts of the electorate in red states that are excited about  Trump, and legislators are seeing this reality in the polls. This, combined with the intense antipathy toward Clinton and Barack Obama, has been enough to dampen the concerns that exist about Trump as a person. With one party\u2019s civil war about personality and the other about principle, it is not that surprising that the Democrat Party fight is lasting longer than expected, and the Republicans battles are dying down. Julian Zelizer If the Republicans see a winner, many are willing to line up behind whoever can bring them the White House even if they may find Trump\u2019s personality distasteful. With one party\u2019s civil war about personality and the other about principle, it is not that surprising the Democrat Party fight is lasting longer than expected, and the Republican battles are dying down.  This should cause concern for Democrats who might be looking at two more months, at a minimum, of bitter infighting, unless Clinton can find a way to win over Sanders supporters. While the Republican convention in Cleveland, once predicted to be a disorderly free-for-all, is looking more and more like it will be a well produced, sleek, televised coronation for the would-be king.

His teams have won national championships for three years, and he\u2019s been recognized twice as the national debate coach of the year. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Debate coach: Both candidates ducked questions at debate, and Clinton interrupted too much, but overall she had very good night Graham: She challenged unprepared Sanders on issues from guns to abortion to foreign policy.  Sanders had weak debate performance For Thursday night\u2019s Democratic debate, I\u2019m focusing my debate coach evaluation squarely on improvements. Hillary Clinton:  A- She still interrupts too much.  No improvement there. She still has a terrible answer to the question of why she won\u2019t release her Wall Street speech transcripts.  But Sanders won\u2019t release all his tax returns either.  (They\u2019re both still ducking questions with answers that don\u2019t pass the smell test.) However, Clinton did have a better debate in some significant ways.  The first was in demanding Sanders produce examples of her being influenced by Wall Street, as he has so often charged.  She asked for an example, and when he couldn\u2019t come up with one, she said, \u201cThis is a phony attack designed to raise questions with no evidence or support\u2026 he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.\u201d Good response\u2026but this wasn\u2019t even her best retort of the night. In a discussion about the U.S.-backed military operation in Libya, for the first time, while admitting that the oust er of Moammar Ghadafi didn\u2019t work out as well as hoped, Clinton compared Libya to Syria. Bashar al-Assad is a terrible dictator, just like Gadhafi was, she argued.  The difference, she pointed out?  Syria is worse now, and a bigger threat to the United States than Libya is, but Syria still has Assad.  The effective takeaway? So perhaps keeping dictators in place isn\u2019t better than removing them. But neither was this her best argument of the night. The two Brooklyns await the debate We needed a major burn unit for Sanders when he chuckled during Clinton\u2019s answer on the topic of gun control.  Uh oh.  Clinton immediately turned on the senator and forcefully said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a laughing matter\u202690 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year.\u201d  I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be laughing during any more answers in the future.  Again, not even her best line. Clinton consistently reminded the audience that she had plans to fix the country\u2019s problems, while \u2013 as she pointed out \u2013 Sanders did little more than \u201cdiagnose.\u201d  Several times during the debate, Clinton mentioned that \u201cit\u2019s easy to diagnose the problem \u2026 and again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we\u2019ve got to do much more to finish the work..,\u201d but she added \u201cit\u2019s harder to do something about the problem.\u201d  Again, this was new and effective. But it was one hour and forty-nine minutes into the debate before Clinton delivered her best moment \u2013 it was on the Supreme Court.  Right after Sanders answered that he\u2019d want to make sure the new justice would help overturn Citizens United, Clinton received a resounding ovation when she said that they\u2019d had nine debates now, and nobody had questioned them about Roe v. Wade. Clinton reminded the audience that Sanders characterized Donald Trump\u2019s statement on women needing to be punished if they obtained an abortion a \u201cdistraction.\u201d  She emphatically said that Trump\u2019s statement \u201cgoes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions.\u201d Very strong moment in a very focused debate performance for Clinton. Bernie Sanders:  D First, he had nothing new. By this point in the debate cycle, Sanders should have been ready with specifics on how he\u2019d pay for his proposals without raising the debt, hurting businesses or crushing the middle class. But he was not prepared with this. He couldn\u2019t specify how he\u2019d break up the banks, which he said he\u2019d let them do themselves somehow. Sanders demonstrated an inability to understand either the premise of questions or that he was contradicting himself, which is not a sharp debating stance. To show his gun-control bona fides, Sanders repeated his oft-told story about how the NRA caused him to lose an election in 1988 by opposing him.   But Clinton was ready for this, and for the first time in a debate, smartly produced an account of what happened after 1988.  Sanders won every election, she said.  Why?  He made promises (or softened his stance to) the NRA. She even noted that in his own book Sanders claims he won in 1990 because the NRA opposed his rival.  Indeed, as she pointed out, he voted against the Brady Bill five times. Who won Democrats' epic debate in Brooklyn? So if you\u2019re keeping score at home, while Sanders could not provide a single piece of legislation that Clinton supported (or blocked) that offered proof of her being influenced by Wall Street, she slammed home an example of Sanders being influenced \u2013 and changing his voting because of influence \u2013 by the NRA.  She noted that he\u2019s been a reliable supporter ever since that first election loss. The second example of Sanders not comprehending what was happening in the debate came when he literally contradicted himself on the issue of climate change. He criticized Clinton\u2019s pragmatic approach to energy policy and in particular fracking, by stating, \u201cIncrementalism and those little steps is not enough.  Not right now and not on climate change.\u201d Unfortunately, Sanders answered the opposite way on a pointed question about the difficulty of transitioning to green, or sustainable, energy.   Sanders replied that we will \u201cnot phase out tomorrow\u2026\u201d implying that we should, you know, take our time.  Within seconds Sanders was both against, and then for baby-steps. Unbelievably bad debating by Sanders.   But much better debating for Clinton. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Will Bunch is senior writer for the Philadelphia Daily News and author of \u201cTear Down This Myth: The Right-Wing Distortion of the Reagan Legacy\u201d and the recent e-book, \u201cThe Bern Identity: A Search for Bernie Sanders and the New American Dream.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Will Bunch says pundits trashed Reagan's '76 campaign, but it was the beginning of GOP's transformation; Bunch: Even if he loses the nomination, Sanders may do the same for the Democrats, shaping the party's message for 2020 After losing an embarrassing six straight primaries, including the critical states of Florida and Illinois, the upstart presidential candidate came under tremendous pressure from the party establishment to get out of the race.  Party insiders called his proposals \u201csimplistic,\u201d pundits fretted he was too old and even a key aide admitted one goal was to show \u201cwe were not the candidate of kooks.\u201d But the challenger insisted that he\u2019d tapped into real anger among the ignored rank-and-file voters who wanted him to fight all the way to the party convention in July. \u201cThe issue I sense,\u201d he told an interviewer, \u201cis that the Empire is in decline. The establishment doesn\u2019t want to raise it.\u201d He used new technologies to reach small-dollar donors, and his allies noted that he\u2019d \u201csharpened\u201d his rival\u2019s message for a general election. And so, in the spring of 1976, Ronald Reagan pressed on with his underdog quest to wrest the GOP nomination from the incumbent (albeit unelected) President Gerald Ford \u2013 following a track that should look very familiar to the voters and pundits watching the out-of-left-field 2016 Democratic primary challenge by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Who's really qualified to be President? 11 takes Reagan found a narrow issue to focus voters\u2019 rage (a plan to return the Panama Canal to Panama) and a state that bought into his message, North Carolina \u2013 just as Sanders used unease over trade deals to upset the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, in Michigan last month. Over the second half of the 1976 primary season, the former movie actor won a string of victories and narrowed the delegate gap with Ford \u2013 much as Sanders just did with a winning streak in late March. And, just as the Vermont ultraliberal independent is doing today, Reagan schemed to win uncommitted delegates and pry loose pledged ones, creating real suspense at the convention in Kansas City. Yet, for Reagan, it wasn\u2019t enough to overcome Ford\u2019s early wins or the advantages of incumbency. But with the benefit of hindsight, it\u2019s clear that his narrow loss at the 1976 convention wasn\u2019t so much a defeat as the greatest leap forward in the long march of modern American conservatism. Is Bernie Sanders taking the low road? By pressing his challenge to the very end, \u201cthe Gipper\u201d set the stage not just for his own presidency four years later but for a new, right-leaning GOP orthodoxy on the size of government tax policy, and social issues such as women\u2019s rights and abortion. Exactly four decades later, Sanders \u2013 the avatar of so-called \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d that would swing the national pendulum to the far left \u2013 stands on the precipice of remaking the Democratic Party every bit as much as Reagan did on the far opposite side of the ideological spectrum. Indeed, the spirit of \u201976 \u2013 1976, that is \u2013 looms large behind Sanders\u2019 determination to keep fighting Clinton all the way to Democratic confab in Philadelphia. Hillary, don't go negative on Bernie The decisions the Vermonter and his allies will make over the next three months \u2013 in pushing for a more liberal party plank, in how Sanders addresses the convention delegates \u2013 may determine whether the Sanders insurgency  becomes the wild-haired face of American politics for years to come, perhaps long after Sanders himself has left the stage. Sanders\u2019 supporters would surely find solace in the way that Reagan \u2013 whose two-term presidency is today enshrined on the nameplates for airports, schools and boulevards \u2013 was dismissed in the run-up to 1976, his first full-fledged presidential primary campaign. Conservative thought-leader George Will wrote in 1974 that Reagan looked \u201ctoo old\u201d to be taken seriously, that he had \u201cnever demonstrated national appeal\u201d and that his hardcore supporters were \u201ckamikaze\u201d ideologues. But then, as in 2016, the punditocracy was fighting the last war. Will and other Beltway insiders still looked to Sen. Barry Goldwater\u2019s landslide loss in 1964 \u2013 backed by Reagan in his televised speech \u201cA Time for Choosing\u201d \u2013 as proof that an unvarnished conservative could never win a national election. But out on the campaign trail, a growing strain of the electorate \u2013 battered by Vietnam, Watergate and the social upheavals of the 1960s \u2013 was more receptive to Reagan\u2019s unyielding message of national restoration than it had been 12 years earlier. The allegations of a Panama Canal \u201cgiveaway\u201d struck the right note with these voters. George Will wrote in 1974 that Reagan looked \u201ctoo old\u201d to be taken seriously, that he had \u201cnever demonstrated national appeal\u201d and that his hardcore supporters were \u201ckamikaze\u201d ideologues. Will Bunch Get ready for real show in New York \u201cI think we\u2019d be damn fools if we turned over the Panama Canal,\u201d Reagan said on the eve of his upset in North Carolina. \u201cWe built it. We paid for it. It\u2019s ours.\u201d As Reagan went on to rack up huge wins in states such as Texas, the centrist Ford shifted to the right on issues such as restoring the death penalty, while jettisoning his liberal vice president, Nelson Rockefeller. Yet Reagan was able to fight on, in part because of revolutionary fundraising tactics \u2013 especially advances in direct mail that allowed him to pinpoint his money appeals to true conservatives from coast-to-coast. The payoff in Kansas City proved not to be Reagan\u2019s nomination but winning in platform fights over a \u201cmoral foreign policy\u201d \u2013 seen as a rebuff to Ford\u2019s d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union \u2013 and opposing abortion rights. When Reagan told the wildly cheering delegates that 100 years hence \u201c[w]hether [people] have the freedoms that we have known up until now will depend on what we do here,\u201d  it had already become his Republican Party. Although The New York Times reported as settled truth that the then-65-year-old Reagan would be \u201ctoo old\u201d to run in 1980, it was the vigor of his to-the-last-drop 1976 campaign that propelled him into the White House. The similarities to what Democratic challenger Sanders has accomplished so far in 2016 are striking. Just like Reagan, the Brooklyn native was dismissed at the outset as a \u201cprotest candidate\u201d who couldn\u2019t win by TV talking heads who didn\u2019t understand how 40 years of growing income inequality had primed the Democratic base for a candidate who embraces a form of socialism. Then, his surprising strength caused the arguably centrist Clinton to move left, both in her rhetoric and on key issues such as blocking the Keystone XL pipeline or a Pacific trade deal. In the meantime, Sanders\u2019 preference for mass rallies over staged photo-ops (a Reagan innovation) and his ability to tap into 2 million-plus small donors has overturned all conventional wisdom on how to seek the Oval Office. With roughly three months until the Philadelphia convention, the voices among the Democratic elite clamoring for Sanders to leave the race or \u201ctone down\u201d his message are arguably acting with self-interested ignorance of history \u2013 of how Reagan\u2019s mirror-image challenge reinvented the Republican Party to dominate American politics in the latter 20th century. Still, a Sanders rejuvenation of the Democrats will require hard work in the weeks and months ahead \u2013 successfully inserting key progressive planks such as free public college tuition or a $15 living wage in the platform, and recruiting a new generation of like-minded activists to run for other offices in 2018, 2020 and beyond. And what of the 2020 presidential race? The world has changed a lot in four decades. It would be the height of presumption to write off the now 74-year-old Sanders as \u201ctoo old.\u201d Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine.",

Every comment a president makes can send armies marching and markets tumbling. Voters intuitively get this. They watch. They see how the candidates make split-second decisions under the klieg lights and measure how these men and women might deal with the relentless pressures of the presidency. Issues are important. But command and sure-footedness in critical moments are essential. David Axelrod Issues are important. But command and sure-footedness in critical moments are essential. Which brings us to Donald Trump\u2019s horrendous week. Let me first stipulate that Trump has made a monkey of me and many other expert bloviators who predicted his candidacy\u2019s early demise. The slow-motion implosion of the Republican Party Regardless of the plausibility or tastefulness of some of his comments and ideas \u2013 no, Mexico is not paying for The Wall and America is not going to betray its values by barring a quarter of the world\u2019s population from our shores \u2013 Trump has brilliantly tapped into a wellspring of anger and resentment that is real and powerful. What does Trump really think? His primal screams about immigrants, Muslims, China, \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and the corrupt bargain between special interests and Washington have found an enthusiastic audience among white working-class Americans who feel squeezed by changes in the economy and the country and disdained by elites from the Acela Corridor to Hollywood. They have rallied to the Strong Man, who scoffs at constitutional niceties and international norms and promises to Make America Great Again. For these voters, tired of nuance and complexity, Trump is the anti-Obama ideal \u2013 a guy for whom every problem, from terrorism to stagnant wages, is a nail just waiting to be walloped by a leader who has the strength and guts to pick up the hammer. For months, Trump was buoyed and intoxicated by the allegiance of this faithful throng, whose support was enough to assure him a string of victories in a large and divided primary field. \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters,\u201d he chortled in a strange and revealing moment. Donald Trump auditioning for the biggest role of his life He was helped in his improbable march by the timidity of his opponents and the Republican establishment, who until recently were reluctant to tangle with the tart-tongued Trump, hoping he would simply fade away; and by the insatiable appetite of TV news executives, who quickly realized the outrageous former reality show star was an unexpected ratings bonanza. In the seeming blink of an eye, Trump was transformed from an insult-slinging sideshow to front-runner who, as of today, is the only candidate who could plausibly capture enough delegates to claim a first-ballot victory when Republicans gather in Cleveland this summer. Now holy hell is raining down upon him. How Donald Trump sees himself That is the nature of the presidential gauntlet. The better you do, the longer you go, the greater the scrutiny. The media analyzes and parses every word with a greater seriousness and intensity when spoken by a likely nominee for president of the United States. For months, Trump had treated the campaign as his own personal open mic night, commanding the stage with his audacious improvisation. This past week, the process caught up with him. His blithe assertion that he would encourage Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear arms; his defense of his campaign manager\u2019s alleged strong-arming of a female reporter; and his suggestion, quickly recanted, that women who have abortions should be punished, created a sense of chaos around the candidate. He continued to stumble over the abortion issue all week. Could we trust Trump with U.S. foreign policy? Many analysts suggested that the abortion issue could be the death knell for Trump, who with one ill-considered line touched off a firestorm on both sides of the explosive debate. Trump already had catastrophic problems with women. The latest CNN poll showed that 73% of women voters \u2013 including nearly 40% of Republican women \u2013 held an unfavorable view of Trump before the abortion tsunami hit. And pro-life Republicans, suspicious of Trump as a late convert to the cause, saw Trump\u2019s lurching back and forth on the issue as yet another sign of his ideological promiscuousness. But the real damage is more profound. Dear women who love Trump: Ditch this guy In the last week, under a front-runner\u2019s scrutiny and pressure, Trump looked like a guy who simply can\u2019t hack it. This is unlikely to shake off the Trump zealots, that 35% of the Republican primary base who seem unshakably committed. But it could cost him the ability to grow, putting Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich in a position to deny Trump the more than 50% of remaining pledged delegates he needs to clinch the party\u2019s nod. Even if Trump were to grind out the nomination, which he still may, given his lead, he would enter the general election with significantly lower public approval ratings than any major party nominee in U.S. history, relieving likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton of that dubious distinction. This week, the MRI of Trump\u2019s soul, and of his preparedness to serve as president and commander in chief, began to come into sharper focus. And while his loyal base may have been unbothered, much of the rest of America was alarmed at what it showed. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Donald Trump sparked controversy with remarks this week on abortions Peggy Drexler: This time, it's possible even Trump has gone too far But to call him sexist? That one\u2019s on us, not him. That\u2019s the question coming on the heels of the latest remarks from the campaign season\u2019s most provocative candidate. Earlier this week, you\u2019ve probably heard, Trump announced that if abortion were banned \u2013 which it very well could be if he is elected to office \u2013 he believed women who undergo the procedure should be punished. And yet, it\u2019s more than just a case of another day, another headline-making proclamation. This time, it\u2019s possible even Trump has gone too far \u2013 and not just with female voters, but with all voters. In an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews, the GOP front-runner couldn\u2019t say what exactly the punishment would be, just that if women\u2019s right to choose is revoked, it could force many to seek out illegal procedures, and that those who do should face repercussions. The men responsible for impregnating the women, though \u2013 they\u2019d have nothing to worry about. It was a conservative line of thinking even for Trump. Even the most mainstream anti-abortion views \u2013 espoused by such conservatives as Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee \u2013 tend to advocate for punishment for providers, rather than for women. Certainly, Trump has found success in riling people up. Every week seems to bring a new op-ed calling him out on some offense or another. And yet he\u2019s still talking. That\u2019s because people are listening, women included, despite the fact that many of his policies would seem to alienate them. Indeed, voters have so far handed him victories in 18 states. And just this week, when asked whether she would vote for Hillary Clinton if Bernie Sanders were to lose the nomination, actress and activist Susan Sarandon told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to see what happens.\u201d This certainly wasn\u2019t an endorsement for Trump, but neither was it censure. And yet this week\u2019s events have many asking whether Trump\u2019s latest incitements might serve, at last, as a wake-up call for those who continue to offer him support. Dear women who love Trump Perhaps they should. At the very least, they might highlight just how negatively impactful his election to office could be. And not just for women, but for all voters. For one thing, consider that in the conversation with Matthews, Trump showed, as he has in the past, that his politics are often less about beliefs and policies than extremism, provocation and control; being the loudest in the room and having the final say. Trump speaks and acts before he thinks \u2013 as a politician, at least. This was underscored by the fact that he has already backtracked from his abortion statements. After the media outcry, Trump\u2019s campaign released a clarification, saying that, \u201cThis issue is unclear and should be put back into the states for determination. Like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions, which I have outlined numerous times.\u201d A second clarification said that he believed \u201cthe doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman.\u201d Which begs the question that should be top of everyone\u2019s mind, including his own: What does Trump really think, anyway? What\u2019s real and what\u2019s bluster? Has he gotten too caught up in his own rhetoric to know? For one thing, he hasn\u2019t always been so staunchly anti-abortion. In a 1999 interview he declared himself \u201cvery pro-choice.\u201d He has both defended Planned Parenthood and suggested the government should shut down to avoid funding it. On the topic of working women, he\u2019s been both an advocate and an adversary. This may be the most concerning thing, for women and men, about the notion of Trump as president: He\u2019s equivocal about things that really matter. Trump\u2019s smart. So it\u2019s baffling that he seems to be working so hard to alienate women and, along with them, the men who recognize women as equal members of society. Yet as Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the highest-ranking GOP woman in Congress as House Conference chair, told The New York Times: \u201cI think his comments regarding women and other comments, I find them inappropriate. I find them hurtful and I think they are hurtful to the party, a party that has been founded on equal opportunity for all.\u201d Polls already show that women are starting to disapprove. It looks like some of those in his own party may be at the top of the list. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael Broyde is a law professor at Emory University. He is not related to, nor has he ever met Judge Richard A. Posner. Like many, he has admired Posner from afar. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Michael Broyde: Court picks when other party controls Senate are moderate or unpredictable He says Obama could nominate a moderate, do a recess appointment or tap top legal mind He says Judge Richard Posner is such a candidate, the leading intellectual light in law The Constitution is clear: The President nominates a successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and the Senate\u2019s consent is needed for confirmation to the Supreme Court. More than that seems to be at stake in the current political climate, however, and the contest is one of political will, rather than law. The President may nominate any candidate he wishes, and the Senate may reject any candidate. Neither the President nor the Senate is required to give any reason for their decisions. Presidents have in the past nominated candidates widely considered mediocre or brilliant, and the Senate has rejected both mediocre and brilliant nominees. But the recent data seem to point to a trend. Nominees to the Supreme Court made by a President when the other party controls the Senate are unpredictable and moderate. Consider a few justices in recent memory who were nominated by a Republican President and confirmed by a Democratic Senate: President Ronald Reagan appointed Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is now the court\u2019s centrist (and voted in support of same-sex marriage last term); President George H.W. Bush appointed Justice David Souter, who became comfortably liberal; President Richard Nixon appointed Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote the opinion in Roe v. Wade, the seminal abortion case. 'Dead Man Walking' nun: My argument with Scalia Justice William Brennan, whom President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated, became a leading liberal light. Other examples could be found to suggest that justices nominated by a President and confirmed by a Senate controlled by the other party are more likely to be moderate or unpredictable. Focusing on election-year appointments might be a red herring. Given that reality, three confirmable nominees are possible in the current situation. First, the President can nominate a moderate or one whose track record makes labeling her or him difficult. There are many advantages to moderate appointments, but they require compromise between the parties, which is in short supply now. The disadvantages of this approach are also clear: Justices appointed in this model rarely turn out as predicted, and the President may not want to appoint someone he will regret. (Eisenhower once referred to Brennan\u2019s selection as a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d) Justice Scalia's unexamined death points to a problem Second, the President can appoint someone to the court through a recess selection (when the Senate is adjourned). This temporary appointment would last until a justice is confirmed or until December 2017. A few Supreme Court justices have been appointed through recess appointments, and Eisenhower appointed three such justices. The advantages to such an appointment are two-fold. The President can appoint whomever he wishes, and the court will have its full complement of nine members. The disadvantages are also clear. Interim appointments weaken the Supreme Court\u2019s perceived integrity since such justices lack life tenure. I want to suggest a third option: The President should appoint a leading legal mind at the end of his career.  In particular, the President should nominate Judge Richard Posner to the Supreme Court. Posner is a leading intellectual light of the past half-century in law. He is the author of more than 40 books \u2013 many of them landmarks and classics in diverse fields. He has been a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 1981. The Journal of Legal Studies found Posner to be the most-cited legal scholar of all time by a considerable margin. He is respected by judges, law professors and lawyers alike. He is the modern \u201cAlbert Einstein\u201d of American law, and it has always been an embarrassment to the legal system that he is not a member of the Supreme Court.  Imagine the NBA Hall of Fame without Michael Jordan: Richard Posner is the Michael Jordan of Law. The Scalia vacancy Three additional factors are important in supporting Posner\u2019s selection. The judge is not a moderate but an iconoclast, with unique positions that neither political party fully supports: He supports same-sex marriage, is a conservative on economic matters, opposes the war on drugs, minimizes privacy and is famous for undertaking economic analysis of many issues. Everybody agrees with him sometimes and almost no one all the time. Second, Posner is already 77 and is unlikely to serve for many decades given his age. The next President could conceivably name Posner\u2019s successor. Finally, and most importantly, the idea that one of the leading lights of law worldwide is a Supreme Court justice ought to make anyone who cares about the high court and the law proud to be an American.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David M. Perry is an associate professor of history at Dominican University in Illinois. He writes regularly at his blog: How Did We Get Into This Mess? Follow him on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. David Perry: Only Hillary Clinton has set forth a detailed plan so far; advocates are watching to see who else does He says the view of autism has changed dramatically since 2008 On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton released the most detailed policy document on autism in U.S. presidential election history. While other candidates have spoken about autism from time to time, both in this election cycle and in previous years, we\u2019ve never seen anything so informed and friendly to the autistic community. Her \u201cPlan to Support Children, Youth, and Adults Living with Autism and their Families\u201d is notable for its focus on adults and for the complete absence of stigmatizing words such as \u201ccure\u201d or \u201cepidemic.\u201d The rhetoric is good, the policy is better, and the problems with the document (and there are some) are relatively few. As Sara Luterman, editor of NOS Magazine and an autistic activist told me, \u201cIf even half of the things on Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan happen, I\u2019d be extremely pleased.\u201d The best of Clinton\u2019s ideas would lead to tangible improvements in job opportunities, education and the inclusion of neurodiverse people living in a society that too often discriminates against them. Moreover, the politics of this announcement ought to serve Clinton well. Millions of autistic people and their caregivers, not to mention allies in other branches of the disability community, are witnessing a sustained, thoughtful commitment to their rights, services and supports. That\u2019s almost never happened before. Which begs the question: Where are the other candidates on these issues? So far, commitment to disability issues of any kind has been mostly an afterthought for the other major candidates. Clinton developed her plan in consultation with major autistic rights groups. I spoke to Ari Ne\u2019eman, president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and C.J. Volpe, chief of media strategy for Autism Speaks. Both organizations, among others, were consulted by the campaign. These organizations often disagree, but both were relatively pleased with the plan. That\u2019s impressive, as it\u2019s a tricky needle to thread. Moreover, the organizations stand ready to consult with any other candidate needing advice on these issues. How a model with Down syndrome made it to the catwalk The research that went into the plan shows in its sophisticated language. As Dr. Emily Willingham writes at Forbes, even a few years ago such a plan would have been packed with \u201ccure\u201d language, calling autism an epidemic, and focusing only on children and their parents. Although the document released in 2008 by then-candidate Barack Obama\u2019s disability policy committee, the only committee of its sort in presidential history, is excellent overall, its autism language reflects the norms at the time.  It focuses on causes and treatments, not supports.  When Clinton spoke about autism in \u201908, Willingham notes, she talked about epidemics and cures. Clinton has come a long way. She\u2019s listening to the community. Thanks to the power of the neurodiversity movement and self-advocates (disabled people speaking on their own behalf) forcing their way into the public attention, we think about autism and related conditions very differently than the candidates did in \u201908. The social model of disability teaches us that the challenges faced by autistic people do not emerge from flaws in the autistic person themselves, but from a society that is ill-equipped to provide the supports that autistic people need. The best parts of Clinton\u2019s plan addresses such needs, focusing on jobs, education and expanding health care access. Clinton\u2019s plan also emphasizes adults. We still have no idea how many adults have autism, whether undiagnosed or, even worse, misdiagnosed and poorly treated. Why handcuffing children is a really bad idea This \u201cmissing generation,\u201d as Jessica Wright called it, not only struggles without the supports they need, but the undercounting lends credence to the fearmongering about an epidemic of autism today. Yes, rates are higher now, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re better at counting. Clinton\u2019s plan seems to get that distinction. To be sure, the plan is not perfect. Amy Sequenzia, an autistic activist, raised concerns about Clinton\u2019s support for the genomic research program into the genetic makeup of autism, known unfortunately as MSSNG. First of all, she and many others have said, autistic people are not \u201cmissing.\u201d Secondly, she wrote, \u201cMSSNG, and any type of research under the guise of \u201cmapping\u201d the genetics of autism, is that the likely outcome is to prevent births of autistic people \u2013 as in selective abortion. Autism is not a disease, a brain cannot be prevented, and the research money could be better used to find better ways for all neurodivergent people to participate in all things.\u201d Sequenzia\u2019s concerns are widely shared among autistic activists and their allies. Even those who would be interested in the research just to know are concerned about the eugenic purposes to which such knowledge might be put. Sequenzia is also concerned about the phrase \u201cbehavioral supports\u201d as indicating a plan to increase financial backing for Applied Behavior Analysis therapy (ABA), which many autistics consider abusive and unhelpful. Julia Bascom, deputy executive director of ASAN, is less worried about ABA. She actually sees the plan\u2019s emphasis on diverse autism services as pushing the boundaries of what insurance companies cover. She told me, \u201cThe language she uses is specifically language we are starting to see used to advocate for a variety of options beyond ABA to be offered.\u201d Bascom said that Clinton\u2019s plan would better fund services such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy and developmental therapies such as \u201cfloor time.\u201d \u201cIt definitely includes ABA,\u201d Bascom said, \u201cBut, unlike the way most autism insurance mandates are interpreted now, (Clinton\u2019s plan) covers other things as well.\u201d From the archives: What it feels like to be autistic These are details that, if Clinton is elected, need to be discussed before any policy changes go into effect. But what if Clinton isn\u2019t elected? What do other candidates think about these issues?  For the most part, we just don\u2019t know. I know many disabled Republicans, including plenty of autistic people. None of them plans to vote for Hillary Clinton. But they are going to vote, and the Republican candidate who takes a stand on their issues is likely to get their attention. So far, the most prominent statement they\u2019ve heard on autism from a GOP candidate was when Donald Trump propagated the fraudulent link between vaccines and the condition. That said, the Clinton plan may be a sign that disability is finally emerging as an important campaign topic. In July, RespectAbility, a nonprofit focused on empowering people with disabilities, launched a regular column on disability and the campaign, lamenting the relative lack of discussion of these issues. Gupta fact-checks vaccine comments by Trump, Carson Last week, Lauren Appelbaum, RespectAbility\u2019s communications director, wrote, \u201cWhat is most remarkable is that Clinton is just one of numerous presidential candidates to be discussing disability issues. In comparison, during the 2012 cycle, the word \u201cdisability\u201d was very rarely even uttered. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has been talking about autism since his announcement video. Ohio Gov. John Kasich often gets emotional when talking about the subject.\u201d She\u2019s right about the emotion, but I want see more documents like Clinton\u2019s plan. Heartwarming stories and general statements of support for the rights of disabled people to have jobs, for example, are nice. Policy is what changes the realities. Obama had a disability policy advisory committee in 2008. No candidate, to my knowledge, including Clinton, has a similar group in 2016. There are around 57 million Americans with disabilities. There are tens of millions of people like me, who are not disabled but are directly connected to disability in some way. My 9-year-old son has Down syndrome. Research shows that disability issues strongly inform our voting decisions. Clinton has now made a major play for our votes. Whether you like the details of Clinton\u2019s plan or not, she has now set a new floor for what a presidential candidate can be expected to do. The others need to step up. If, that is, they want to win. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Tim Stanley: In his campaign against Hillary Clinton, Trump has brought up Bill Clinton's infidelity. It may be unkind, but it's fair He says Democrats show double standard on sexism. Bill Clinton may become a bigger electoral factor than they think Like a broken clock, Donald Trump is occasionally right. Who knew it would be about the subject of gender politics? Trump looks and sounds like a cave man in a business suit. But he\u2019s helped illustrate a Democratic double-standard on sexism. This latest row started when Trump said Hillary Clinton had been \u201cschlonged\u201d by Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 schlong is a Yiddish word meaning penis. Clinton replied using a French word, saying that Trump had a \u201cpenchant for sexism.\u201d Trump then charged the Clintons with sexism in a back and forth that culminated with his assertion to CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that Bill is \u201cone of the great woman abusers.\u201d Pundits of left and right were suddenly divided. Was Trump articulating conservative bigotry towards successful women? Or is Bill Clinton fair game? Sanders not dwelling on 'Bill Clinton's sex life,' but Trump won't let go He is and he isn\u2019t. On the one hand, Hillary Clinton deserves to be able to pursue the White House in her own right. True, she is who is she is because of her husband \u2013 their marriage leant her stature. But Bill is also who he is because of Hillary \u2013 he would never have made it to the presidency without her political genius. Since then, Mrs. Clinton has served as a senator and secretary of state. There is something unkind about making her relive decades-old humiliations forced on her by spousal infidelity. On the other hand, if the DNC insists on stitching the Democratic nomination up for Hillary Clinton, this sort of thing is bound to happen. The price of living in the past is that you have to live with your mistakes. Memories of the Clinton administration do recall sound economic management. But they also recall infidelity and, as a result, a much-reduced presidency. It\u2019s often forgotten that one reason George W. Bush beat Al Gore in 2000, despite the country\u2019s prosperity, was that people were tired of an administration that had about as much class as one of those paternity test episodes of Maury Povich. Just as Jeb Bush was asked questions about his brother\u2019s record in office, it\u2019s sadly predictable that Hillary will be asked about her husband\u2019s sexual shenanigans in the Oval Office. Donald Trump doesn't understand what 'sexism' is It\u2019s a subject that Democrats seem strangely reluctant to acknowledge. Shamefully so. Republican hypocrisy on sex tends to involve self-professed Christians being caught fooling around with the parishioners. Democrats\u2019 hypocrisy on sex means proclaiming feminism only to then display a porcine attitude towards women. Bill Clinton settled a long-running sexual harassment case with Paula Jones for $850,000, admitted to a sexual relationship with Gennifer Flowers and had an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. Some other women have accused the former president of harassment, which is denied by the Clintons but doubly embarrassing in light of Hillary\u2019s recent insistence that victims of sexual assault \u201chave the right to be believed.\u201d Because Bill Clinton used his presidential authority to defend abortion rights, accusations made against him were ignored or dismissed by supporters. The feminist writer Anne Roiphe said at the time: \u201cIt will be a great pity if the Democratic Party is damaged by this. \u2026 I just wanted to close my eyes, and wished it would go away.\u201d Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, said: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to think of the bigger picture, think about what\u2019s best for women.\u201d This is classic left-wing instrumentalism \u2013 being coldly, even ruthlessly pragmatic in pursuit of idealistic ends, ignoring the effects upon the individuals involved. It\u2019s an attitude at variance with contemporary morals. Old school feminists often had to suffer the indignities of working alongside chauvinist pigs to get things done. Not so anymore. Increasingly, feminism is judged as much on how we treat each other on a day-to-day basis as it is on government policy \u2013 so there is no hiding place for the politician who says one thing and then does another. That makes perfect sense. We\u2019d have no tolerance for someone who preached civil rights from the pulpit but was condescending to black people in private. Likewise, many modern feminists would be astonished at the idea that a woman should have to \u201ctolerate\u201d her partner\u2019s bad behavior as part of a political contract. In 1992, during the Gennifer Flowers frenzy, Hillary Clinton joked that she wasn\u2019t \u201csome little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.\u201d Three decades later, that\u2019s exactly what she does look like to many people. How will this affect the presidential race? Trump\u2019s remarks certainly won\u2019t do him any damage in the primaries. Contrary to liberal myth, there are such things as Republican women and they tend to be just as conservative as Republican men. In the general election, however, many more moderate women may find it unappealing that The Donald chooses to personalize politics by going after Bill Clinton and see his remarks as underscoring conservative hostility towards feminists trying to break the glass ceiling. But don\u2019t be too surprised if Bill Clinton becomes a bigger electoral issue than once expected. We live in an era haunted by ghosts of old scandals: Historic abuse cases are bringing down powerful men all the time. There is an appetite for correcting the sins of the past. Bill Clinton may find himself being horribly reminded of his ill-spent youth. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Gay, lesbian and transgender people fear diminished civil rights under President-elect Donald Trump While Trump has been called \"LGBT-friendly,\" critics say the party platform is anything but The election of Donald Trump and running mate Mike Pence set off panic in gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender communities across the country, as people worried which of their divisive campaign promises would come true. Would the President-elect make good on his pledge to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which protects transgender people from discrimination in accessing health care? Will he appoint conservative judges to the US Supreme Court who could roll back marriage equality and other civil rights? Will Pence\u2019s long-ago support for so-called \u201cconversion therapy\u201d translate to a directive for LGBT youth? Questions such as these flooded the offices of LGBT advocacy groups nationwide following Trump\u2019s victory early Wednesday. Despite being regarded by some as one of the most \u201cpro-LGBT\u201d Republican presidential nominees ever, who expressed sympathy for the LGBT community after the Orlando nightclub shooting, critics say his conservative advisers \u2013 Pence included \u2013 and the Republican party\u2019s anti-LGBT platform are a threat to the progress made during the Obama administration\u2019s  legacy. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from really, really scared people,\u201d said Rachel Tiven, CEO of Lambda Legal, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a fear of an atmosphere of intolerance that began with Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201d Spokespeople for Trump and Pence did not return requests for comment. The Human Rights Campaign, which supported Hillary Clinton, held a Facebook Live broadcast on Thursday to address some of the concerns. Here\u2019s what their experts and others from national LGBT groups had to say. Many same-sex couples worry that their marriages could be invalidated in Trump\u2019s America, or that if things are getting serious they better hurry up and make it official before their right to tie the knot disappears. Neither the President nor Congress can take away what the Supreme Court has deemed a \u201cfundamental right,\u201d leaving current marriages safe, multiple legal experts said. While Trump does not have the right to unilaterally scrap marriage equality, he has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices who could. So far, judicial conservatives are said to be very pleased with his potential nominees. But it would take a long time for the court to repeal marriage equality \u2013 if they decide to, Tiven said. Regardless of who replaces Justice Antonin Scalia, the five Supreme Court justices who ushered in marriage equality will remain. The jurists that replace them could be the ones that bring change. By then, though, advocates are optimistic that society will have adjusted to the idea and let it be. \u201cPeople\u2019s hearts and minds have changed,\u201d HRC legal director Sarah Warbelow said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had rights rolled back but it is rare.\u201d Gay and lesbian parents are worried that their parental rights could be in jeopardy, especially for the non-biological parent. Even if that person\u2019s name is on the child\u2019s birth certificate, experts say it\u2019s best to adopt the child. Also called a second parent adoption, it\u2019s a court order that says as a legal matter the adult is a parent, said Jennifer C. Pizer, senior counsel and law and policy director of Lambda Legal. Though the states set adoption and parental rights policies, adoption ensures both parents have a legal tie, which could help in challenges to parental rights at the federal level. \u201cCourt judgments are recognized from state to state as a constitutional rule so even if federal law changes you\u2019re a parent of the child,\u201d she said. North Carolina\u2019s controversial HB 2 got most of the attention, but 2016 brought similar proposals to regulate bathroom access for transgender people across the country. Advocacy groups fully expected the ball to keep rolling regardless of who captured the presidency. LGBT rights: The national battle of the bathroom \u201cIt was clear in 2016 that we saw an upswing in anti-trans legislation, more than we\u2019d ever seen before,\u201d said Transgender Law Center Executive Director Kris Hayashi. \u201cWe anticipated that was not going to lessen but increase in 2017.\u201d In response, advocacy groups have been training across the country for more legislative battles, he said. \u201cWhat is needed in this moment is for transgender leaders to continue the work we\u2019ve been doing advocating and organizing for our rights.\u201d The Obama administration\u2019s recommendation to schools to treat transgender students in accordance with their gender identity drew cheers from advocacy groups and criticism from conservatives, including Pence. Trump said transgender people should be protected under the law but rejected the use of federal law to do so, saying it should be left to the states. Even if Trump rescinds the Obama administration\u2019s guidance, the laws upon which it was based won\u2019t change, said David Stacy, Government Affairs Director of HRC. The directive is largely based on Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, which forbids discrimination based on gender. In recent years, trial court and court of appeals decisions have interpreted Title IX to cover sexual orientation and gender identity, too, extending its protections to the LGBT population. \u201cSchools have an obligation to follow the law whether the guidance is repealed or not,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to recognizing a name change, or the use of bathroom facilities, under federal law schools have a legal and moral obligation to treat all students with dignity and respect.\u201d Repealing the Affordable Care Act was a benchmark of Trump\u2019s campaign. Of the 20 million Americans covered, about 5% are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, Stacy said. The Affordable Care Act has a non-discrimination provision that includes gender identity and sexual orientation. It was especially meaningful for transgender people, who often face discrimination when they try to access gender-affirming health care. Taking away Obamacare would mean removing those protections, Stacy said. But it remains to be seen how Trump would actually do this, leaving groups in a holding pattern for how to respond. As far as we can tell, at no point in the presidential campaign did Vice President-elect Pence talk about supporting conversion therapy, a widely discredited practice that claims to undo homosexuality. But in his run for Congress in 2000, his campaign website said he endorsed using federal funds to support \u201cthose institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\u201d The position has been widely interpreted as signaling Pence\u2019s support for conversion therapy, according to Snopes.com. It got a new life during his run for executive office, leading to panicked calls from LGBT youth who are \u201cterrified\u201d that they\u2019ll be forced into conversion therapy, said Pizer of Lambda Legal. Because the practice has been widely rejected by mental health professionals and outlawed in some states, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it could ever gain credibility or become law, Pizer said \u2013 even with the support of an elected official. \u201cIt\u2019s up to parents to make lots of decisions for their kids, but mental health professionals know that this type of effort to change who people are is not effective,\u201d she said. Though anything could happen, it\u2019s \u201cexceedingly unlikely\u201d that Pence\u2019s opposition to the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d will reverse the decision to let gays and lesbians serve openly in the military, said Warbelow of the HRC. Transgender service began this year, too, signed off on by the chairs of each military branch, she said. \u201cRegulations are not easy to undo,\u201d she said. \u201cThe military leadership of our country feels good about it and all of those people have skills and expertise that our military needs.\u201d Should challenges arise, she reminded people that there will be a notice and comment period for people to raise their voices. \u201cIf you think something is going to affect your future you need to reach out.

            "article_content": "Ryan is in his 7th term, but hasn't been a national leader for Democrats Younger Democrats are unhappy with the lack of opportunities to advance in party leadership Pelosi is expected to fend off Ryan's challenge Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan is calling his bid to oust Nancy Pelosi a \u201cDavid versus Goliath\u201d type clash \u2013 a back bencher competing against the top House Democrat who made history in 2007 when she was sworn in as the first female speaker of the House. \u201cIf you\u2019re a quarterback and you keep throwing interceptions, you change quarterbacks,\u201d the 43-year-old Ryan, a former high school football player, said in a recent interview criticizing the record of Pelosi, 76, and arguing it\u2019s time for a younger generation to take the reins. Ryan\u2019s gambit is unusual because most leadership challenges come from members using another party position or a top slot on a key committee as a launching pad. While he holds seats on two important panels dealing with government spending \u2013 Appropriations and Budget \u2013 he \u200eisn\u2019t the most senior member and hasn\u2019t been the point person for the party on any leading issue. His highest-profile activity was serving as a regular surrogate for Hillary Clinton in the key battleground state of Ohio. Cameras captured him next to the Democratic nominee on St. Patrick\u2019s Day as she sipped a Guinness in a Youngstown bar. Ryan also tag teamed at events in the state with former President Bill Clinton. Tim Ryan: Dems need a 'deep economic message' But Donald Trump won the Ohio by 8 points, part of his Rust Belt sweep. The Democrats\u2019 economic message hasn\u2019t resonated, Ryan said. \u201cWe need a brand as a party that says we\u2019re the party that are going to help working-class people, white people, black people, brown people, gay people, straight people, improve opportunity for them to grow their wages, to have security, economic security. And we got off that message. And when we don\u2019t talk about economics, we lose elections,\u201d Ryan told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. His run is also a warning to Pelosi and other members of the Democrats\u2019 House leadership team that younger lawmakers feel they little chance of advancement. Yet while Ryan\u2019s words could resonate with Democratic voters, convincing his fellow lawmakers to throw out Pelosi in next week\u2019s election and gamble on an untested messenger when facing a Trump presidency and GOP-controlled Congress could be a tougher sell. That\u2019s because leadership elections often hinge on personal relationships. Members cast secret ballots and much of campaigning is done behind the scenes \u2013 in phone calls and personal meetings. Candidates and their supporters tout their ability to devise the broad strategy for the party, but there are also conversations about parochial issues \u2013 request for seats on top committees, boost home with fundraisers, and pledges to make particular issues priorities for the caucus. All those factors favor Pelosi. She has unparalleled experience driving the party\u2019s message, negotiating with Republicans and raising hundreds of millions of dollars for Democratic House candidates \u2013 advantages many Democrats see as critical right now. After Ryan announced he would compete for the post Pelosi\u2019s office declined to respond, in a signal they didn\u2019t view his candidacy as a serious threat. President Barack Obama, asked about the contest during a news conference in Peru over the weekend, said he shouldn\u2019t \u201cmeddle\u201d in internal party contests, but sent the clear message he backs Pelosi. \u201cI cannot speak highly enough of Nancy Pelosi. She combines strong, progressive values with just extraordinary political skill. And she does stuff that\u2019s tough, not just stuff that\u2019s easy. She\u2019s done stuff that\u2019s unpopular in her own base because it\u2019s the right thing to do for the American people. I think she\u2019s a remarkable leader,\u201d Obama said. Ryan is also playing the inside game, spending the weekend in his office the Longworth House Office making calls and holding some one-on-one meetings. But so far only two House Democrats \u2013 Rep. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado and Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York \u2013 have publicly backed his bid for minority leader. And he has kept up the public campaign, appearing on multiple cable news programs a day, in an effort to keep the race in the media spotlight. The seventh-term Democrat got his start in politics as a junior aide to his colorful hometown congressman, Jim Traficant, in 1997. After his first job on the Hill, Ryan left to get a law degree and moved back home to serve in the Ohio legislature.  When Traficant was convicted of corruption charges and expelled from Congress in 2002, Ryan, then 27, decided to challenge a sitting Democrat in the primary. Redistricting changed the contours of the southeast area seat and Ryan defeated Rep. Tom Sawyer and others for the Democratic nomination. His former boss, Traficant, ran from federal prison as an independent, but Ryan won. When he arrived on Capitol Hill in 2003 as the youngest member of the caucus Pelosi created the \u201cthirty something group\u201d to showcase fresher faces and asked Ryan to help lead the group. He made speeches on the House floor and campaigned for other Democrats with the other leaders of the group, including the former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida. In his early congressional career Ryan had a more moderate political profile. Raised Catholic, he had a pro-life voting record, but in 2015 penned an editorial in a Ohio newspaper explaining that over the course of his time in Congress and since becoming a father his views had evolved. \u201cI have come to believe that we must trust women and families \u2013 not politicians \u2013 to make the best decision for their lives,\u201d Ryan wrote in the Akron Beacon Journal. He also earned an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association when he was elected in 2003. But the moderate wing of the Democratic caucus has largely disappeared in recent election cycles and now Ryan stresses his support for expanding background checks, barring those on the government\u2019s \u201cno fly list\u201d from buying guns and other measures opposed by the gun lobby. Critics of Ryan\u2019s note that he has mulled over opportunities in the past to compete for statewide office \u2013 both for governor and for Senate \u2013 in Ohio but ended up taking a pass. Some senior Democratic aides were surprised he decided to take on Pelosi, and believe it may be a way to get his name in the mix to mount a statewide run for in 2018. Michael Zetts, Ryan\u2019s spokesman, pushes back on that notion, telling CNN, \u201cyou don\u2019t challenge this kind of power just to raise your profile. This election is about standing up for working class people, whether they are black, brown or white \u2013 gay or straight \u2013 young or old who feel left out of the process. This is about changing the direction of our party and the country.\u201d During his 14 years in office Ryan has developed close ties to labor unions, and co-founded the manufacturing caucus in the House. He opposed fast track authority for trade deals and in his first race highlighted his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. His supporters stress that he\u2019s not just a messenger that can help the party reach out to the white working class. He has spent time cultivating relationships in the African-American and Latino communities in the Youngstown area \u2013 as the city\u2019s demographics changed with the departure of the manufacturing base there. Tim Ryan full interview Ryan doesn\u2019t have much time to pull off what would be a huge political upset. Pelosi enjoys broad support in the Democratic caucus and claimed in her letter officially launching her bid that she already had support from two-thirds of the members. But one frustration whoever emerges as the minority leader will have to address is the lack of opportunity for advancement for newer members and need for greater geographical diversity in the leadership ranks. Many are frustrated they are stuck in a status quo cycle because the same slate of people continues to make the decisions. Ryan and other Democrats who pressed for more time before the vote point out that there is basically no bench for House Democrats. Over the weekend, he released his own plan for adding more seats at the leadership table for new voices, and limiting how many terms members can remain in some positions. Wasserman Schultz, who called Ryan one of her \u201cclosest friends\u201d on CNN recently, has also pressed for opportunities for younger members, but also said the priority now is dealing with the fight in front of them. \u201cThe reality that we\u2019re facing here is that we are going to be dealing with a \u2013 a legislative train wreck coming at us at warp speed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there is nobody in my mind that is more battle tested and prepared or frankly, savvy enough to be able to go toe to toe with Paul Ryan, the Republican leadership and this really troubling and disturbing administration than Nancy Pelosi.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New Jersey governor has long denied any involvement in the Bridgegate scandal The case stems from the 2013 lane closures on the George Washington Bridge Scandal has thrown into question Chris Christie's political future New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was not on trial in connection with the so-called Bridgegate scandal, but the case has thrown into question the political future of the once-rising Republican star. After more than a month of testimony, a federal jury in Newark on Friday returned guilty verdicts against Christie\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Kelly, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. They were each convicted of seven criminal counts \u2013 including conspiracy and fraud \u2013 for their roles in the September 2013 lane closures on the Fort Lee, New Jersey, side of the George Washington Bridge. Testimony at trial shone an unflattering light on the way business was conducted in the Christie administration. Prosecutors alleged the lane closures, which paralyzed traffic across the bridge from Upper Manhattan, were part of a plot to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who declined to endorse Christie in his 2013 re-election campaign. Christie has long denied knowing about the closures, and he hasn\u2019t been charged with any crime. But the former presidential candidate has been unable to elude scrutiny from a political scandal that tarnished his second term as governor. Now that the Bridgegate trial is over, what\u2019s possibly next for Christie? After the verdict Friday, Christie said he was saddened by the case and by the choices made by people who were once close to him. \u201cLet me be clear once again, I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNo believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.\u201d Still, the door remains open for criminal charges, according to legal experts. If Christie were to face charges stemming from the lane closures, it could be over alleged official misconduct, these experts say. Under state law, a public official can be prosecuted for committing an unauthorized act \u201cwith purpose to obtain a benefit for himself or another or to injure or to deprive another of a benefit.\u201d Such a prosecution, however, is highly unlikely. The Bergen County prosecutor\u2019s office would have to decide whether there is enough evidence to present the case to a grand jury, which would then decide on an indictment. Prosecutors have wide discretion on filing charges. The Bridgegate trial stemmed in part from a series of damning emails and texts made public in January 2014. For instance, one month before the lane closures, with Christie\u2019s re-election campaign in full swing, Kelly texted David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official and a political ally of the governor\u2019s: \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d \u201cGot it,\u201d Wildstein replied. On the stand, Kelly characterized her messages as \u201csarcasm and humor.\u201d She testified that she told Christie about a planned traffic study and potential traffic problems one day before sending that email. In September, Wildstein testified that Christie was informed about the traffic problems at the George Washington Bridge as they were happening. While at ground zero in Manhattan during a memorial event on September 11, 2013, Baroni and Wildstein, then the Port Authority director of interstate capital projects, discussed the traffic issues with Christie, Wildstein testified. Wildstein, the admitted mastermind of the lane closures, testified that Baroni told Christie: \u201cGovernor, I have to tell you there\u2019s a tremendous amount of traffic in Fort Lee this morning, major traffic jams.\u201d Wildstein said Baroni had a sarcastic tone during the conversation. The lane closures, which began two days earlier on September 9, 2013, lasted four days. \u201cYou\u2019ll be pleased to know that Mayor (Mark) Sokolich is having trouble getting his telephone calls returned,\u201d Baroni continued, according to Wildstein. Wildstein said that Christie replied, \u201cI imagine he wouldn\u2019t be getting his calls returned.\u201d Wildstein avoided trial by pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation. In October, Christie was hit with a criminal summons after a municipal judge decided there was probable cause on a citizen\u2019s complaint over the lane closures. In the complaint, Bill Brennan accused the governor of official misconduct, saying Christie \u201cknowingly refrained from ordering that his subordinates take all necessary action to re-open local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge from Fort Lee, New Jersey, that had been closed with purpose to injure Fort Lee mayor Mark Sokolich.\u201d Christie appealed the case, which spokesman Brian Murray called \u201ca dishonorable complaint filed by a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system.\u201d Christie is scheduled to appear in court November 23. The prosecutor\u2019s office did not return a call seeking comment. Stuart Green, a Rutgers University law professor, said it may be difficult to prove misconduct. \u201cEven if he knew (about the lane closings), that\u2019s probably not good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsent some smoking gun that he was himself involved in the planning of the closings, it just seems to me that it would be too hard to get a conviction.\u201d Don\u2019t bet on it. Still, a move by the state Legislature to impeach Christie would be more likely than criminal charges, according to Green. \u201cTo bring a criminal prosecution with criminal penalties is to give that sort of political check to the criminal courts. And I think there\u2019s good reason to think that that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Green, referring to the perils of politicians using the criminal justice system to punish political adversaries. Some state Assembly members have publicly discussed impeachment, but Democrats have said it would be a waste of time since Christie will be out of office soon. \u201cIn modern times, no sitting governor of New Jersey has ever been impeached or charged with a crime,\u201d said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor of political science and law at New Jersey\u2019s Montclair State University. Recent unpopular governors have been voted out of office, and the only one embroiled in scandal resigned, Harrison said. In 2004, Gov. James McGreevey resigned halfway through his term after revealing that he is gay and admitting an extramarital affair with a male staffer. The state Constitution is vague in terms of the grounds for impeachment: \u201cThe Governor and all other State officers, while in office and for two years thereafter, shall be liable to impeachment for misdemeanor committed during their respective continuance in office.\u201d The Assembly has the power to begin impeachment proceedings. A majority vote among its 80 members would lead to a trial in the state Senate. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court would preside. A two-thirds vote by senators is required for a conviction, which could lead to removal from office and a disqualification of holding any other public office in the state. But impeachment is a drawn-out process. The governor\u2019s term expires in January 2018. Harrison said it would be unusual for lawmakers to pursue impeachment, because the Democratic-controlled Legislature prefers to have its gubernatorial nominee next year run against Christie\u2019s legacy, rather than give the Republican lieutenant governor an opportunity to start the race with a clean slate. An ethics complaint over Christie\u2019s handling of the lane closures could result in disbarment or lesser sanctions such as a censure or reprimand. Christie was US attorney for the District of New Jersey from 2002 to 2008. \u201cThey\u2019d have to find a fairly close connection between him and the (lane closure) orders,\u201d Fordham University law professor James Cohen said of the state office of attorney ethics. \u201cOn the other hand, the standard of proof, of course, in that context is not beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Rutgers law professor John Leubsdorf said most grounds for disbarring lawyers turn on acts committed in the representation of a client \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t apply to Christie in this case. However, there are exceptions to the New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct, which say a lawyer may not commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects; engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; or engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. \u201cThe first of these requires only that the lawyer \u2018commit\u2019 a crime, whether or not he\u2019s been convicted,\u201d Leubsdorf said. \u201cIn practice, I doubt that the disciplinary authorities would want to try a complex criminal case, but in theory they could. As to the second, I\u2019m not up on everything the governor might have done, but if he lied to the public about his knowledge of what was happening, that seems to qualify.\u201d Leubsdorf added, \u201cIn short, the governor could be disciplined if he was dishonest, or (in theory but probably not in practice) if the disciplinary system found he committed a crime.\u201d Some experts believe Bridgegate could lead to other investigations. Federal prosecutors said the traffic-choking lane closures were intended to punish Fort Lee\u2019s mayor for not supporting Christie\u2019s re-election bid. \u201cIn my mind, the key question that has emerged as a result of trial concerns the idea of a quid pro quo surrounding endorsement,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThat raises the question of what the 60 Democrats who did endorse Christie received for their endorsements. That is the landmine where corruption could potentially be demonstrated: Was there a quid pro quo for endorsements received? If I were the state Legislature, that\u2019s the question I\u2019d be asking.\u201d Were mayors who endorsed Christie rewarded in any way? \u201cThere\u2019s the punishment, but there\u2019s also I\u2019m sure the reward,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a CNN contributor. \u201cWhat were the rewards? Were the rewards legitimate? Or, as with the punishment, were there certain rewards that were beyond the boundaries of what should be permissible?\u201d Though Christie has said he plans to retire from public life at the end of his term, a victory by Republican Donald Trump in the presidential election could breathe new life into the governor\u2019s political career. Christie heads the team planning a potential Trump administration. Christie, who is 54, could always decide on another presidential run. \u201cLots of people recover,\u201d said Ben Dworkin, a political science professor at Rider University. \u201cIt\u2019s politics. We have second and third acts. Richard Nixon came back. But Christie\u2019s tenure has not endeared him with the state GOP, according to Harrison. \u201cBehind closed doors, most Republicans will tell you that they are waiting for Christie era to be over so that they can begin the process of rebuilding,\u201d she said. Others said they believe Christie has been hurt politically by his association with Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether law firms would consider him toxic,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody is going to welcome him with open arms in terms of a law firm. I think that significant, big corporations are going to say he\u2019s maybe not the guy we want as the face of our company in court.\u201d Cohen added, \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s going to be on the street with a tin can, but I think his prospects don\u2019t look perhaps as exciting as they did when he threw his hat in the ring. I could see him doing a politics show with Trump.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Students at the largest Christian university in the world are protesting their president\u2019s support of Donald Trump, saying that the Republican presidential nominee \u201cis actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.\u201d Some student body members of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, posted a detailed letter taking a stand against their university president ,Jerry Falwell, Jr., an early Trump supporter who has invited political candidates like Trump, Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders and Mike Pence to speak at before his students. A student group called Liberty United Against Trump published their grievances online. \u201cWe are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell\u2019s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history,\u201d according to a tweet from the group\u2019s social media coordinator Tyler McNally. Another member of the group, Dustin Wahl, told CNN in an email that since publishing the letter at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, they had more than 200 signatures from fellow students by Wednesday evening. The students took action so that \u201cthe world understands how many Liberty students do not support President Falwell in his endorsement of Donald Trump.\u201d The letter said that if any Liberty University faculty or staff member had made the comments Trump made on the tape, they would have been terminated. \u201cBecause our president has lead the world to believe that Liberty University supports Donald Trump, we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that Donald Trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support,\u201d the letter states. Falwell Jr. appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett Out Front\u201d on Wednesday evening and was asked about the breaking allegations of groping against Trump from The New York Times. The Trump campaign has denied the claims and asked The New York Times for a retraction.  Falwell Jr. said that he did not know anything about the reports, and reiterated that the Trump campaign is denying the claims. \u201cI take him at his word. I think he\u2019s a good man. I know the Donald Trump of today,\u201d he told Erin Burnett. \u201cI know that he was \u2013 his first major hire was to bring Mike Pence on as his vice presidential candidate. And he spoke at Liberty University today and he had 10,000 Evangelical Christian young people cheering for him, gave him five standing ovations, and that is the Donald Trump I know.\u201d Burnett pressed him on whether he could forgive Trump if he had lied about grabbing women\u2019s breasts and genitals. Falwell said: \u201cIt is not up to me to forgive anybody. I\u2019m not Jesus Christ. It is only Jesus who can forgive. And he can forgive anybody. All of us, we\u2019re all redeemable. And like I said, it\u2019s \u2013 Jesus was accused of being a friend of sinners and when he was here on earth and it is not up to us to forgive. \u201c He defended Trump for taking \u201call the right positions on all the issues.\u201d Burnett played a video clip of Trump at the Fox primary debate last year when Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly asked him about comments he\u2019d made about women in the past. \u201cI\u2019m a college president. I\u2019m an attorney. He has his own style. He has his own way of saying things. He\u2019s a New York businessman. He grew up in a different culture than I did,\u201d Falwell told CNN. \u201cWhat sounds raunchy to me might not sound raunchy to him. But the point is, I think he\u2019s a changed man. I think he has seen the pain of the American people. I think the reason that he\u2019s come so far in this campaign, in this election is because he is not for the elitist. He\u2019s for the average American.\u201d Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence spoke at Liberty University\u2019s weekly convocation on Wednesday morning, addressing thousands of students and sharing his personal journey of finding faith and garnering a standing ovation for comments like \u201cI\u2019m pro-life and I don\u2019t apologize for it.\u201d Pence even addressed the tapes of Trump making lewd and sexually explicit comments about women that came out on Friday night. \u201cAs a believer we\u2019re called to aspire to live godly lives but also we recognize that we all fall short. It\u2019s not about condoning what is said and done, it\u2019s about believing in graces and forgiveness. As Christians we\u2019re called to forgive even as we\u2019ve been forgiven,\u201d he said to students sitting in sweatshirts in the chilling morning. Wahl said the student group drafted the letter two days ago. \u201cWe had been planning to make this statement public regardless of Mike Pence, but we timed the launch to fit with the height of conversation about Pence\u2019s convocation,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's camp says he hasn't invited Gennifer Flowers to Monday's debate Flowers had an affair with Bill Clinton in the 1970s Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager and running mate said Sunday the GOP candidate doesn\u2019t want Gennifer Flowers \u2013 who had an affair with Bill Clinton in the 1970s \u2013 at Monday night\u2019s presidential debate. \u201cWe have not invited her formally, and we do not expect her to be there as a guest of the Trump campaign,\u201d Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Clinton, Trump poised for historic debate battle Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace that Trump\u2019s suggestion he\u2019d invite Flowers was just \u201cmocking\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign for distracting from the real issues at stake on Monday night. Their comments come after Trump tweeted that he was considering inviting Flowers to sit in the front row for the first debate. The back-and-forth about Flowers comes as a new poll shows the race is dead even going into a debate that\u2019s expected to be the biggest in history \u2013 with 100 million or more viewers \u2013 and another survey finds as many as one-third of voters say the first face off will be key to their decisions on who to support in the 2016 presidential race. Donald Trump\u2019s 6 debate tactics Trump brought up Flowers after Mark Cuban \u2013 the billionaire owner of the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks and a Trump critic \u2013 tweeted that he\u2019d been invited by Clinton\u2019s campaign to sit in the front row at the debate. In a response on Twitter, Trump mocked Cuban\u2019s short-lived reality TV show \u201cThe Benefactor\u201d \u2013 which was similar to Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d (Cuban is now featured on a more successful reality show, \u201cShark Tank.\u201d) Trump wrote: \u201cIf dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!\u201d If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him! The New York Times reported that Flowers told the newspaper in a text message, \u201cYes I will be there.\u201d However, Conway denied that Trump\u2019s campaign had invited Flowers \u2013 whose affair with Clinton was revealed in the 1990s \u2013 and blamed Clinton\u2019s campaign for the topic even coming up, saying the former secretary of state was \u201ceasily baited.\u201d Asked if Trump will raise the Clintons\u2019 marital history or Bill Clinton\u2019s affairs in the debate, Conway said \u201cthere\u2019s no plan to do that.\u201d Clinton camp wants candidates held to equal standard \u201cMr. Trump will answer the questions as they are asked by Lester Holt, the moderator, and he has a right to defend himself against anything Mrs. Clinton \u2013 Secretary Clinton \u2013 may say in response,\u201d Conway said. It\u2019s not the first time Trump has raised Bill Clinton\u2019s marital affairs in political attacks on Hillary Clinton. He did so repeatedly as she clinched the Democratic nomination, accusing Hillary Clinton of mistreating the women involved in her husband\u2019s affairs. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the episode reflected Trump\u2019s broader campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning sign before the debate has even started about Donald Trump\u2019s lack of fitness \u2013 his bullying tactics \u2013 that make him unfit to be president,\u201d Mook said. Clinton\u2019s invitation to Cuban \u2013 a billionaire who has questioned Trump\u2019s wealth, suggest the billionaire\u2019s \u201cdream scenario\u201d is to lose the election, and has cast Trump as substance-free \u2013 and the GOP candidate\u2019s raising of Flowers comes as the candidates play head games ahead of the debate. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that one-third of voters say the debate will be \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cquite\u201d important in their decision on who to support for president. Clinton, Trump prepare to square off at first debate The two enter the debate virtually tied. An ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Clinton\u2019s lead is 2 percentage points \u2013 with likely voters split 46% for Clinton, 44% for Trump, 5% supporting Libertarian Gary Johnson and 1% for the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein. That\u2019s well within the poll\u2019s 4.5 percentage point margin of error. Clinton\u2019s debate prep sessions Saturday went late into the night, with her motorcade only returning to her Chappaqua, New York, home at 11:45 p.m. ET. Clinton, along with her top aides, is continuing debate preparations on Sunday at a hotel and conference center in Rye Brook, New York, while both she and Trump are separately meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In Clinton\u2019s debate prep sessions, Trump is being played by Philippe Reines, the combustible long-time aide. Clinton running mate Tim Kaine said the former secretary of state will defend herself from Trump and \u201cpaint this positive vision that really is what\u2019s animating her to run for president.\u201d The Virginia senator said the debate will offer voters a window into whether the candidates\u2019 remarks come with depth and truthfulness. \u201cIn a 90-minute format, not 20-second sound bites, there\u2019s a real opportunity to hear somebody say something and then get into, \u2018Is that actually true or not?\u2019\u201d Kaine told CBS\u2019 John Dickerson on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday. \u201cSo I think the debate issue, you know, obviously let it be an even standard for both. But that issue about specifics, answering those unanswered questions and checking people on truthfulness \u2013 that\u2019s going to be very important.\u201d 8 unforgettable presidential debate blunders Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was at Trump Tower on Sunday to help Trump with debate prep, said they aren\u2019t doing mock debates \u2013 \u201cwe go over issues.\u201d Biggest blunders made in past debates \u201cWe\u2019ll do some more strategizing about what I think will be probably one of the most important presidential debates in American history. The Nixon-Kennedy was the most famous, but this will have an audience that is far greater,\u201d Giuliani said. He predicted Trump will do \u201cvery, very well,\u201d and that Trump doesn\u2019t want to be over-rehearsed. \u201cIf you got to over-prepare, you over-prepare. But if you have confidence in yourself, you go with what got you there,\u201d Giuliani said. He took a shot at Clinton, too, for spending several days focused largely on preparing for Monday night\u2019s first of three presidential debates. \u201cLooks to me like she hasn\u2019t appeared for about four days. Hope everything is OK, and I wish her well,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI think if I spent as much time inside as she does I\u2019d go stir crazy. So that\u2019s me. Everybody is different.\u201d READ: Why the debate expectations game is a farce House Speaker Paul Ryan said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Trump should \u201cover-prepare\u201d for Monday night. 50 years of presidential debate moments \u201cLook, Hillary Clinton\u2019s been doing this most of her life. She is the consummate pro. This is new for Donald,\u201d Ryan, R-Wisconsin, told host John Dickerson. \u201cSo I think he should obviously over-prepare for it. \u2026 You have to offer the country a vision, go on offense, prosecute your case, hold your opponent accountable,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut then show the country the direction you want to go \u2013 and prepare, prepare, prepare. And I hope he\u2019s doing that.\u201d Ahead of the debate, Clinton\u2019s campaign also launched a new attack ad, suggesting Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns is linked to his Russian business ties. The ad is airing nationally on cable TV. Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources,\u201d where he reiterated the campaign\u2019s call for fact-checking at the debate. \u201cIf you have a moderator that takes a hands off approach, and says that they are not going to fact-check the candidates, that they are going to sit there and close their ears to Donald Trump\u2019s lies, it will extend an unfair bias to Donald Trump. It will be the equivalent of giving him for time to speak,\u201d Fallon said. Fallon cited Trump\u2019s frequent, false claim that he opposed the Iraq War from the beginning, and said, if Trump lies about his position on the Iraq War, \u201c(Moderator) Lester Holt should follow up.\u201d He also took a dig at Conway, saying she \u201cwill breathe a sigh of relief probably if he (Trump) gets through 90 minutes without having a meltdown.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, Elizabeth Landers and Eli Watkins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Right-wing conspiracies about Clinton's health have long circulated Clinton doc: She is in 'excellent mental condition' When an \u201coverheated and dehydrated\u201d Hillary Clinton stumbled into a van as she left a 9/11 memorial ceremony on Sunday morning, conspiracy theorists rejoiced. A few hours later, after it was revealed she had come down with pneumonia \u2013 a common illness now being treated with antibiotics and a few days\u2019 rest \u2013 they got back to work, retrofitting baseless and lurid suggestions about her health. The weekend wobble was treated by some political rivals and online antagonists as validation \u2013 proof positive that the Democratic nominee was unfit, in the most literal terms, for the presidency. A shadow campaign pushing rumors that Clinton is hiding a grave illness to protect her White House aspirations has existed for years, but only found a voice and high-profile champions during the last few months of this general election contest. that's one sick wobble Hillary's got https://t.co/y140TdK2q0 Even as Clinton took a brief leave from the stump \u2013 she is set to resume travel on Thursday \u2013 her campaign wrestled with legitimate questions about a lack of transparency during the Sunday scare, the rumor mill churned apace. Donald Trump, who has considerably been less open about his health, was mostly restrained in the aftermath \u2013 though he did couch his well wishes with some goading analysis, saying on Monday: \u201cI just see what I see \u2013 the coughing fit was a week ago, so I assume that was pneumonia also.\u201d Or not. Facts have rarely gotten in the way of dubious suggestions about Clinton\u2019s health. In a letter released Wednesday, her physician made a point of stating that the candidate \u201cis in excellent mental condition.\u201d Here \u2013 quite apart from any legitimate concern stemming from her recent illness \u2013 are a few of the more ludicrous and resilient theories: In the aftermath of the Sunday incident, web sleuths turned up a series of images they believe show the Clinton campaign used a \u201cbody double\u201d to reassure the public and trick the press. Collected under the hashtag, #HillarysBodyDouble, photographs of the candidate before and after she fell ill are being compared, as features like her nose, ears and fingers are plotted side-by-side for examination and debate. \u201cShocking claims are coming forward about a body double and who really emerged from (daughter) Chelsea\u2019s apartment [on Sunday],\u201d blared the right wing Madworldnews.com. This is getting serious now #HillarysBodyDouble pic.twitter.com/FpTuxTw82I totally agree w you \ud83d\udc4d earlobes don't lie pic.twitter.com/XPwBE3QaO5 The writer goes on to ask: \u201cWas it (longtime Clinton impersonator) Teresa Barnwell outside Chelsea\u2019s apartment yesterday, hired to salvage Hillary\u2019s campaign as it was imploding after the collapse?\u201d Barnwell responded to the suggestions \u2013 spreading across social media \u2013 that she had stood in for Clinton with a tweet of her own. \u201cI\u2019m in Los Angeles today,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNot in NYC!\u201d I'm in Los Angeles today. Not in NYC! Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist whose role in highlighting the aftereffects of head trauma on former NFL players was dramatized by Will Smith in a recent film, weighed in with his own theory on Sunday night. \u201cI must advice (sic) the Clinton campaign to perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton\u2019s blood,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt is possible she is being poisoned.\u201d I must advice the Clinton campaign to perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton's blood. It is possible she is being poisoned. Omalu is, on the face of it, a more credible source and discerning eye, but, though a doctor, he has not examined Clinton. Rather than expand on his medical reasoning, he followed up a little less than an hour later with a cryptic tweet: \u201cI do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. With those two all things are possible.\u201d I do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. With those two all things are possible. Though Putin\u2019s government has been implicated in the 2006 poisoning death of a former KGB operative in London, there is no evidence \u2013 and nothing in any of Clinton\u2019s medical notices, provided by her physician \u2013 to suggest anything of the sort is at play here. The bulk of the most prominent healther conspiracies center on Clinton\u2019s December 2012 concussion, suffered after she fainted while sick with a stomach virus. Clinton\u2019s injury caused her to postpone planned testimony on the Benghazi attack, leading right-wing skeptics to accuse the then-secretary of state of coming down with a \u201cdiplomatic illness\u201d \u2013 or faking it. Those whispers died by the end of the month, when doctors discovered a blood clot in the vein behind her right ear during a follow-up exam. Clinton was treated with blood thinners and she testified to Senate and House committees a few weeks later, on January 23, 2013. Multiple currently circulating theories attach themselves to the 2012 fall, including one pushed by Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson, who in August offered matter-of-factly that Clinton was suffering from dysphasia, a neurological disorder that complicates speech and language comprehension due to brain trauma or disease. \u201cWhat\u2019s new are the other reports of the observations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s behavior and mannerisms,\u201d Pierson said during an appearance on MSNBC, after being asked why the campaign was indulging the rumors. \u201cSpecifically with what you just showed in those previous clips, as well as her dysphasia, the fact that she\u2019s fallen, she has had a concussion.\u201d Sean Hannity peddling debunked Clinton story Meanwhile, a Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel \u2013 who himself has noted that he is \u201cnot a neurologist\u201d \u2013 pushed a similar line. \u201cI saw the same video you saw, and I\u2019m wondering about a word called \u2018aphasia,\u2019 where you\u2019re searching for words, you suddenly lose those words, and that can be the sign, again, of some kind of traumatic brain injury or the after-effects of a concussion,\u201d he said on pro-Trump commentator Sean Hannity\u2019s show. The list of purported maladies goes on. Karl Rove, the former top adviser to President George W. Bush, suggested in 2014 Clinton had been \u201cwearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury,\u201d while assorted right-wing sites and Twitter trolls have suggested she is prone to seizures \u2013 a belief that sprung a new theory claiming a Secret Service agent\u2019s flashlight was really an \u201can auto-injector with Diazepam.\u201d Other have mused that she could be suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease. The conservative Powerline blog featured an anonymous letter on Sunday, from who it described as a \u201cprominent internist,\u201d suggesting Clinton\u2019s pneumonia was related to Parkinson\u2019s: \u201cI raise this second possibility,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause of Hillary\u2019s history of neurological illnesses (blood clot in brain, concussion), hints raised on the internet in Wikileaks documents and by others that she may have a neurological disease like Parkinson\u2019s, and her by now well documented history of recurrent coughing fits. This second possibility is that she has an aspiration pneumonia.\u201d The first possibility, stated at the top, was that she simply had contracted the illness, like any other \u201chealthy person living her usual life.\u201d Others, if you feel like further plumbing the depths of ungrounded theories, include: Lupus, HIV and \u201cimminent heart failure\u201d event \u2013 only months away.",

            "article_content": "The funds are a surprising infusion of cash Dustin Moskovitz has never before been active in politics A co-founder of Facebook is donating $20 million of his fortune to Democratic coffers in a late and likely consequential move to help defeat Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The funds are a surprising infusion of cash from an individual who has never before been active in politics. Dustin Moskovitz, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a net worth of more than $10 billion, announced early Friday that he and his wife would make a historically large donation to a half-dozen Democratic groups, including those backing Hillary Clinton. The donations, once issued, will make Moskovitz the third most generous donor in the 2016 campaign. Clinton super PAC hauls in $21M in record-setting August \u201cThis decision was not easy, particularly because we have reservations about anyone using large amounts of money to influence elections,\u201d Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna, wrote in a post on Medium. \u201cWe hope these efforts make it a little more likely that Secretary Clinton is able to pursue the agenda she\u2019s outlined, and serve as a signal to the Republican Party that by running this kind of campaign\u200a\u2014\u200aone built on fear and hostility\u200a\u2014\u200aand supporting this kind of candidate, they compel people to act in response.\u201d Moskovitz said $5 million would go to a super PAC run by the League of Conservation Voters, an environmentalist group running advertising and canvassing campaigns; and another $5 million to For Our Future PAC, an effort by organized labor and environmentalists to run a consolidated, high-powered field program. Other donations will be split between a joint fundraising committee for Hillary Clinton; the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; a political arm of MoveOn.Org; Color of Change PAC; and \u201cseveral nonpartisan voter registration and GOTV efforts.\u201d Though Democratic groups are not hurting for cash, the September gifts could potentially open new avenues for Democratic groups looking to recapture control of Congress or defeat Trump. And the sheer size of the gift will make the 32-year-old one of the most sought-after and unlikeliest donors in the 2016 campaign. Moskovitz, a college roommate of Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, has not been particularly active in politics. He has only cut two checks before to candidates \u2014 both to New York congressional candidate Sean Eldridge, the husband of another Facebook co-founder \u2014 that amounted to $5,200. \u201cCari and I have dedicated our lives to figuring out how to do the most good we can with the resources we\u2019ve been given. Until now, those efforts have not included making endorsements or contributions in presidential elections,\u201d Moskovitz wrote. \u201cThe Republican Party, and Donald Trump in particular, is running on a zero-sum vision, stressing a false contest between their constituency and the rest of the world.\u201d The $20 million will give new life to several Democratic groups, though Moskovitz\u2019s list notably omits Priorities USA, the principal super PAC supporting Clinton\u2019s campaign. Pro-Trump super PAC led by Rick Scott struggles post-Manafort departure Moskovitz told CNN that he was not ruling out a donation to Priorities USA and that his giving could eclipse the initial $20 million pledge. \u201cNo further donations have been decided. We will say more if that changes.\u201d Moskovitz will only be out punched as a donor by Tom Steyer, the California billionaire and Democratic activist who has given more than $30 million to his groups in the 2016 cycle; and Bob Mercer, a major Trump supporter who has given just a drop more than Moskovitz\u2019s $20 million to Republican groups in this election. Steyer has also made a major donation to For Our Future PAC, which is aiming to raise $50 million to back the Democratic ticket. The largest donor so far to the League of Conservation Voters is a British investor, who gave a total of $2.5 million this summer.",

            "article_content": "Jake Anantha, the man escorted out of the rally, said he is a Trump supporter The 18-year-old from Charlotte said he feels that he was racially profiled for being half-Indian A man who identified himself as half-Indian was escorted out of a Donald Trump rally on Thursday out of concern that he was a protester, but the man insisted he was a Trump supporter and said he feels that he was racially profiled. Jake Anantha, an 18-year-old from Charlotte, was approached by a member of Trump\u2019s security team and then ushered out by police. He was told that he resembled another man who had previously disrupted Trump rallies. \u201cI told him I\u2019ve never been to another rally in my life,\u201d Anantha said. \u201cI\u2019m a huge Trump supporter. I would never protest against Trump.\u201d Anantha later tweeted that he would be voting for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in November. \u201cI will definitely be voting Johnson on November 8th,\u201d he wrote Friday. Anantha is a registered Republican, according to state voter records, who registered to vote in March. Anantha, who said he\u2019s a student at Central Piedmont Community College, was wearing a pro-Trump shirt with another pro-Trump shirt underneath. Campaign reboot: Trump expresses regret for saying \u2018the wrong thing,\u2019 doesn\u2019t specify \u201cI do think it\u2019s because I\u2019m brown,\u201d Anantha said, explaining why he believes he was kicked out. He added that he was \u201ctotally shocked.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment about the incident. Requests for comment from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department have not been returned. It\u2019s not unusual for known demonstrators who have been previously spotted at Trump rallies to be asked to leave. A Muslim woman, Rose Hamid, was also kicked out of the rally Thursday night. She had been escorted from at least one Trump rally in the past for peacefully protesting and had previously been interviewed by major media outlets, including CNN. Attempting to verify his political beliefs, Anantha said he was a conservative and expressed views in line with those of Trump, including opposition to Black Lives Matter protesters, who were demonstrating Thursday night outside the venue, and his belief that \u201cradical Islam is a large threat to our country.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s first general election TV ad draws contrast with Clinton on crime, security \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what was going on,\u201d he said of the incident. \u201cObviously now I\u2019m very angry. I\u2019ve wasted a bunch of time coming here. I may have wasted six months of my life supporting Donald Trump, who doesn\u2019t even let me come to his rallies.\u201d At the time, although Anantha said the incident prompted him to question his support for Trump, he maintained he won\u2019t be voting for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said.",

By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said. He added: \u201cBut I tell you what, that will be a horrible day, if Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now we\u2019re tied.\u201d Trump\u2019s ambiguous comments alarmed some political observers as to whether he was threatening her life or calling for increased political activity. Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, issued a two-sentence statement in response to Trump. \u201cThis is simple \u2013 what Trump is saying is dangerous. A person seeking to the be president of the United States should not suggest violence in any way,\u201d he said. \"A person seeking to be the President of the United States should not suggest violence in any way.\" pic.twitter.com/Uu55CBCqdK Trump defended his comments Tuesday, insisting that he was telling his supporters to use the power of their vote to stop Clinton from appointing justices who could restrict their Second Amendment rights. \u201cThis is a political movement. This is a strong political movement, the Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said to Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. \u201cAnd there can be no other interpretation. Even reporters have told me. I mean, give me a break.\u201d But Trump\u2019s controversial remarks earlier Tuesday pointed to a scenario under which Clinton would be appointing Supreme Court judges \u2013 meaning Election Day would be long gone. Reality Check: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on the Second AmendmentJason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser, said in a statement that Trump was merely talking about Second Amendment supporters large influence as a group. \u201cIt\u2019s called the power of unification \u2013 2nd Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power.

It suggests either a very bad taste with reference to political assassination and an attempt at humor or an incredible insensitivity \u2013 it maybe the latter \u2013 an incredible insensitivity to the prevalence of political assassination inside of American history,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a topic that we don\u2019t ever come close to, even when we think we are trying to be lighthearted.\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, who supports increased gun control measures, tweeted: \u201cDon\u2019t treat this as a political misstep.

Giuliani insisted Trump told voters \u201cyou have the power to do something about it,\u201d meaning that his supporters \u201chave the power to vote against\u201d and \u201ccampaign against\u201d Clinton. \u201cThey spin out that what he meant by that was that it was a joke, and that what he meant by that was that they would kill her,\u201d Giuliani said as the crowd dropped to a deafening silence, before erupting in boos. \u201cNow, OK, to buy that you have to be corrupt because if you sent that to me I would say to you are you out of your mind?\u201d he added. \u201cI saw it, I heard it, I know what it meant.\u201d Tim Kaine, Clinton\u2019s running mate, said Trump\u2019s remarks show \u201cjust no understanding for the role of leader.\u201d \u201cI just think it\u2019s a window into the soul of a person who is tempermentally not suited for the task,\u201d he said.

By the way, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d Trump said before pausing and adding: \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were the latest example of his unscripted style causing him political headaches, at a time when he has been trying to get his campaign back on track after a string of self inflicted political missteps last week. Clinton supporters immediately seized on Trump\u2019s remarks to warn that Trump had crossed a grave line in political discourse. \u201d.@realDonaldTrump makes death threats because he\u2019s a pathetic coward who can\u2019t handle the fact that he\u2019s losing to a girl,\u201d she said. .@realDonaldTrump makes death threats because he's a pathetic coward who can\u2019t handle the fact that he\u2019s losing to a girl. An anti-Trump super PAC \u201cDemocratic Coalition Against Trump\u201d said the FBI should investigate the Republican nominee. \u201cThere is no place in American politics for this kind of disgusting rhetoric,\u201d said the group\u2019s senior adviser, Scott Dworkin. \u201cDonald Trump should immediately drop out of the race, and he should be arrested for committing a federal crime. Liberal grass roots organization MoveOn.org called on every Republican up and down the ballot to repudiate Trump over his remark. \u201cIt is beyond outrageous. And, it is beyond disgusting. It is flat out dangerous,\u201d said Ilya Sheyman, the organization\u2019s executive director. Trump has repeatedly suggested that Clinton will \u201cabolish\u201d the Second Amendment. The former secretary of state has never called for the abolition of gun rights, but has called for additional gun regulations and safety checks to reduce the number of deadly gun shootings in the US. Trump has vowed not to further restrict gun purchases in the US and earned the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, the pro-gun lobby.

            "article_content": "Sally Bradshaw, a top adviser to Jeb Bush, is leaving the GOP because of Trump's presidential nomination. She says if the presidential race in Florida is close, she will vote for Hillary Clinton. Jeb Bush\u2019s top adviser, Sally Bradshaw, has left the Republican Party to become an independent, and says if the presidential race in Florida is close, she\u2019ll vote for Hillary Clinton. Bradshaw, who\u2019s been close to the former Florida governor for decades and was senior adviser to his 2016 campaign, officially switched her registration to unaffiliated. She told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel in an email interview that the GOP is \u201cat a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist \u2013 a misogynist \u2013 a bigot.\u201d \u201cThis is a time when country has to take priority over political parties. Donald Trump cannot be elected president,\u201d Bradshaw said. The departure from the Republican Party of a Bush loyalist \u2013 Bradshaw began her career working for George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign \u2013 is the latest sign of an influential and respected member of the GOP establishment turning against Trump. Did Trump go too far? \u201cThis election cycle is a test,\u201d Bradshaw said. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want another four years of (President Barack) Obama\u2019s policies, I can\u2019t look my children in the eye and tell them I voted for Donald Trump. I can\u2019t tell them to love their neighbor and treat others the way they wanted to be treated, and then vote for Donald Trump. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d Her decision comes amid controversy over Trump\u2019s criticism of the family of an Muslim-American soldier killed in action in Iraq in 2004. Bradshaw called that remark \u201cdespicable,\u201d saying it \u201cmade me sick to my stomach.\u201d Khan calls on GOP leaders to stop Donald Trump \u201cDonald Trump belittled a woman who gave birth to a son who died fighting for the United States. If anything, that reinforced my decision to become an independent voter,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery family who loses a loved one in service to our country or who has a family member who serves in the military should be honored, regardless of their political views. Vets and their family have more than earned the right to those views. Someone with the temperament to be president would understand and respect that.\u201d Bradshaw said the latest incident reinforced how she was feeling about the decision she\u2019s long weighed. Her move goes beyond what other Republicans have said or done, although many top leaders in the GOP \u2013 including Sen. John McCain, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Mitch McConnell, among others \u2013 have made it clear that they have a big problem with Trump\u2019s comments about a Gold Star family. But none have, as of yet, withdrawn their endorsements or support. \u201cI\u2019ve been considering the switch for months. Ultimately, I could not abide the hateful rhetoric of Donald Trump and his complete lack of principles and conservative philosophy,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t make this decision lightly \u2013 I have worked hard to make our party a place where all would feel welcome. But Trump has taken the GOP in another direction, and too many Republicans are standing by and looking the other way.\u201d Bradshaw served as Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign manager when Bush ran unsuccessfully for Florida governor in the early 1990s and again four years later when he won. Khizr Khan: Trump has a \u2018black soul\u2019 Bradshaw said she hasn\u2019t yet decided who she\u2019ll vote for \u2013 though \u201cit obviously won\u2019t be Trump. I haven\u2019t made a decision yet between Clinton, Gary Johnson or writing in a candidate.\u201d \u201cIf the race in Florida is close, I will vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a very difficult statement for me to make. I disagree with her on several important issues. I have worked to elect Republicans to national and statewide offices for the last 30 years. I have never voted for a Democrat for president, and I consider myself a conservative, a supporter of limited government, gun rights, free enterprise, equality of opportunity. I am pro-life. There are no other candidates who were serious contenders for the nomination that I would not have supported. \u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are at a crossroads and have nominated a total narcissist \u2013 a misogynist \u2013 a bigot. This is a time when country has to take priority over political parties. Donald Trump cannot be elected president.\u201d Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up Analyzing the GOP primary in which Jeb Bush failed to attract a significant share of the vote and dropped out early, Bradshaw pointed to a fractured field, with Trump able to consistently capture one-third of the vote early. \u201cI really fault the candidates who did not speak out against Trump until the end of the primary cycle. Lindsay Graham and Jeb Bush spoke out early and consistently \u2013 but most did not, fearful of offending that segment of the party or positioning themselves for future office,\u201d she said in her email. Bradshaw said she sees voting against Trump as \u201cthe only real choice for reasonable, thoughtful Republicans to make.\u201d \u201cOur president must represent what is good about America \u2013 a belief in opportunity for all \u2013 regardless of race and gender and background \u2013 to rise up and live the American dream,\u201d she said. \u201cA president can\u2019t tear down Hispanics, or mock someone who is disabled, or use symbols in campaign literature that Jewish voters understandably find offensive. To continue to be the hope of the world, all Americans regardless of party affiliation have to reject him.\u201d She added: \u201cIf and when the party regains its sanity, I\u2019ll be ready to return. But until Republicans send a message to party leadership that this cannot stand, nothing will ever change.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Kaine has been chosen as Hillary Clinton's vice presidential nominee His advocacy for gun control puts him in line with the Clinton camp Tim Kaine refers to April 16, 2007, as the worst day of his life. Kaine, then the governor of Virginia, had landed in Japan for an Asia trade mission. Shortly after arriving at his hotel, Kaine was awoken by a phone call from his chief-of-staff: a gunman had opened fire at Virginia Tech. Kaine immediately flew back to the United States and would soon learn that 32 people were killed in the massacre, marking the worst mass shooting in the country\u2019s history up to that point. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up More than nine years later, Kaine has been chosen as Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential nominee, and with a series of recent shootings once again thrusting the issue of guns to the forefront of national politics, Kaine\u2019s response to Virginia Tech and his work to promote gun control and safety measures loom larger than ever. This part of Kaine\u2019s biography will no doubt be a prominent part of his story as a vice presidential nominee. It could also help Democrats win Virginia for the third presidential election in a row after years of being a GOP stronghold. Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly was chairman of Fairfax County at the time of the Virginia Tech shooting, the county where the gunman and several of the victims were from. In an interview with CNN, Connolly said he vividly remembers Kaine swiftly assuming the role of \u201chealer-in-chief\u201d in the aftermath of the tragedy. \u201cHe took an issue that had to be a searing experience for him and in many ways a defining issue of his governorship, and he met the test,\u201d said Connolly, who has been friends with Kaine for decades. \u201cWhen I say it commends him for consideration (for vice president), I\u2019m understating it: How many other people you\u2019re look at went through that kind of trial by fire?\u201d Immediately upon returning to the county after the shooting, Kaine joined President George W. Bush at a convocation honoring the victims of the massacre. His speech that day, where he urged students and faculty to hold onto its sense of community even in its darkest moment, has been heralded one of the most powerful moments of his four years as governor. \u201cHe was a calming and unifying voice,\u201d said state Sen. Donald McEachin, a Democrat who has known Kaine for decades. \u201cThat was a horrible, horrible incident but his eloquence and his voice began the healing process on that tragic day.\u201d Kaine, himself a gun-owner, also convened a commission to examine what had gone wrong. The panelists made a series of recommendations on guns, campus safety and mental health. Kaine pushed through some of those proposed changes, including an executive order to ensure individuals legally declared mentally ill or dangerous would be registered into a national database and barred from purchasing weapons. But the Republican legislature at the time would not take up a universal background check system \u2013 something Kaine believed could have prevented the gunman from getting his hands on firearms. It was a frustrating setback for Kaine, who had gambled his political capital on gun control in a historically pro-gun, Republican-leaning state. Brian Shepard, Kaine\u2019s top domestic policy adviser at the time, said Virginia Tech had the affect of taking \u201coff the table any hesitation about trying and failing\u201d on the issue of gun control. \u201cThe hesitation usually came from the rest of us (at the governor\u2019s office): concentrate on the ones we can get done and let\u2019s not fight the fights we can\u2019t win and that took all that off the table,\u201d Shepard said. After Virginia Tech, Shepard said, \u201cthis was something we were going to work for regardless of the outcome and the politics.\u201d Since being elected to the Senate in 2012, Kaine has continued to be an outspoken advocate of gun control. Last month, after a gunman opened fire at a nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 people, Democrats on Capitol Hill once again called on their Republican colleagues to take up gun reform. In a remarkable scene, House Democrats launched a \u201csit-in\u201d protest on the House floor, demanding a vote on measure to expand background checks and ban the sale of guns to individuals on the no-fly watch list. Kaine joined his colleagues across the Rotunda in the sit-in. And the previous week, he and his Senate colleagues had participated in a 14-hour filibuster calling for gun control reform, led by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy. On the Senate floor, Kaine spoke about the Virginia Tech shooting, calling his inability to pass a universal background check in its aftermath his \u201ceverlasting regret.\u201d \u201cWe have scar tissue in my town. We have scar tissue in my Commonwealth. We have scar tissue in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do we need to be passive? Why do we need to do nothing? We resolved to do better and do more. Yet here in this body, we can\u2019t.\u201d In just the first weeks of the 2016 general election, Clinton has had to address multiple shootings \u2014 including two that forced her campaign to delay major rallies with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Her public push for comprehensive gun control legislation, including closing the gun show loophole, has demonstrated how the politics of guns has changed in recent years. Even several presidential cycles ago, Democrats largely believed it was harmful to be outspoken about gun control in a national election. Matt Bennett, co-founder of the centrist think tank Third Way who has done extensive work on gun control, said Kaine is uniquely positioned to help Clinton make a powerful case on an issue that the party is increasingly outspoken about. \u201cThere\u2019s no question it\u2019s an attractive part of his record, certainly for Democrats, so I think they\u2019ll try to make that case to the base of the electorate and I would argue they should make that case to swing voters, too,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe really handled a brutally difficult situation with dexterity and flexibility and great honesty, which are his hallmarks, and I think that\u2019s a great story to tell.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Clinton super PAC ads target Trump's comments about women Trump trolls Bill Clinton on past conduct Both sides prepare to raise hundreds of millions of dollars The ugly, multibillion-dollar general election campaign is here. The clash between Donald Trump and the forces supporting Hillary Clinton played out on Twitter and social media Tuesday, underscoring a certainty about the fall campaign \u2013 nothing will be off limits. In this case, it was Priorities USA Action, the well-funded super PAC supporting Clinton, which served as instigator to Trump\u2019s stream of insults for the former first couple. Megyn Kelly confronts Trump on his 'bimbo' tweets Seizing on Trump\u2019s low favorability ratings among women, Priorities unveiled a pair of ads aiming to use Trump\u2019s derogatory comments about women against him. The $6 million ad buy in four swing states does not launch until Wednesday, but the provocative spots spread quickly across social media during a week when Trump has continually been on the defensive about his past conduct toward women. Nightcap: Democratic disarray | Sign up In one ad that seemed to especially pique Trump, Priorities directed women on camera to mouth words used by Trump in past interviews and audio recordings \u2014 sizing up women\u2019s figures in crude terms, using expletives, and suggesting that if Ivanka Trump wasn\u2019t his daughter, he might date her. Trump parried back on Twitter that \u201cthe pathetic new hit ad\u201d had misrepresented his words, and chided Clinton and former President Bill Clinton for the attacks, not making a distinction between her campaign and the independent super PAC. \u201cAmazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history,\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to Bill Clinton\u2019s past indiscretions. Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history Bill Clinton deflects Donald Trump's accusation It was not the first time Trump has launched that kind of attack on Bill Clinton\u2019s personal conduct. While many political strategists believed the Clinton scandals of the 1990s would hold little sway with voters \u2013 and would be dismissed as old news \u2013 Trump has continually tried to steer the conversation back to the former President\u2019s conduct at that time. At one point \u2013 without citing any specific proof \u2013 he suggested that the former secretary of state had treated the women involved with her husband poorly. But the Clinton campaign has adopted a consistent tactic that they are expected to use throughout the fall campaign \u2013 refusing to engage with what they consider to be Trump\u2019s low-level trolling. Bill Clinton summed up that approach when asked whether he wanted to respond to Trump\u2019s taunts while campaigning in Puerto Rico Tuesday. \u201cNo. I think people are smart enough to figure this out without my help,\u201d the former President said. Clinton\u2019s official campaign has yet to respond to Trump\u2019s latest string of tweets; aides said it was unlikely they would. Clinton has made it clear that she does not intend to engage with Trump when he issues personal attacks - a strategy that many around her, including outside groups, viewed as a call for them to stay above the fray, too. Congresswoman: Trump will fix problem with women voters \u201cI am going to let him run his campaign however he chooses,\u201d Clinton told reporters earlier this month in Virginia, adding later, \u201cI have nothing to say about him and how he is running his campaign.\u201d Aides have said that Clinton\u2019s role in responding to Trump will be to critique his stances on policy issues and defend people an in speeches, including Muslims and Mexicans. Clinton\u2019s aides are aware that she can\u2019t be seen as shying away from a fight with Trump, but want to be sure that fight is on their terms. Opinion: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are made for each other Clinton surrogates have been told by campaign aides not to \u201cget into the mud\u201d with Trump - on Twitter or on television. The Kentucky primary on CNN in 60 seconds Bakari Sellers, another surrogate and CNN contributor, said there is \u201cno reason to get down on his level.\u201d \u201cThere is no need for Hillary Clinton to respond to a man who gets his news from the National Enquirer,\u201d Sellers added. \u201cDonald Trump is beneath her. Period.\u201d Though their new attack ads were pointed, Clinton\u2019s big money super PAC, Priorities USA, has also pledged not to get too personal. \u201cWe have said all along that we are not interested in going into his personal life and neither do we need to,\u201d said Justin Barasky, spokesman for the group that released their first ads against Trump this week. Clinton\u2019s campaign hopes to be able to hold this line for the campaign, but aides acknowledge that Trump - who has surrounded himself with agitators like Ed Klein, who has written discredited books about the Clintons, and Roger Stone, a GOP operative known to get negative and personal - could make that difficult. Opinion: Why Trump is a shocking GOP choice In a hint of the big-spending campaign to come, Trump and the Republican National Committee announced a joint fundraising agreement that was another sign of the renegade campaign coming together with the Republican establishment. While Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he was self-funding his campaign, the agreement announced with the RNC would allow donors to write checks of up to $449,400 in 11 states. The agreement will also allow Trump to repay himself the money he has loaned to his effort during the primary. Trump, RNC announce joint fundraising deal There is an acknowledgment among Democrats that someone will have to meet the Trump campaign where they are on personal attacks and many agree that David Brock, the founder of Media Matters for America and American Bridge 21st Century Super PAC, is the most likely person. Clinton\u2019s campaign, still maintaining some focus on Bernie Sanders and the primary campaign, has yet to begin fundraising in earnest for the general election. But donors who have already maxed out their contributions in primary dollars have told CNN and the campaign that they are prepared to donate once again when Clinton\u2019s operation switched from collecting primary dollars to general election money. Priorities USA has already begun pledging to spend millions of dollars on ads in the general election. So far the pro-Clinton super PAC has reserved $136 million in ad time and some Democrats expect the group to raise upwards of $500 million for the 2016 race. Clinton wins Kentucky, Sanders takes Oregon At the same time, Clinton has tried to show voters she is ready for the fight, making it clear that she is eager to debate Trump. She recently started telling audiences that she feels Americans take their vote seriously and, therefore, will pick the candidate with better ideas, not better insults. Recognizing the need not just to withstand Trump\u2019s attacks \u2013 but to seize the spotlight in this election \u2013 Clinton is now adding an extra flourish to her Trump attacks. During a two-day swing through Kentucky, Clinton began mocking the presumptive Republican nominee by taking on his distinctive New York accent and pretending like the two were in a debate together. \u201cI actually think it matters what you say you are going to do if you are running for president. Maybe he will get around to it, maybe he won\u2019t,\u201d Clinton said Monday in Kentucky. \u201cBut I am voting for placing my trust in the American people who are able to figure out who actually has your back when it comes to the economy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama is pushing Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination in local television interviews His administration is trying to pressure politically-vulnerable Republican senators The Senate may be in recess, but the White House and allied groups are working hard to keep the pressure on the chamber\u2019s Republicans to hold a hearing and a vote for the president\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court, Judge Merrick Garland. Obama appeared on several local TV stations Monday afternoon making the case for Garland. No surprise, they were in markets with vulnerable Senate Republicans who Democrats are trying to pressure to move on the nomination \u2013 or pay a steep electoral price. In Milwaukee, Obama\u2019s target was Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who has not yet sat down with Garland during the judge\u2019s meet-and-greet tour of the Senate. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is unprecedented which is the notion that you wouldn\u2019t meet with or provide a hearing or a vote for a nominee that everybody agrees is eminently qualified. I\u2019m glad that Senator Johnson now has finally agreed to meet with him but he says he\u2019s not gonna give him a vote before the election and yet you haven\u2019t heard a good reason for it,\u201d Obama said on WISN. In keeping with a theme the administration has pushed from the beginning of its drive to seat Garland on the highest court in the land, the president slammed Senate Republicans\u2019 inaction on a nominee that several have hailed as a qualified, consensus pick. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that says if you\u2019re in an election year the president shall not make a nomination,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt says the opposite \u2013 it says you shall and then it says the Senate shall advise and consent.\u201d Obama also sat with stations in Phoenix; Manchester, New Hampshire; Cincinnati; Kansas City, Missouri; and Des Moines, Iowa. While Garland has met with more than a dozen Senate Republicans, the campaign to persuade the GOP to hold hearings has stalled. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans argue that because it is an election year, the decision about who should replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the court should be left to the next president, which they say would allow American voters to have a say in the process. \u201cAs you have probably noticed, I have taken a good deal of hits over this. People say, do your job. Do your job. Well this is my job,\u201d McConnell said to raucous applause at the Kentucky state GOP convention in March. \u201cYou all didn\u2019t reelect me and my colleagues didn\u2019t reelect me leader, this time majority leader, to give Barack Obama the opportunity to turn the Supreme Court to the left. It ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d The president\u2019s television interviews coincide with a push underway by the progressive group Americans United for Change that is bringing mobile billboards to nine states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, Missouri and North Carolina \u2013 over nine days to push for confirmation of a ninth justice to the court. One of the billboards is outside the Sioux City, Iowa, office of Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley that reads \u201cTell Iowa\u2019s Senators: #DoYourJob. Fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court.\u201d The group\u2019s president, Brad Woodhouse, argued the DoYourJob effort resonates with an American public that is fed up with Congress and said the Republican Senate is showing \u201cblatant disrespect\u201d for Obama. \u201cThis is all political for them,\u201d Woodhouse said, referring to the opposition to Garland. \u201cWe\u2019re exclusively going after Republican senators who are up for re-election this year, because they\u2019ve made it clear that for them this is about politics.\u201d Conservative groups like Susan B. Anthony List have also been gearing up for the fight, putting together a coalition to support pro-life senators who want to block the nomination. The Judicial Crisis Network has spent some $4 million on efforts to block Garland\u2019s nomination, including a TV and digital campaign running in Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Dakota and West Virginia featuring a video that highlights what it calls Garland\u2019s liberal record, saying Garland would be \u201cthe tie-breaking vote for Obama\u2019s big government liberalism.\u201d The hope for Democrats is that increasing the pressure on GOP senators facing tough re-election fights \u2013 like Ohio\u2019s Rob Portman and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania \u2013 could lead to hearings and officials are confident Garland would impress viewers if given the chance to answer questions publicly. Garland, has served on the D.C. Circuit Court for 19 years, the past three years as chief judge. He has met with 46 senators, including 14 Republicans. Democrats jumped all over a WMUR poll of New Hampshire voters late last month that showed Ayotte\u2019s approval ratings taking a hit since the Supreme Court fight began, but Ayotte who is one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable GOP incumbents, was unmoved. She strongly disagreed with the poll\u2019s findings \u2013 and despite meeting with Garland, does not think his nomination should move forward. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the poll,\u201d Ayotte told CNN. \u201cThere are obviously people in my state who have different views on the Supreme Court issue. I think there were some underlying issues with the poll. But I think people in my state understand my position of allowing them to have a say in November and let the people weigh in. And I\u2019m looking forward to continuing to campaign in New Hampshire and I like who where we are.\u201d Asked if she were considering changing her position after meeting with Garland, Ayotte said flatly: \u201cNo. Grassley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and has said he would not hold hearings or a vote on the nomination, is a top target for groups that support Garland. Pro-Garland interest groups in Washington released a poll showing that many Iowa voters oppose Grassley\u2019s handling of the nomination and believe he is politically-motivated in blocking a vote.  Grassley, who is running for his seventh term, faces a potentially tough reelection race this fall. \u201cThis committee has turned into a rubber stamp for this Trump/McConnell situation that\u2019s going on in the Republican Party,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, on a conference call with reporters discussing the poll. \u201cRepublicans are in charge, they need to get things done, they need to stop complaining, move forward and do their jobs.\u201d The White House often notes that every Supreme Court nominee since 1875, who has not withdrawn from the process, has received a hearing or a vote and officials believe Republicans\u2019 political standing is suffering as a result of the position they have taken on the nomination. Press Secretary Josh Earnest linked the inaction on Garland\u2019s nomination to the lack of movement on emergency funding to combat the mosquito-borne Zika virus and on considering restructuring authority for Puerto Rico, which faces a financial crisis, and the inability to pass a budget, painting the Republican-controlled Congress as ineffective on several fronts. \u201cI think it is clear that they are stalling, that they aren\u2019t doing their jobs, and they\u2019re hoping that no one will notice.  I think, unfortunately, they\u2019re going to be wrong about that,\u201d Earnest said Friday. Recent polls indicate some support for the administration\u2019s view. A March CNN survey found nearly two-thirds (64%) of voters want the Senate to hold hearings on Garland\u2019s nomination and 52% say he should be confirmed. Still, several polls have also shown the court is not a top-tier issue for most voters and since it fires up the GOP base as much as the Democratic base, many Republicans believe the issue to be a wash.

            "article_content": "Republican Party elders are begrudgingly coming to grips with what once was unthinkable: Choosing between Ted Cruz or Donald Trump as their party's nominee Cruz allies say it's best to have a true conservative at the top, even if they don't like him much But some senators say Trump is doing a better job expanding the GOP electorate In the bowels of the Capitol and over meals with high-powered donors, Republican Party elders are begrudgingly coming to grips with what once was unthinkable: Choosing between Ted Cruz or Donald Trump as their party\u2019s nominee. With the two remaining establishment favorites Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich needing to both win their home states in order to survive and factor in a contested convention, Cruz and Trump could soon be the only choices left in the bitter GOP battle. Two dominant lines of thinking are emerging, according to a wide range of interviews with more than a dozen senior party leaders. On one side: The likes of Sen. Lindsey Graham, a former presidential candidate is now leading the pro-Cruz charge, arguing that having a life-long Republican with extreme message discipline at the top of the ticket will be less harmful than the highly unpredictable and brash Trump. That feeling persists even if Cruz is hated by many his fellow GOP senators. Yet for all the worries about Trump bringing down the GOP or losing a general election, a surprisingly large number of Republican senators are open to backing Trump. The billionaire businessman would dramatically boost turnout and help Republicans down-ballot, they say, pointing in particular to incumbent senators\u2019 resounding primary victories in Alabama and Arkansas earlier this month. \u201cI have no problem running with him,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr, who is up for reelection in North Carolina, said of Trump. During closed-door GOP Conference lunches, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear that his sole focus is keeping the majority, pointing to 1996, when Republicans gained two Senate seats despite Bob Dole\u2019s big loss to Bill Clinton, according to several senators. McConnell has made a similar case during meetings with donors, according to attendees. But when the discussion turns to the Trump vs. Cruz issue, there\u2019s no clear consensus on who would be best for their party. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion,\u201d said one senior senator, who asked for anonymity to discuss private deliberations. From their point-of-view, it\u2019s not an easy choice: A divisive billionaire with inflammatory rhetoric or an ideologically rigid bomb-thrower who has labeled most of them as patently corrupt \u2013 all in an election year when every House seat is in contention and Republicans are in serious risk of losing their 54-46 Senate majority. A large number of senators say having Cruz at the top of the ticket would actually be beneficial for this reason: If he lost a general election, it would send a clear message to the GOP\u2019s increasingly powerful tea party wing that ideological purity doesn\u2019t sell to mainstream voters in swing states, effectively giving new power to more moderate voices in the party. But many are equally worried about Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric that could turn off key voting blocs like Hispanics and suburban women, believing that would do lasting harm to the Republican Party. Asked if he was worried about Trump or Cruz at the top of the ticket, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who has endorsed Rubio, answered succinctly. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be a disaster for us,\u201d Flake said of Trump, warning Democrats would have a chance of winning his red state and bringing out droves of Latino voters with Trump as the nominee. On Cruz, he added: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that we need to expand the Republican Party,\u201d suggesting that the staunchly conservative Cruz wouldn\u2019t be able to do so. With Republican turnout growing this year in primary and caucus states, some GOP senators believe that Trump\u2019s ability to woo disaffected Democrats and independents would help bring new voters to the polls that would ultimately help their party down the ticket. Trump has made that point himself. \u201cLook, we have expanded the Republican Party,\u201d he said, celebrating his March 1 victories on Super Tuesday. \u201cThey came from the Democratic Party, or the Democrat Party, and they\u2019re Democrats and they\u2019re long-time Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched. And they were independents.\u201d Two recent examples support this argument. In Alabama this month, long-time Sen. Richard Shelby romped to a 37-point victory in his primary, even though some Republicans in Washington were fretting that the veteran senator would be caught by a tea party uprising. Similarly, Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas was the beneficiary of an influx of new voters in the GOP primary, far outpacing Democrats, something that surprised him because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s long-standing ties to his state. \u201cI think one thing we are seeing in many states is a lot more voter turnout,\u201d Boozman said Wednesday. \u201cWe had about twice as many people choosing Republicans versus the Democratic primary.\u201d \u201cThere are folks who have said you\u2019d lose the Senate if Trump were the nominee,\u201d said Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, who is neutral in the primary. \u201cWell? Sen. Shelby in Alabama just won overwhelmingly, where Trump won overwhelmingly.\u201d Moreover, Trump is a newcomer to the GOP \u2013 and doesn\u2019t have the bitter relationship that Cruz has with most his colleagues. And many aren\u2019t willing yet to warm up to their adversarial colleague. \u201cWhen he makes a statement and says there\u2019s no difference between the Democrat Party and the Republican Party \u2026 that\u2019s very damaging to the Republican Party,\u201d Sen. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma conservative who backs Rubio, said of Cruz. Despite Cruz\u2019s bitter relationships, stemming from two years of acrimonious fighting over tactics and strategy with McConnell and other GOP leaders, a number of Republican senators say they\u2019d rather see Cruz than Trump, even if they don\u2019t think he has much of a chance of winning. Having a conservative atop the party, they argue, would not do nearly as much harm as nominating Trump, whose policy positions are unclear and has held some views that conflict with bedrock Republican principles. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s time to support the nominee,\u201d said Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, a Rubio backer. \u201cI\u2019m certainly hoping this is somebody other than Trump at this point.\u201d Graham said he prefers Kasich or Rubio but would choose Cruz over Trump, whom he views as an \u201cinterloper\u201d to the GOP. \u201cDonald Trump was able to impress David Duke to the point where David Duke said, \u2018I could support that guy,\u2019\u201d Graham said of the former KKK grand wizard. \u201cI think it\u2019s a huge mistake for Republicans to nominate someone who could impress David Duke because if you can do that, you\u2019re not going to grow this party. \u201c Yet, Graham flatly acknowledged the challenges Cruz has in winning over Senate Republicans, whom the Texas Republican has dubbed as part of the \u201cWashington cartel\u201d and regularly attacks on the campaign trail. \u201cSen. Cruz has made it very difficult to work with him here,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to deal with that. He\u2019s going to have repair some of that damage. All of us are going to need to have an open mind too.\u201d",

The email, signed by 2016 Committee National Chairman John Philip Sousa IV, said that the race is still \u201cin flux\u201d but if Carson isn\u2019t on the ticket, \u201cThe Democrats will win the White House and the America we love will disappear.\u201d Sousa said front-runner Donald Trump and Sens.

He added that\u2019s why it was important to keep Carson, who is languishing at the bottom of polls and delegate count, in the campaign. \u201cThe demographics of America have changed dramatically, and that is why Ben Carson must stay in this race,\u201d Sousa wrote. \u201cHe may not win the GOP nomination, but he still holds the winning hand in this political poker game.

Larry Ross, the campaign\u2019s communication director said in a statement. \u201cHe is committed to pressing on with his campaign as long as he continues to receive donations and support from \u2018We the People.\u2019 \u201c Carson raised eyebrows Tuesday when he said President Barack Obama was \u201craised white\u201d and that his own election to the White House would mark a significant step for African-Americans. \u201cLike most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but I also recognize that his experience and my experience are night-and-day different. He didn\u2019t grow up like I grew up by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Carson told POLITICO this week. \u201cHe\u2019s an \u2018African\u2019 American. He was, you know, raised white.\u201d Carson on Obama: Same skin color, different experiences The pro-Carson super PAC has also had its share of problems, including a mass defection of its staffers in New Hampshire to Cruz\u2019s rival campaign ahead of the primary there. That exodus included the group\u2019s executive director. Sousa told CNN, however, that the staff departures were minor and that the executive director, Sam Pimm, was asked to leave. \u201cThey were very, very low-level intern types that had zero impact on what we were doing,\u201d Sousa said of the staffers. \u201cAnd in terms of the executive director, we fired him, because he was worthless.\u201d Reached for comment, Pimm said he resigned. \u201cI tendered my resignation due to disagreements over personnel,\u201d Pimm said. Pimm also questioned Thursday\u2019s fundraising email, saying Carson staying in the race only benefits Trump. He added he hadn\u2019t seen any polling that Carson was the leading choice for vice president. \u201cThe idea that a Republican cannot win the White House without Ben Carson on the ticket is \u2026 just plain crazy,\u201d Pimm said in an email. Carson has four delegates in the Republican presidential primary compared with Trump\u2019s 82. He finished fourth out of five candidates in the Nevada caucuses with 4.8% of the vote.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders is declining to join calls for Hillary Clinton to release transcripts from her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other big banks, despite mounting pressure from progressives for the Democratic front-runner to do so In a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, the Vermont senator also ripped a key Clinton surrogate, predicted a close race in New Hampshire's upcoming primary and even exuded confidence that he will do well in South Carolina The war over Wall Street between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton escalated Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d where both candidates defended their records. Clinton repeated her accusation that Sanders and his campaign are engaged in an \u201cartistic smear\u201d by using innuendo against her. Sanders, for his part, declined to join calls \u2013 including from his own spokeswoman \u2013 for Clinton to release transcripts of her paid speeches to big banks, but he didn\u2019t reject those calls either. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Clinton about the implication from the Sanders campaign that Clinton changed her vote on a bankruptcy bill fifteen years ago as a senator. Earlier in the week, the Sanders campaign had forwarded to reporters comments and writings by Elizabeth Warren, the consumer advocate who is now a senator from Massachusetts. Warren has said that Clinton had agreed with opposing the bankruptcy provision as first lady, but ultimately voted for it years later as a senator. The accusations by Warren that she changed her vote are not new. CNN wrote about them in 2014. They also featured in the 2008 presidential campaign, when Clinton said she regretted the vote. Related: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s unvarnished view of Hillary Clinton in 2014 Clinton told Tapper she voted for  the bill she didn\u2019t like in 2001 as part of a deal to strike a provision about child support she said would hurt women and children. That\u2019s the way Congress works, Clinton said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it happens sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the bill any more than I had liked it before. It still had very bad provisions. But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children. So, okay. I held my nose, I voted for it. It never became law.\u201d Clinton bristled at the implication, however. \u201cThis attack by insinuation, by innuendo, is really getting old,\u201d she said, arguing the Sanders campaign is \u201cgrasping at straws\u201d to make the case she is beholden to Wall Street. Clinton said she has a tougher plan to take on Wall Street than he does and she\u2019d rather debate those issues. Earlier this week, Sanders criticized his opponent over her ties to Wall Street at MSNBC\u2019s Democratic debate. \u201cWhat being part of the establishment is, is in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one\u2019s life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests,\u201d Sanders said Thursday. Sanders, meanwhile, declined to to join calls for Clinton to release transcripts from her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other big banks, despite mounting pressure from progressives for the Democratic front-runner to do so. The Vermont senator also ripped a key Clinton surrogate, predicted a close race in New Hampshire\u2019s upcoming primary and even exuded confidence that he will do well in South Carolina. \u201cDo you think she should (release the transcripts), and what do you think would be revealed in those transcripts?\u201d Tapper asked Sanders. \u201cNo idea,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI have no idea what she said and I think the decision as to whether or not to release it is her decision.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have a position on it at all?\u201d Tapper asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the Vermont senator said. RELATED: Despite big lead, Sanders predicts close race in New Hampshire When asked at the debate whether she would release the transcripts, Clinton simply said she would \u201clook into it.\u201d But progressive activists, as well as some Republicans, have put pressure on Clinton over her paid speeches, with some calling on her to release the transcripts. And Symone Sanders, a spokesman for the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign, called for the transcripts to be released before Tuesday\u2019s primary. \u201cI think that is a question that is going to live on further, even after this debate is over, and it\u2019s a question that deserves to be answered,\u201d she said. A CNN analysis found Clinton collected at least $1.8 million for at least eight speeches to big banks, including Goldman Sachs and UBS, from the time after her husband, former President Bill Clinton, left the White House until she announced her presidential campaign last spring. Sanders, however, did not hold back when Tapper asked him about David Brock, the man who runs the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA. \u201cI happen to like Hillary Clinton, but I am astounded by some of the people that she has hired, including David Brock,\u201d Sanders said, questioning his opponent\u2019s judgment. Brock is a recovering \u201cright-wing attack man\u201d and lead a crusade against the Clintons in the 1990s. Now, however, he is a major Clinton backer and has regularly targeted Sanders. Among other attacks, Brock recently said that a Sanders TV ad didn\u2019t feature enough African-American and Latino faces and claimed \u201cBlack lives don\u2019t matter much to Bernie Sanders.\u201d \u201cDavid Brock, people will remember, used to be a real right-wing guy who was attacking people like Anita Hill,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThis is an African-American law professor who tried to do the right thing, and he admitted it. He said, \u2018I lied about her.\u2019\u201d Sanders added, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand where the Clinton people are coming from hiring somebody like that. Every day, you know, they\u2019re attacking us in one way or the other.\u201d Sanders did have a 2-to-1 edge in the latest CNN/WMUR New Hampshire tracking poll as recently as Saturday, but that margin narrowed slightly in a poll out Sunday. The Vermont senator believes Tuesday\u2019s primary will be a close one. \u201cWe think it\u2019s gonna be a close election, we\u2019re working really hard,\u201d Sanders told Tapper. It\u2019s a sentiment Sanders has echoed for the past five days in the Granite State. Bernie Sanders predicts a close race in New Hampshire \u201cDon\u2019t make me nervous, and don\u2019t jinx me,\u201d he added. Both Democratic campaigns have tried to manage expectations for the primary. Clinton has pushed the narrative that Sanders hails from Vermont and thus has an edge with his New England neighbors. In turn, Sanders reminded voters that Clinton won the state in the 2008 primary when she ran against then-Sen. Barack Obama. The Sanders campaign has said it\u2019s insulting to New Hampshire voters to suggest that they would only support him because he\u2019s from the New England area. \u201cWell, in this sense it is. Look, I mean, obviously, Vermont and New Hampshire are separated by a river, we are close states,\u201d he told Tapper. \u201cBut you know what? Secretary Clinton won this state in 2008. Her husband ran several campaigns in this state. When we began this campaign here in New Hampshire, we were 30 points down in the polls and she was much better known in this state than I was.\u201d Earlier in the week, Sanders reiterated the same line, telling reporters on Tuesday that Clinton \u201chas very significant political connections.\u201d \u201cShe has the support of virtually the entire political establishment here in New Hampshire,\u201d he added. But although Sanders says he\u2019s focused on not letting New Hampshire slip away, he believes his campaign will be viable in South Carolina, a state where Clinton is considered to have a significant advantage. \u201cI think we are the underdog now,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI think we have seen some real momentum there. I think we got a shot at it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A larger turnout should help Bernie Sanders if he can convince first-time caucus-goers to show up Clinton's campaign had 30 paid staffers in Iowa last spring and by August, had at least one supporter in each of Iowa's 1,681 precincts With just a couple of tables, a stack of boxes and some Bernie Sanders posters tacked to the wall filling their one big, empty room, there\u2019s no doubt: This crew looks like the underdogs. Three volunteers \u2013 all getting involved in a political campaign for the first time \u2013 and a young staffer named Charlie Dominick are trying to harness the momentum of a surprise, last-minute surge a few days after Sanders had come to town. \u201cYou can definitely tell \u2013 people are getting excited. People that didn\u2019t want to volunteer before are ready to start now,\u201d said Emma Schmidt, 21, of rural Calhoun County who administers three pro-Sanders Facebook pages and hosts speech and debate watch parties \u2013 but has never caucused before. In Iowa, it actually does all come down to turnout. A larger turnout should favor Sanders, who is banking on bringing younger voters who haven\u2019t participated before in presidential elections to the caucuses. Smaller turnout will likely favor Hillary Clinton, who has concentrated on the more traditional, committed Democratic audience. How those two campaigns are able to get their backers to show up Monday will play the key role in determining how far the Democratic primary goes In 2004, about 124,000 people showed up \u2013 with that year\u2019s liberal insurgent, Howard Dean, particularly let down by the turnout, losing to John Kerry and never recovering. Four years later, in 2008, an intense three-way race and Barack Obama\u2019s vaunted field operation nearly doubled that number, to 239,000 participants. Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton fight to claim Obama\u2019s legacy No one \u2013 not even Sanders himself \u2013 is forecasting turnout that high again. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think we can\u201d match 2008, he said Monday. But Sanders\u2019 overwhelming advantage in polls among young people and first-time caucus-goers makes clear that the more people who participate, the better he\u2019ll do. Clinton\u2019s campaign, however, is way ahead of the organization game. Her hyper-organized campaign manager Robby Mook dispatched 30 paid staffers to Iowa last spring while Sanders was still little more than a protest candidate. By August, Clinton\u2019s campaign had at least one supporter in each of Iowa\u2019s 1,681 precincts. The jump-start in recruiting an army of volunteers and \u201cprecinct captains\u201d meant Clinton\u2019s campaign could more quickly identify her supporters, make personal contacts, deliver door-hangers and help her backers find their caucus sites. That\u2019s all particularly important in Iowa, where caucusing can be a three-hour, public affair that pits friends and neighbors against each other. \u201cIt takes a lot of time and energy to get these people really engaged,\u201d said Norm Sterzenbach, a strategist at GPS Impact and former Iowa Democratic Party executive director. \u201cYou need local volunteers to help you do this. You need Iowans to help explain this strategy and get people to do this.\u201d Just three blocks east from Sanders\u2019 office here in Western Iowa, Clinton\u2019s storefront shop is humming. A dozen volunteers, including two coordinators, and local organizer Kate Magill are there. The walls are decorated with schedules, pro-Clinton talking points and posters signed by Clinton\u2019s famous surrogates. Tina Ward-Pugh, a 16-year member of Louisville, Kentucky\u2019s council, is back in Iowa to \u201cfinish what we started eight years ago.\u201d They\u2019re part of a Clinton operation that has already finished two January test runs of their caucus-day plans and their get-out-the-vote operation, which will unleash thousands of volunteers departing from more than 150 locations. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Most of them watched Clinton lose eight years ago, and they say her organization now matches the Barack Obama operation that beat her in 2008. Still, there\u2019s a sense of anxiety over whether Sanders can pull in voters who aren\u2019t even on their radar. Jean Guy, a 65-year-old Catholic high school teacher in town, said it\u2019s hard to dispute Sanders has \u201ccaught fire.\u201d \u201cWho would disagree with anything Bernie says?\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, great \u2013 I want all that, too. And I would also, while we\u2019re at it, like two weeks guaranteed at Disney World every year.\u201d For the final days before Monday night\u2019s caucuses, they\u2019ll mostly drop their attempts to find potential caucus-goers and persuade them. Instead, they will enter full get-out-the-caucus mode \u2013 dispatching herds of volunteers to knock on doors, deliver door-hangers and find ways to drive people to their local precincts if they can\u2019t drive themselves. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders take different roads in Iowa in search of delegates Sanders has drastically expanded his Iowa operation in December and January as his poll numbers \u2013 and online donations \u2013 surged. He\u2019s nearly matched Clinton now on the ground. She has 26 organizational offices with paid staffers throughout Iowa; he has 23 \u2013 even if they\u2019re hastily opened and sparsely decorated. \u201cThe Sanders campaign was really still building the plane as they were flying it, but to their credit they have built an impressive organization given the time they had to build it,\u201d said Brad Anderson, a Democratic strategist who led President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election effort in Iowa in 2012. Bernie Sanders' political career Tom Clark, a 60-year-old county maintenance worker in Maple River, had never considered volunteering for a politician until he heard Sanders on a local radio show. \u201cI was one of these guys that maybe just let it go, didn\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018God, nobody\u2019s talking about this my whole life, and this guy\u2019s talking about it.\u2019 It inspired me.\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign got a late start in harnessing the thousands of people who show up at his events. Now, though, his camp carries iPads and asks attendees to register electronically. It allows them to skip the data entry and quickly follow up with people \u2013 especially potential first-time caucus-goers \u2013 who only show up in the campaign\u2019s final days. Susan Sarandon stumps for Bernie Sanders in Iowa Sanders himself offered a blunt assessment of his Iowa operation after a meeting with steelworkers in Des Moines on Monday. \u201cWe started out organizing in Iowa a lot later than Senator Clinton did. She was here in 2008; has the experience we didn\u2019t have. She\u2019s done this before, we didn\u2019t. She has a very strong organization. And I applaud her for that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will tell you that the last couple of months we have gained a whole lot of ground and again I think we stand a real chance to create a large voter turnout.\u201d The makeup of his support \u2013 young and new to the process \u2013 means his challenge is doubly difficult: Not only has Sanders had to race to build a competitive field organization in two months; his organizers and volunteers must try to reach a much larger universe of potential supporters than Clinton\u2019s operation is targeting. \u201cOn the Sanders campaign, they\u2019re obviously focused on turning out their supporters, but I\u2019m pretty confident they\u2019re also banking on a wave of new, additional supporters \u2013 engaged, watching, wanting to participate, but not on their radar screen,\u201d Anderson said. Sanders tries to bolster position against gun law he previously supported One major unknown that has Iowa Democrats buzzing is the race\u2019s third candidate: former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. Under Democratic caucus rules, candidates have to reach 15% support in a precinct to be considered \u201cviable\u201d and eligible to win any delegates. Supporters of candidates who fall short, though, get the choice to realign behind another contender. O\u2019Malley\u2019s support is small, but those who are backing him tend to be committed caucus-goers who understand the process, would never skip it and know how to cut deals. If the race is a nail-biter, they could make a difference \u2013 particularly in precincts with odd numbers of delegates at play \u2013 11, rather than 10, for example \u2013 because they could tip what looks like a tie into a victory for either Clinton or Sanders. O\u2019Malley backers say they\u2019re hearing from both campaigns \u2013 each cribbing Obama\u2019s 2008 strategy of trying to become the second choice of voters who started in the camps of the lowest-polling candidates. Several Democratic strategists said they expect O\u2019Malley\u2019s supporters to split about 60/40 in Sanders\u2019 favor. The campaigns are telegraphing their strategies to turn out votes through where the candidates themselves are spending time. Each of Iowa\u2019s 1,681 precincts has delegates to win \u2013 and the caucus results are based on who nets the most delegates, not who gets the most overall supporters. Clinton\u2019s events have been concentrated in delegate-rich urban and suburban areas \u2013 particularly those she lost in 2008. Winning those areas, or even keeping them close so Sanders can\u2019t run up a big lead, could be the difference. Sanders, meanwhile, has hit college towns and typically unvisited portions of Iowa\u2019s cities \u2013 but he has also spent more time in rural areas where Clinton could fare well. Keeping her from running up an insurmountable lead in those areas could give him a win. Iowa strategists said Clinton\u2019s schedule has been particularly shrewd, while Sanders\u2019 reflects a candidate intent on broadening his appeal. \u201cI think it makes a ton of sense to go to those areas where you need turnout to really be high and clearly the schedule reflects that on the Clinton side,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cHe really has been focused on the college towns, which seems to be a strategic move. \u2026 But getting college students to caucus is a really, really heavy lift.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz is facing a whisper campaign of sorts in Iowa questioning the extent of his evangelical Christian beliefs Cruz is the leader in Iowa and faces attacks from Donald Trump, Ben Carson and others over the next four weeks Ted Cruz\u2019s six-day bus trip in Iowa launched as more of religious revival tour than a presidential barnstorm. In the most conservative parts of the state on Monday, the Texas senator weaved in faith at every turn, soliciting shouts of \u201cAmen\u201d and prayers from the audience. In Carroll, he asked the audience to \u201cpray and ask God to continue this awakening.\u201d At a Christian bookstore in Boone, he quoted from the Book of Joshua. \u201cI was seeing Joshua 24:15 on the wall: \u2018choose you this day whom you will serve; as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd what a powerful reminder of the values that Washington, D.C., seems to have forgotten. What a powerful reminder of the values that built this country.\u201d But despite his outward displays of his belief, Cruz, the favorite in Iowa, is facing a whisper campaign of sorts from his Republican opponents: He\u2019s Christian, but not Christian enough. Donald Trump has cryptically questioned whether Cuba raises true evangelicals, pondering aloud whether Cruz is actually a Catholic. Ben Carson\u2019s closest aide has argued that Cruz\u2019s faith isn\u2019t as native to him as Carson\u2019s is to him. And a pair of back-of-the-pack contenders, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, charge that Cruz is prioritizing wrong-headed Constitutional commitments over long-held Christian ones. Read: A day in the life on the campaign trail The attacks on the new Iowa frontrunner are just beginning. Their dark religious overtone is not subtle \u2013 and they could define the final four-week push to dethrone him from the top of the evangelical heap. Cruz, who attends a Southern Baptist church and paces a stage like one of its preachers, has wooed the leaders of the evangelical grassroots for eight months, a courtship that is paying off this winter as he wins a string of high-profile endorsements. These growing victories also seem to have energized a batch of spurned rivals, some of whom have few cards left to play other than ripping the Iowa leader as a two-faced impostor with more political cunning than deep religious sincerity. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to question his religious integrity,\u201d said evangelical leader Rob Schenck, who deemed those blows \u201cnot helpful to the process.\u201d But Schenck acknowledged the politics at play: \u201cYes, it could definitely be damaging.\u201d The Christian rebuke is just one of many critiques leveled now at the GOP\u2019s target du jour in Iowa. Santorum\u2019s campaign on Monday became the sixth group in recent weeks to spend money against Cruz in Iowa with a new television advertisement. Other groups promise more to come. Cruz, for his part, sees these attacks as a validation that he is a threat to win the nomination. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m looking at the materials some of y\u2019all might\u2019ve seen. \u2018Ted Cruz is dangerous,\u2019\u201d he said, reading from a mailer on Monday afternoon given to attendees in Carroll by a pro-ethanol group. \u201cYou know what, to the Washington cartel, to the career politicians that are getting fat and happy and want the gravy train to keep going, that\u2019s exactly right.\u201d Moments from Ted Cruz's career And as he rides his bus throughout the state, he re-pitched himself to the state\u2019s Christians, released a soft, direct-to-camera television ad in Iowa in which he promised to not \u201ccompromise the values that make us who we are.\u201d But on the ground, there are some signs that questions about Cruz\u2019s commitment to the evangelical movement are breaking through. After his event in Carroll, Lea Hoffman approached Cruz and shared her concern about an audio tape (from a Cruz fundraiser in New York City) she had heard in an advertisement by Mike Huckabee\u2019s super PAC which used it to portray Cruz as deemphasizing traditional marriage. Hoffman told Cruz his son would vote for Rubio \u201cbecause you are for gay rights.\u201d Cruz, ridiculing the \u201csecret tape\u201d as not-so-revealing, said he had a better record than Rubio on same-sex marriage. Hoffman later appeared convinced, telling CNN: \u201cHe lines up with what I believe the way the Lord wants this.\u201d Cruz\u2019s consistent line has been that marriage is to be decided by the states. But that doubts are being stirred with like Hoffman is music to the ears of the Cruz rivals who charge that he is more corporate than Christian. \u201cIf Senator Cruz is an advocate for states\u2019 rights on marriage and on life, then I think would surprise a lot of evangelicals,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for Huckabee, who supports constitutional amendments that would define marriage as being between a man and a woman. \u201cTed Cruz is just like any other politician. He says one thing in Manhattan, he says another thing in Iowa,\u201d Carly Fiorina said Sunday to CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Read: Fiorina: Cruz says \u2018whatever\u2019 to get elected Other candidates have uncorked more biting remarks that speak to Cruz\u2019s own personal life. After a period of peace between Cruz and Trump, the New York businessman last week once again implored Iowans to \u201cjust remember\u201d that \u201cnot a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba.\u201d Trump suggested this weekend that it was possible Cruz, whose father was born there, is natively Catholic. \u201cCuba, generally speaking, is a Catholic country. And you don\u2019t equate evangelicals with Cuba. I don\u2019t,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Even Ben Carson, who has been averse to much of the hand-to-hand combat that now defines the GOP race, has gotten involved: His business adviser and often-spokesman, Armstrong Williams, said on CNN on Thursday that Cruz, like Trump, was not an \u201cauthentic\u201d evangelical Christian. \u201cThere are a lot of people who talk a good game about their faith, including Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDr. Carson lives it.\u201d Read: Shakeup in Ben Carson campaign as campaign manager, other top aides quit Cruz allies say they are not worried about the attacks, no matter the realm. They maintain he has the political skill \u2013 and as of this weekend, the television time \u2013 to hold his lead in Iowa, even as he fights a battle against six outside groups and a dozen other GOP candidates. Allies placed $2 million in television advertisements  in Iowa, thanks to a pair of super PACs \u2013 Keep the Promise and Stand for Truth \u2013 making their first big plays on television. Details about the plans Stand for Truth, a mysterious new $4 million group formed independently from Keep the Promise but still blessed by Cruz\u2019s big money network, were held close to the vest by group operatives on Monday. But on the question of faith, the candidate\u2019s defenders project confidence that his reputation will not be impugned. \u201cThey don\u2019t think he\u2019s putting on a front just for an election,\u201d said Tim Ried, an Iowa pastor supporting Cruz who is in touch with many other evangelical leaders in the state. \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is what he is, and he\u2019s lived that way for years before he started running.\u201d In Winterset on Monday evening, Cruz spoke of the emotion of his own family\u2019s faith, especially given the rigors of the presidential campaign \u2013 revealing that he and his wife spent 30 minutes on the phone Sunday night in prayer with senior staff. \u201cOur prayer has never been, \u2018We are seeking the hand of God,\u2019\u201d Cruz said of the prayer with his wife, Heidi. \u201cWe haven\u2019t asked God give us your help in winning this race. That is not our prayer. We are not seeking his hand. Her prayer was, \u2018Let us seek your face. Let this campaign reflect your love, reflect your glory and let your will be done.\u2019\u201d And at the end of each of event, he had three asks for Iowa voters: to caucus for him, to sign up to volunteer and persuade others, and to pray and ask God to continue the awakening. In Guthrie Center, he prayed: \u201cI will hear their prayers and forgive their sins and I will heal their land; that is the promise we are standing on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bush has a little more than a month to pull himself ahead of the crowded field of Republicans Bush is one of several Republican candidates in New Hampshire this week Jeb Bush on Tuesday kicked off his first trip of the year in New Hampshire, resuming his quest to make an epic comeback and relying heavily on the first-in-the-nation primary state to get him there. Bush has a little more than a month to pull himself ahead of the crowded field of Republicans vying for a top spot in the state\u2019s important contest on February 9. In the front of that race is Donald Trump, and Bush has ramped up his strategy to become the anti-Trump candidate in hopes that voters who feel disenfranchised by the front-runner will coalesce around Bush instead. \u201cIf you\u2019re a disabled person, it\u2019s not very funny when you get disparaged by the leading candidate in the Republican Party. Or if you\u2019re a woman and you get disparaged, it\u2019s not funny at all,\u201d Bush told a small audience at a town hall in Derry on Tuesday morning. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for some guy like that, I\u2019m not your guy.\u201d Bush is one of several Republican candidates in New Hampshire this week. Many of them, including Bush, will attend a forum combating drug addiction and the heroin epidemic. But the dominating topic of the day is guns, as President Barack Obama rolls out his new executive actions aimed to curb gun violence. In recent interviews, op-eds and campaign videos, Bush has been adamant in his support for Second Amendment rights and opposition to Obama\u2019s new policies. At his town hall, he blasted Obama for bypassing Congress, saying he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the authority to do it\u201d and argued that efforts to close the so-called gun show loop hole won\u2019t \u201csolve any problems.\u201d 'Inside Politics' Forecast Bush noticeably omitted one of his talking points about gun rights, in which he regularly tells a story about Charlton Heston awarding him a rifle after becoming NRA \u201cStatesman of the Year\u201d in 2003. After months of Bush telling that story, the campaign admitted Monday that the story wasn\u2019t accurate, saying Bush was \u201cmistaken\u201d and had \u201cconflated\u201d other stories. Still, Bush touted Tuesday his record of cracking down on gun violence as governor of Florida, mostly through the \u201c10-20-Life\u201d law, which issues a minimum 10-year sentence for anyone who pulls a gun while committing a crime, 20 years for pulling the trigger during a crime and 25 years to life for injuring or killing someone by firing a gun. But Bush got some pushback when a woman in the audience interrupted him to say, \u201cTrayvon Martin would disagree.\u201d \u201cThe simple fact is gun violence has declined about 30% when we imposed severe penalties for people committing crimes with guns,\u201d Bush responded, as the woman shook her head. \u201cAnd we are a pro-Second Amendment state. And I\u2019m totally proud of that.\u201d Manchester resident Mike Whitten had a different opinion of Bush. After the town hall, he approached the candidate to tell him that he was torn between Bush and Marco Rubio, but has now decided to vote for Bush. Whitten said he was impressed with the \u201csubstance\u201d behind Bush\u2019s answers at the town hall and his record as governor. \u201cHe really showed that he cared about one-on-one interaction with voters,\u201d he added. It\u2019s that kind of in-person appeal that Bush and his advisers hope will propel him in the coming weeks as voters start making their final decisions. One potential strategy could be bringing out Bush\u2019s brother, former President George W. Bush, as a surrogate. The former president\u2019s popularity has soared in recent years, with a Bloomberg Politics poll in November finding that 77% of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters had a favorable opinion of the former president. \u201cIt is something to consider because he is very popular,\u201d Jeb Bush said Tuesday morning on Fox News. \u201cI also know I need to go earn this.\u201d The concern about bringing the former president out on the trail may be more about its implications for the future, should Bush go on to the general election. It\u2019s a worry that Mitt Romney brought up in a recent interview with the Washington Post, saying \u201cI like Jeb a lot, I think he\u2019d be a great president, but felt he was unfairly but severely burdened by the W. years.\u201d Romney said he told Bush as much when the two met privately early last year. Asked on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d if Bush agreed that his candidacy could be hampered by his brother\u2019s legacy, the Republican candidate said \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d \u201cAny mistakes I make, they\u2019re my own,\u201d he added. \u201cMy brother and my family, I\u2019m honored to be part of that family. I love them dearly. And all the psycho-babble that goes along with it, I\u2019ve gotten over it.\u201d Bush was pressed further on whether he thinks the 43rd president should be condemning Trump publicly just as much as he is. \u201cI think that\u2019s my job,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou got to take on the bully head on and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d CNN\u2019s Athena Jones contributed to this report.",

He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d He also is the co-host of the podcast \u201cPolitics & Polls.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Julian Zelizer: For all that we know, there are still many mysteries about the 2016 election To find out why we now have President-elect Trump, we should be asking ourselves five main questions, he says When historians look back at the 2016 election, there will likely be many big mysteries to solve. More than many other election in recent history, this heated contest included a number of bizarre game-changing moments that seemed to swing the race in dramatic new directions. And weeks after the election\u2019s surprising outcome, people are still debating what produced the result. Even as the initial accounts emerge about these turbulent months, we still don\u2019t know the real story behind a number of pivotal moments that led to the election of Donald Trump. Here are some of them: She was attacked by Donald Trump on Twitter There were two moments when Trump\u2019s private life moved front and center in the campaign, posing a serious threat to his candidacy. One was the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes revealing him making degrading comments about women and suggesting a proclivity to sexual assault, and the other was when the New York Times finally obtained a partial copy of an older tax return showing that he had claimed a tax loss, which helped him avoid paying many millions in taxes on his income. In both cases the revelations swung the news cycle and forced the Trump campaign into a defensive crouch. They exposed two huge vulnerabilities of his candidacy, his treatment of women and his cheapness and refusal to fulfill obligations. In each case, Trump was able to survive the scandals by shifting attention to other issues and spinning the stories in a way that fit his anti-establishment narrative. But the questions remain: Who leaked the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tapes, and who sent the tax returns to the Times? One of the most troubling allegations to surface during the final months of the campaign was that members of the Trump team were coordinating with officials and hackers in Russia who were trying to sway the election. There is now an abundance of evidence that Russians engaged in a series of dirty tricks, from hacks into the Democratic National Committee emails that revealed embarrassing information to the distribution of fake news that spread vast amounts of false information to the electorate. Eyebrows were raised when reporters revealed connections between Russians and pro-Russian forces in Eastern Europe, such as advisor Paul Manafort\u2019s consulting work in the region. Inside the Russian hack on US election When Trump called on Russians to continue hacking in July, he raised more questions about whether he was calling for campaign espionage. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,\u201d he said, referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s messages while she was Secretary of State. Trump later said he was being \u201csarcastic.\u201d There had were warnings about efforts to hack voting machines, though no evidence emerged of this happening. The direct connection between Trump and the Russians was not proven and it is a question that will interest scholars as they try to understand how this unfolded. Over the past week the Russia hacking controversy has intensified. The nation\u2019s intelligence agencies have reached agreement that the Russians hacked the campaign and President Obama has vowed to respond. \u201cWe need to take action,\u201d Obama said, \u201cand we will.\u201d There is not a consensus behind the intentions of the hack but it is pretty clear that the intervention happened. Although President-elect Trump was initially defensive about the news, acting as if it implied he didn\u2019t win legitimately, in recent days there has been some softening of his tone. But he has continued to make a number of very pro-Russian picks, including his possible Secretary of State, in the middle of this major scandal. One of the most damaging moments in the campaign came when Comey announced October 28 that the FBI was looking into emails found on the computer of Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton\u2019s assistant, that could possibly be related to the State Department email scandal. \u201cYesterday,\u201d the letter said, \u201cthe investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case. Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.\u201d  The letter brought a new round of scrutiny into the story about whether Clinton had discussed classified material on non-secure servers, a centerpiece of Trump\u2019s allegation that she was \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d The news stopped Trump\u2019s sliding poll numbers that had resulted from allegations of sexual assault and renewed concerns about whether there was something bigger to the email story after all \u2013 only months after Comey had revealed there was no basis for an indictment. A week later, just two days before the election, Comey released a second letter saying there was nothing in the emails. But Clinton officials say the letter hurt her by bringing up the scandal again so close to the election. Why did Comey do this? Why didn\u2019t he or the President say anything about the investigations into the Russia hacks? Some Democrats speculated that there were partisan motivations behind this decision \u2013 that Comey, who was a registered Republican (up until July) working in a Democratic administration, was out to get the nominee. Others argued that Comey\u2019s commitment to being perceived as apolitical and independent had come under attack when he closed the investigation a few months earlier, so he was determined to show that he was not being intimidated by the Obama administration. Still others argued that he felt the obligation to release the information so that voters would not think, after a Clinton victory, that the results had been unfair. We need to know why Comey did what he did. White House: Trump knew Russia hacked Clinton The Trump campaign featured an overwhelming barrage of angry and derogatory messages about women, about immigrants and about Muslims. The campaign also brought into the open anti-Semitic rhetoric and reactionary talk about race relations. Yet since the election, as experts sort though the data, there has been some pushback from observers who point out that many Trump supporters did not support him because of these messages. Rather, the argument goes, they wanted someone who could help the economy, they liked his personality or attitude, they just wanted to keep voting Republican or they didn\u2019t think much of Hillary Clinton. Even CNN analyst Van Jones, who had been especially emotional in attacking Trump for his dangerous vitriol, is now reminding his viewers that there was much more to the Trump vote. So how much was the hate a driving part of this electoral outcome? This is a very important question, not only to better understand this election but to understand what\u2019s going on in the electorate. It would be a mistake to discount the possibility that many voters were just fine with his rhetoric, and even agreed with what he said. We need to know. Voting-rights experts like Ari Berman and Michael Waldman of the Brennan Center had been warning for months that all of the voting-fraud measures added to the books in the last few years would discourage voters from turning out. Based on spurious allegations of massive voting fraud, a number of states responded to the Supreme Court\u2019s evisceration of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in Shelby V. Holder (2013) by placing more prohibitions and barriers to exercising the right to vote. They also warned that these laws would fall hardest on minority groups who might not have the proper identification or would come to fear just showing up at the voting booth even though they had no reason to do so. This was the first post-Voting Rights Act election, they reminded us. Trump added to his atmosphere by whipping up his supporters with fears of rigged elections and calling on them to go out in states like Pennsylvania to monitor against fraud.  Given that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.5 million votes and that Trump\u2019s victories in key states were extraordinarily narrow, the impact of the laws is important, not simply in terms of the health of our democracy but in terms of the results. Given how narrow Trump\u2019s Electoral College victory was in Wisconsin and Michigan, where such laws are on the books, we need to analyze how they might have depressed the Clinton vote and whether this was part of why she lost. There are many more questions that will fascinate historians, including some that are not simply about the game-change dynamics of the race. Regardless, it is clear that this was a campaign of great mystery. And for all we know, a lot remains to be uncovered.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joshua Spivak is a Senior Fellow at the Hugh L. Carey Institute for Government Reform at Wagner College. The views expressed here are his own. Joshua Spivak: Challenge to Nancy Pelosi's Minority Leader bid is a new twist for Democrats Unlike Republicans, Democrats traditionally stick with their leaders even in hard times, he says Following a disappointing showing on Election Day, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is facing a revolt brewing from the Democratic Party\u2019s backbench. Congressman Tim Ryan, a moderate from Ohio, is challenging Pelosi for the Minority Leader job. For the Republicans, a leadership challenge like this would be nothing new \u2013 the party\u2019s caucus has longed seem to treat their leadership as a target (or at the very least, expendable). But for the Democrats, the emerging contest between Pelosi and Ryan may indicate a new, highly disruptive way of managing their House team. Tim Ryan\u2019s district is located in the economically unsettled Midwest region that cost Hillary Clinton and the Democrats the election. Ryan has been part of the disappearing moderates in Congress, as he at one point earned an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA and once had a more pro-life stance. His focus in the speaker\u2019s race has been on the Democrats\u2019 failure to win over blue-collar workers in the Midwest on economic issues. Just by running, Ryan presents a stark contrast to the San Francisco-based Pelosi. Based on Republicans\u2019 lack of hesitation to challenge or oust their own leaders, it may seem like leadership challenges are a regular feature of congressional life. Speaker Paul Ryan was facing a potential revolt from the right before Trump\u2019s surprising victory. His predecessor, John Boehner, resigned rather than face a potential challenge, as did former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who stepped down after a bad showing in the 1998 election. Minority leaders also have faced the ax from the Republican rank and file. Gingrich himself let the previous minority leader, Robert Michel, know he would challenged for the leadership post in 1994, while Michel\u2019s predecessor, John Rhodes, faced similar threats. Before that, Charles Halleck was tossed out by a revolt led by Gerald Ford. Halleck himself led a successful uprising against then-Minority Leader Joe Martin (the last man to serve as Republican speaker before Gingrich four decades later). Pelosi challenger steps up criticism ahead of leadership fight But Democrats in Congress behave very differently. Despite being out of power in the House for all but four of the last 22 years, the Democrats have not kicked out any of their leaders. While Speaker Jim Wright resigned in 1989 due to scandal, no other Democratic speaker or leader (either majority or minority) has been removed by the party or left early. After losing control in the House in 2010, Nancy Pelosi stayed atop the caucus as the Minority Leader. Her predecessor, Dick Gephardt, maintained his job despite continual failed elections. The same thing happened during Democratic losses of control in 1946 and 1952, with Sam Rayburn sliding from Speaker to Minority Leader. Even challenges are rare. The Democratic leadership position is so set in stone that incumbent party bosses rarely ever face a challenge \u2013 the exception being in 1968, when Speaker John McCormack easily beat back a challenge to his role by Congressman Mo Udall. The Democrats also have kept up a strict line of succession, whereby the majority leader or minority leader would automatically step up to the speakership. In 13 consecutive leadership changes, the speaker had previously been either majority or minority leader (or minority whip, the second-highest ranking position on the minority side). This policy only ended when the Republicans returned to power and demonstrated their enduring willingness to dip down into the ranks \u2013 witness Paul Ryan, Dennis Hastert or the aborted choice of Robert Livingston \u2013 to select a speaker.  If Pelosi is tossed out, Democrats may be facing a similar pattern. The Democratic rank and file may no longer be interested in maintaining a structure that has been unable to get them back into power. Instead, they may start looking for new options and be quick with the hook if the party fails to successfully regain control, or as in the case with recent Republicans, doesn\u2019t present a strong enough opposition to the president\u2019s agenda. Nancy Pelosi has managed to hold on to power, despite the House Democrats being lost in the political wilderness. Even if she survives Ryan\u2019s challenge, future Democratic leaders may no longer be able to maintain their grip on the party\u2019s top spots in the face of electoral failure.",

Chris Christie as chairman of President-elect  Donald Trump\u2019s transition team won\u2019t be the last power play by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a young businessman who is shaping up as one of the central figures of the new administration. Kushner is far less well known than his wife, Ivanka Trump, but is clearly a force to be reckoned with, wielding tremendous influence behind the scenes. It\u2019s widely assumed in political circles that the sacking of Christie was at least partly an act of personal payback by Kushner. Back in 2004, then-U.S. Attorney Christie convicted Kushner\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, on a variety of charges including tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign contributions.  The elder Kushner got the maximum sentence of two years in prison, in part because Christie wrote a tough memo calling Kushner\u2019s actions \u201cfiendish.\u201d Jared Kushner regularly visited his father during the year he served behind bars \u2013 and years later, reportedly helped kill Christie\u2019s chances of becoming Trump\u2019s vice-presidential running mate. With no love lost between the men, it looks like Kushner came out on top again, showing a flair for the hard-knuckled political infighting that is a staple of life in the jungle warfare of Washington. It\u2019s not clear what formal role Kushner will play after Inauguration Day. During Trump\u2019s first post-election visit to the White House, cameras caught Kushner walking and talking with President Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, setting off rumors that Kushner might occupy the same position in the Trump White House. That didn\u2019t happen: Trump tapped Reince Priebus for the chief of state position.  Despite his family connection \u2013 in fact, because of it \u2013 there\u2019s a good chance federal law will prohibit Kushner from holding any government position.  According to Title 5 Section 3110 of the US Code, \u201ca public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement \u2026 any individual who is a relative of the public official.\u201d  The definition of family in the same law includes sons-in-law, which appears to make Kushner ineligible for an official job. But there\u2019s no law against a president turning to a trusted friend or family member for advice or to convey sensitive messages to political allies. Kushner, who owns the Observer newspaper, may also be planning to build a pro-Trump media empire, reportedly talking with industry experts about what it would take to set up \u201cTrump TV\u201d or a similar platform.  While many assumed Trump TV would only get launched if the candidate lost, it\u2019s entirely possible Kushner will end up moving forward anyway. As Christie, among others, has discovered the hard way, it\u2019s a mistake to ignore or underestimate one of the youngest and savviest political players on Team Trump.",

His books include \u201cRalph Ellison,\u201d the two-volume work \u201cThe Life of Langston Hughes\u201d and \u201cJackie Robinson: A Biography.\u201d The views expressed here are his. Arnold Rampersad: Tim Kaine reminded supporters election loss was only one setback Works by Langston Hughes, William Faulkner served bittersweet moment well, he says Tim Kaine adorned with two literary references his introduction to Hillary Clinton when she gave her historic concession speech before an audience of their bitterly disappointed supporters. One was to a poem by Langston Hughes, the other to a fragment of fiction by William Faulkner. Both writers served the bittersweet moment well, if in different ways. I say \u201cbitter,\u201d because fresh blood was still flowing from the wounds inflicted by Donald Trump\u2019s army; I say \u201csweet,\u201d because the quality of Kaine\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s speeches as they faced defeat reminded some of us of the resilience of the human spirit. In his remarks, Kaine recited one of Hughes\u2019 youthful poems, \u201cDreams\u201d: Hold fast to dreamsFor if dreams dieLife is a broken-winged birdThat cannot fly. Hold fast to dreamsFor when dreams goLife is a barren fieldFrozen with snow. Since Hughes\u2019 poem makes no allusion to politics or racism, we can take it at face value as a lyric meditation on our need to resist despair when facing life\u2019s vicissitudes \u2013 those troubles from which no one, no matter how privileged, is exempt. The poem speaks to the essence of living. Nevertheless, it is difficult to know that a young black man composed it during some of the worst years of Jim Crow in America and not see it at once as a political rallying cry despite its sentimentality. Tim Kaine: I'm proud of Hillary But the dream was a marinating, evolving motif in Hughes\u2019 work. It would achieve its most mature form probably in the popular \u201cHarlem.\u201d That work begins with the question \u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred?\u201d and ends with the threat \u201cOr does it explode?\u201d The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. would pick up on Hughes\u2019 dream imagery in his most celebrated oration, which we remember for its recurrent assertion \u201cI Have a Dream.\u201d That speech underscored his hopes for an America that would conquer social injustice ingrained into our daily life as a consequence of slavery. One is reminded also of Hughes\u2019 militant anthem of the Great Depression, \u201cLet America Be America Again,\u201d which appeared in 1936: (America \u201cnever was America to me,\u201d and yet America \u201cmust be.\u201d)  Introducing Clinton, Kaine paired the sentimentality of Hughes with something much more muscular, and even menacing. With his invocation of Wash Jones\u2019 defiant line \u2013 \u201cThey kilt us but they ain\u2019t whupped us yit\u201d \u2013 from Faulkner\u2019s 1936 novel, \u201cAbsalom, Absalom!\u201d \u2013 one is tempted to say that Kaine in a sense brought a bayonet to what had been a war of words. It\u2019s a strange turnaround, and an odd application of the deeper lessons of the Civil War, but one that makes sense. Kaine is from Virginia, where they live and breathe this sense of American history and its symbolism. The grand fight now is for the future of America. Kaine was reminding his and Clinton\u2019s people that their election loss was only one setback, like Bull Run, when the South routed Union forces and terrified many people in the North, but it is not the end of the war. The courage of the rebel South in the Civil War is distinct from the pro-slavery goals of that same rebel South. In a paradoxical reprising of what took place in America in the 1860s, the remarkable courage of the rebel South is there to be invoked and emulated in what his and Clinton\u2019s supporters must often see as a primal battle, a new civil war, for the soul and state of America.",

McDonald is a professor of constitutional law at Pepperdine University School of Law in Malibu, California, and is a former law clerk for the late Chief Justice of the United States William H. Rehnquist. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Both Trump and Clinton speak as if the Supreme Court justices are supposed to carry out a political agenda, writes Barry McDonald We shouldn't empower unelected judges to act that way, he says As a professor who teaches constitutional law, last week\u2019s final presidential debate disturbed me. And it was not necessarily the prospect of having a particular candidate elected who I\u2019m concerned about. It was the back and forth on the Supreme Court. It started with one of Chris Wallace\u2019s first questions: \u201c[W]here do you want to see the court take the country?\u201d Excuse me? This sounded like an inquiry about political leadership that should have been addressed to the candidates themselves. Since when did an institution that is supposed to apply neutral principles of law to resolve disputes become a third political branch of our government?  And when did judges who have built-in protection from being politically accountable to the people \u2013 such as lifetime jobs and salary protections \u2013 become our new political leaders? Bush v. Gore lawyer: Trump's dangerous nonsense The appropriate response, at least the one Alexander Hamilton or James Madison would likely have given, was to push back on the question. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think it is the role of unelected judges to lead the country, I do think your question about how they should interpret our fundamental law is very important.\u201d  (Wallace had also asked about whether judges should interpret the Constitution as an evolving document or stick with its historical meanings.) Yet both Clinton and Trump proceeded to ignore the latter question and treated the leadership question as the only one meriting a response. Clinton:  \u201c[T]he Supreme Court \u2026 really raises the central issue in this election. Namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have? And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people.\u201d Ginsburg: I regret my Trump remarks Trump: \u201cThe Supreme Court, it is what it is all about \u2026. it is just so imperative that we have the right justices.\u201d Then their more detailed responses sounded like more calls to political action. Clinton proclaimed we needed a Court that would \u201crepresent all\u201d Americans and \u201cstand up\u201d for women, the LGBT community and workers, and against electioneering spending by corporations. Trump touted how he would appoint justices that would be \u201cpro-life,\u201d have a \u201cconservative bent,\u201d \u201cautomatically\u201d overturn Roe v. Wade, and \u201cprotect the Second Aamendment\u201d \u2014 while at the same time expressing appreciation to the NRA lobby for its support. (Trump also asserted such justices would be those the founders would have favored.) What\u2019s wrong with this picture? In an era when the court is already under heavy criticism for deciding cases based on the justices\u2019 political preferences and clothing them with legal opinions (think Bush v. Gore), such rhetoric by our presidential candidates is downright destructive. Our future chief executive officers are legitimizing and enabling the court as a political actor, rather than an institution dedicated to providing \u201cEqual Justice Under Law\u201d (as the Supreme Court building itself proclaims). Our future chief executive officers are legitimizing and enabling the court as a political actor rather than an institution dedicated to providing \u2018Equal Justice Under Law\u2019 Barry P. McDonald When this happens, the American public loses confidence in the court as a place where any person can get a fair hearing based on the merits of their legal claims. What the candidates should be insisting on is the appointment of justices who put their political biases aside and, even in ideologically-charged cases, do their best to interpret and apply the general law of the Constitution in an objective and principled way. Scholars have proposed various ways to achieve this. To name one of the most promising, insist on pledges from nominees that, as justices, when writing opinions they would analyze what answer each of the major techniques for interpreting the Constitution \u2013 its text, historical purpose, and general goals, as well as earlier precedents and modern societal needs/values \u2013 would point to for a particular question. Such transparency in reasoning might prevent justices from doing what many say they\u2019re doing now \u2013 strategically selecting one or more interpretive sources that would favor the result they wish to reach in a particular case (e.g., historical intent for gun rights, or modern needs/values for gay marriage) and ignoring those that might point to a different answer. Moreover, we should insist that the justices first see how the law \u201cwrites\u201d before deciding a case, rather than its current method of taking a straw poll on how a case should come out and then assigning a justice to write a post hoc opinion justifying that result. In other words, the justices should first see where rigorous legal reasoning takes them in a written opinion before committing to a particular  result.  During the heated battle as to whether or not Americans should adopt the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton attempted to defend against opposition group charges that the new \u201cSupreme Court\u201d being proposed by that document would create a nonaccountable body that would exercise undue power in a democracy. He responded by writing the court would be the branch of government \u201cleast dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution\u201d because, unlike Congress or the president, it had neither the purse nor the sword, but \u201cmerely judgment.\u201d To retain public support and to fulfill its intended constitutional role, it is imperative that the court exercise that judgment impartially on behalf of all Americans.  Having our future presidents cast Supreme Court justices as  political warriors disserves this constitutional vision.",

Louis Gohmert made fun of people with disabilities while mocking Clinton Perry: Trump mocked a reporter with disability, Coulter said Trump was mimicking a \"standard retard\" Perry: This doesn't play with many voters. And voters with disabilities will make views known at ballot box On Friday morning, Representative Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) stood before the Values Voters Summit and made fun of people with disabilities. After a joke about people running for office being \u201cno-brainers,\u201d he got mock-serious. \u201cAnd I do want to warn,\u201d he said, \u201cSince most people here are Christians \u2026 A true believer does what Jesus did \u2026 you don\u2019t make fun of people who are impaired, have special needs. And whether you like her or not, Hillary Clinton has made clear she is mentally impaired.\u201d The crowd then displayed their values, laughing and clapping loudly. This is funny? Everyone needs to stop using disability as a punchline. Whatever you think of Clinton, jokes from people who should be leaders \u2013 like Gohmert \u2013 and the crowd\u2019s giddy response come with very real collateral damage for millions of people with disabilities whose humanity is too easily ignored. For example? Stigma prevents disabled workers fully able to participate in the job market from achieving financial independence. Objectifying people with disabilities has a direct connection to the high rate in which people with disabilities are both sexually assaulted and denied the right to have consensual sex. Meanwhile, rather than being integrated into communities, people with disabilities remain trapped in jails, nursing homes and psychiatric institutions. The work to do is vast, should be nonpartisan, and Louie Gohmert isn\u2019t helping. What\u2019s worse, it\u2019s not just him. What is it with Republicans making fun of people with disabilities this election cycle? Haven\u2019t they learned their lesson? And will the millions of disabled voters and the many more who are tightly connected to people with disabilities punish them at the polls for their horrible humor? It started last fall when Donald Trump made fun of a New York Times reporter who is disabled. Trump claimed that Serge Kovaleski has reported on New Jersey Muslims celebrating 9/11. Kovaleski, a brilliant reporter, hadn\u2019t, and said so. Trump took to the state in South Carolina and flailed his arm about, dropping his wrist, in a way that mimicked Kovaleski\u2019s actual disability\u2014he has arthrogryposis.  Taking on a silly voice, Trump said, \u201c\u2018Ah, I don\u2019t know what I said! I don\u2019t remember!\u2019\u201d The scene has been played now millions of times, in part because Democrats discovered it\u2019s a powerful wedge to drive between Trump and his potential voters. It\u2019s led to numerous ads from pro-Clinton forces.  There may be many traditional GOP voters willing to overlook remarks by Trump that I find racist, sexist or fascist, but mocking people with disabilities still makes them hesitate. Down syndrome should not be feared The GOP knows it. Trump, a man who defines himself as unapologetic and not politically correct, has tried to explain that he was just being \u201cvery expressive.\u201d  Voters didn\u2019t buy it, so Ann Coulter, in her new book \u201cIn Trump We Trust,\u201d tried a new tactic. She wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s true that Trump was not mimicking any mannerisms that Serge has. He doesn\u2019t jerk around or flail his arms. He\u2019s not retarded. He sits calmly, but if you look at his wrists, you\u2019ll see they are curved in. That\u2019s not the imitation Trump was doing \u2013 he was doing a standard retard, waving his arms and sounding stupid.\u201d It\u2019s not just Coulter, who has a long history of using such ableist slurs, or Trump. Over the past month, the mainstream GOP has adopted fringe alt-right conspiracy theories that Clinton has a \u201csecret illness.\u201d Bullied deaf student's belongings dumped in toilet The media, eager to report \u201cboth sides,\u201d has now begun to report on whether Clinton coughs. When I pushed back against the coughing meme on Twitter, my account was flooded with conspiracy theorists telling me her coughing is a sign of Parkinson\u2019s, epilepsy, strokes, cancer and dozens of other conditions. Now Gohmert, speaking before Christians, draws laughs by saying that Clinton has special needs or that maybe she was hit in the head by one of the hammers used to destroy BlackBerries. His audience loved it. But America doesn\u2019t. Thanks to the efforts of groups like #CripTheVote and #RevUp from the American Association of People with Disabilities, the disability community has never been more organized. Teacher's awful mistreatment of special needs child Gregg Beratran, one of the founders of the #CripTheVote movement, told me, \u201cI think that this has become an alarming trend. More and more we seem to see disability used as a means of disparaging people we disagree with. They all seem to think that their politics justify or outweigh the harm they do to the disability community.\u201d Andrew Pulrang, another founder, added, \u201cDisabled people in ordinary life are dismissed in this way all the time. You\u2019re \u2018crazy\u2019 so there\u2019s no need to hear what you say. You\u2019re sick or disabled, so of course you\u2019re not a serious person in whatever field is being discussed. These kinds of remarks in politics bring this everyday ableism to a national scale.\u201d These organizations are ready to make sure that people relying on disability stigma to insult their opponents will lose at the ballot box. Art in motion I am an equal-opportunity critic of ableist taunting of people with disabilities. In 2008, I criticized Democrats who objectified Trig Palin, Sarah Palin\u2019s son with Down syndrome. I spoke out against Rahm Emanuel\u2019s use of the r-word and when Obama joked about the Special Olympics. Just this last July for CNN, I objected to the attempt to label Donald Trump \u201ccrazy\u201d as stigmatizing and ableist. Now it\u2019s the GOP\u2019s turn. Stop making fun of people with disabilities. Speak out when your candidates, elected officials, and intellectual leaders do it. If you won\u2019t do it for me, for my family, for the people you know who have disabilities, or in order to fight stigma, then fine. Do it because you want to win. It turns out, no one likes a bully.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Sracic is professor and chairman of the department of politics and international relations at Youngstown State University and a former Fulbright scholar in Japan. The views expressed are his own. Paul Sracic says Trump has shown the potential to attract working-class voters in the swing state of Ohio Latest national poll, from CNN, shows the race is essentially even Tuesday\u2019s CNN poll shows Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump winning the support of about two-thirds of white registered voters without a college degree. I\u2019m sure there are some Democratic strategists out there who are tempted to say in response, \u201cSo, what else is new?\u201d  After all, in 2012, President Obama lost the white, working-class vote by 26 points,  while still being comfortably re-elected. When looking at numbers like this, however, it\u2019s important to remember that we vote for president by state, with most of the outcomes easily predicted before the election even takes place. The focus, therefore, is always on the dozen or so swing states that remain unpredictable. Here the story gets more interesting. The demographics of the swing states vary, and candidates win by cobbling together unique coalitions of voters. In Ohio in 2012, for example, some white working-class voters, namely those who lived in union households, were an important part of the Obama coalition.  In fact, a study by Peyton M. Craighill and Scott Clement showed that union households were largely responsible for holding down the margin of Obama\u2019s overall loss of the white working-class vote in Ohio to only 14 points.  Considering how close the election was in Ohio four years ago, this was significant. Obama narrowly won the key swing state. Republicans for Clinton: Why we oppose Trump It is helpful to understand where these union households are in Ohio.  A lot of them are in areas like Youngstown, where Trump campaigned on Labor Day.  This explains why the Youngstown metropolitan area, which has a large number of white working-class voters, has remained one of the Buckeye state\u2019s most Democratic areas. If you look at past ballots in the two counties that make up this region \u2013 among the larger counties in the state, with a combined population of well over 400,000 \u2013 you will see that voters have been so loyal to the Democratic Party that Republicans often don\u2019t even bother to field candidates in many races, especially during presidential years.  This is because it is common in the primaries in these counties for five or six Democratic ballots to be cast for every one Republican vote.  In general elections, any Republican who passes 35% of the vote is thought to have done well. That\u2019s what makes this year so stunning.  In the March primary in Mahoning County, where Youngstown is the county seat, there were almost an equal number of Democratic and Republican votes.  Over half of those Republican votes were cast for Donald Trump.  In neighboring Trumbull County, similar results were seen. How do we explain this crossover appeal?  First of all, it is important to recognize that this sort of crossover voting really is unusual, especially in presidential races. Political scientists know that one of the best ways to guess someone\u2019s party affiliation is to ask about their parents.  So for many people, political affiliation is part of their inheritance, perhaps even in the genetic sense. Once inherited, our political party becomes part of our identity. Studies show that we use our partisan lens to filter out contrary political information, and maybe even other people who don\u2019t share our political leanings. A different reason to vote for Trump It is therefore extremely difficult for individuals to switch parties.  It is like asking a New York Yankees fan to cheer for the Boston Red Sox.  So how is it that so many of these Democratic voters in Youngstown were able to cross over and vote for Donald Trump in the Ohio primary?  Well, they could easily tell themselves that they were not really becoming Republicans. Trump\u2019s secret weapon with these voters is that they know he is not really a Republican.  For these voters, the classic Republican is someone like Mitt Romney or Jeb Bush \u2013 who they see as country club Republicans, representing the interests of the rich. Trump, ironically the billionaire owner of many such country clubs, has somehow managed to sell himself as the anti-Romney, and the slayer of Bush.  The hatred that both of these traditional Republicans show for Trump actually helps him convey this message.  It is telling that some of these Ohio Democrats who supported Trump said they wanted to \u201cswitch to the Trump party.\u201d  But Trump\u2019s weapon is potentially a two-edged sword.  Notice how Barack Obama, when he spoke at the Democratic National Convention, mentioned the Republican icon Ronald Reagan, and noted that Trump was nothing like a normal Republican, with whom he might have honest policy differences. This message was not intended for Democrats, and certainly not aimed at Sanders\u2019 supporters; it was directed at moderate Republicans who might feel just as uncomfortable as working-class Democrats with the idea of \u201cswitching teams.\u201d Obama\u2019s words, combined with the fact that Hillary Clinton has selected a pro-life Democrat whose father-in-law was a Republican governor as her running mate, shows that the Democratic leaders know they have a shot at pulling in their own crossover voters this year. So looking at the white working-class vote this year may tell us only part of the story. In 2012, more than 90% of both Democrats and Republicans who voted supported their party\u2019s nominee. This year, the winner may be the one who can steal the most voters from the other team.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Danny Cevallos: For Melania Trump, the decision to sue these defendants is a business decision In a post Hulk Hogan/Gawker world, a lawsuit is worth it, he says Melania Trump has filed suit against The Daily Mail and Tarpley, a US-based blog, alleging false and defamatory statements about her supposed involvement in an escort service. Most citizens are surprised to learn that freedom of speech is not absolute. Some speech doesn\u2019t receive First Amendment protection.  Defamation is an example of unprotected speech. Defamation is a false statement of fact that lowers the reputation of a person in the community or deters others from associating with her. Defamation encompasses two forms: libel (written) and slander (oral). Normally, defamation cases are the bane of lawyers\u2019 existence.  Every attorney has fielded a call from some distant relative or kooky friend who believes their life has been ruined because of what their Aunt Edna posted on Facebook.  These are rarely viable defamation cases. First, being called a doofus on social media, for most of us, doesn\u2019t cause us any provable financial harm.  Second, Aunt Edna \u2014 and everyone else who wastes their time insulting people on Twitter \u2014 doesn\u2019t have any money.  These are people who have too much free time on their hands to have a career or a savings account.  These defendants don\u2019t have any money that would interest a lawyer in taking the case on a contingent fee. Republicans for Clinton: Why we oppose Trump For a defamation case to be worth bringing, it has to involve people with a monetized image, who are disparaged by defendants with big bank accounts.  Otherwise, it\u2019s just not worth it.  There are still plenty of defamation cases filed by regular folks; they\u2019re just filed \u201cpro se,\u201d because no lawyer would take them. For Melania Trump, the decision to go after these defendants is a business decision: The payout must be worth the risk and cost of a prolonged, public lawsuit.  In the past, many public figures have concluded it\u2019s not worth it. But in a post Hulk Hogan/Gawker world, the analysis has changed.  Now, a lawsuit is worth it.   If you\u2019re a powerful person, like Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, and you want to finance a takedown of a media outlet you perceive as an enemy, you can apparently invest in a plaintiff and his attorneys, and potentially destroy an entire news organization. A different reason to vote for Trump The lawyer who filed the suit on Trump\u2019s behalf is Charles Harder, who also represented Hulk Hogan in his successful suit, in which a jury issued a $115 million verdict against Gawker. Harder has estimated the damages suffered by Melania Trump amount to even more:  $150 million. Before filing suit, Harder put the Daily Mail, Tarpley and other news organization on notice that the articles about her were defamatory. And the Daily Mail quickly retracted its article, saying:  \u201cThe point of the article was that these allegations could impact the US presidential election even if they are untrue. Mrs. Trump\u2019s counsel in the US and the UK have stated unequivocally that the allegations about the modeling agencies are false.\u201d Is Peter Thiel right about Gawker? \u201cTo the extent that anything in the Daily Mail\u2019s article was interpreted as stating or suggesting that Mrs. Trump worked as an \u2018escort\u2019 or in the \u2018sex business,\u2019 that she had a \u2018composite or presentation card for the sex business,\u2019 or that either of the modeling agencies referenced in the article were engaged in these businesses, it is hereby retracted, and the Daily Mail newspaper regrets any such misinterpretation,\u201d the statement read. Nevertheless, Harder told CNNMoney the lawsuit will move ahead despite the retraction. In reading the complaint, one may notice that the offending statements appear to quote other sources.  But these defendants cannot simply counter that they were just publishing something someone else said.  It is a well-settled principle that one is liable for republishing the defamatory statement of another. News organizations have strong monetary incentives to vet their sources.  In this case, the defendants won\u2019t be able to hide behind the fact that they were just relaying what someone else told them about Melania Trump. Of course, truth is a defense to defamation cases, too.  Because the statement has to be false, the defendants could win if they wanted to dig in and insist that everything they said about Melania Trump is true.  But both defendants have already printed retractions to the offending material.  It would be difficult for them to publicly reverse position and try to prove they are true now.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael D\u2019Antonio is the author of the new book, \u201cThe Truth About Trump.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Biographer Michael D'Antonio says Trump has long been fascinated with Russia and admiring of \"strong men\" like Putin His running mate was right to point out serious consequences of potential Russian meddling in the campaign, D'Antonio says As Mike Pence seems to be learning fast, Donald Trump is not inclined to think much before speaking. Amid growing concern that Russia was behind the recent hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer accounts, Trump said he hopes the Russians have Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails from her days as secretary of state.  Pence, Trump\u2019s running mate, quickly distanced himself from this sentiment, saying there should be \u201cserious consequences\u201d for any foreign power meddling in an American election. The dissonance between Trump and Pence, who served in Congress and spoke as a national leader is expected to speak, arose after Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff remarks at a press conference he conducted at one of his golf courses in Florida. In typical style, Trump was flippant about the apparent meddling in U.S. affairs.  \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, he said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d The hacked DNC emails, which included some that disparaged Hillary Clinton\u2019s opponent, Bernie Sanders, were released by the organization called WikiLeaks on the eve of the Democratic National Convention and forced the resignation of national committee chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he intended to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s  campaign with the release.  Assange, who has lived for years in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London, avoiding extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual misconduct, said that \u201cno one knows who our source is.\u201d Dems accuse Trump of disloyalty over Clinton emails The one source mentioned most often by Clinton aides, pundits including conservative George Will, and U.S. intelligence services, is the Russian government led by Vladimir Putin.  (The best evidence for the link was discovered by a British professor who revealed it earlier this month.) Trump has made no secret of his admiration for the Russian leader \u2013 and don\u2019t forget that\u2019s the man who ordered the forceful takeover of Crimea, invaded Ukraine, and intimidated opponents at home.  When asked about Putin\u2019s record, which included allegations that he killed journalists, Trump dismissed the concern, saying he had seen no evidence to support the charges.  \u201cAt least he\u2019s a leader,\u201d Trump said admiringly, \u201cunlike what we have in this country.\u201d Trump has long been fascinated with Russia and, before its dissolution, the Soviet Union. During the early 1980s he told The Washington Post that President Reagan should give him the job of negotiating nuclear arms agreements with the USSR. \u201cIt would take an hour and a half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles,\u201d he noted. He declined to say exactly what he would propose be done about arsenals with enough power to destroy the world several times over. However, he assured the paper that, \u201cIt\u2019s something that somebody should do that knows how to negotiate and not the kind of representatives that I have seen in the past.\u201d Why Trump will never be presidential At the time he volunteered, Trump\u2019s major achievements included the renovation of a big hotel at Grand Central Terminal and the construction of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.  Negotiation was no doubt an element in these successes but they depended far more on the political connections and the $200 million fortune accumulated by his father during his decades of work as a local developer. Then, as now, no evidence could be found to suggest Trump would make a talented diplomat. In fact, given his tendency to insult others, he seemed like the last person to send to handle a delicate matter. Who is Donald Trump? No government officials from either party ever invited Trump into the arms control negotiations conducted by the United States with Russia.  However, beginning in the 1980s he made various attempts to do business in Moscow.  In 1987 he traveled there and hinted that he would meet with leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but the get-together never happened. Trump didn\u2019t seal any deals to do business in Russia. Since then, competitors in the hotel business, including Ritz Carlton and Hilton, have established beachheads there, but not Trump.  As he has said, he has \u201czero investments\u201d in Russia. Zero investments does not mean Trump has no relationships with powerful Russians.  Indeed, as Donald Trump Jr. noted in 2008, Russians invest in Trump properties. \u201cWe see a lot of money pouring in from Russia,\u201d he told a conference, according to a business publication called eTurboNews quoted by The Washington Post. In 2013, the elder Trump held the Miss Universe beauty pageant in Moscow. Though invited, Putin didn\u2019t show up. (He sent a gift and a nice note.) Trump reported that \u201calmost all of the oligarchs were in the room.\u201d During the current presidential campaign, Trump has veered from the political mainstream, where Putin is generally regarded as an authoritarian rival of the United States and the West. When Putin complimented him, Trump said the praise was \u201ca great honor.\u201d  Months later Trump told a crowd at a rally that he would not renounce Putin\u2019s support. \u201cA guy calls me a genius and I\u2019m going to renounce,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not going to renounce.\u201d Ivanka Trump, a champion for women? Given all the mutual admiration, after he appeared on the same episode of the news program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Trump told a GOP debate audience, \u201cI got to know him very well on \u201960 Minutes.\u2019 We were stablemates.\u201d  Although these comments left the impression that Trump met Putin, in fact they had never met. (At least that\u2019s what Trump says now.) Listen to the Trump voters If Trump wants to establish a relationship with Putin today he could use his own campaign staff to make an overture. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort  has been involved in politics in the Ukraine for at least 10 years.  An international political consultant, Manafort is widely reported to have worked to help the pro-Putin party of Viktor Yanukovych.  Manafort polished up Yanukovich\u2019s style and his client eventually became Ukraine\u2019s president in 2010. In his short reign Yanukovych  became an exceedingly rich man who lived on a vast estate, built with public funds, where the grounds held a zoo, a reproduction of an ancient galleon, and a private car collection.  When a pro-Western uprising forced him to flee the country, he said  Putin \u201chelped my security to get me out, and save my life.\u201d Although he was probably the only one rescued by Putin, Viktor Yanukovych was not the only authoritarian leader aided by Manafort\u2019s consulting firm.  In a report published in 1992 by the Center for Public Integrity, the company\u2019s roster of clients was reported to include numerous despotic regimes.  Trump seems to have a similar affinity for authoritarian leaders. During the campaign Trump has voiced admiration for North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, Moammar Gadhafi and Saddam Hussein.  What Trump admires in these men is the quality he admires in himself, strength evidenced by their successes. Throughout his life, going back to his days as a schoolboy cadet at New York Military Academy, Trump has strived to reach personal goals \u2013 power, wealth, fame \u2013 through the demonstration of strength.  Trump sees a kindred soul in men who suffer with the strong man complex, rising to power on the basis of sheer will and exercising it ruthlessly.  For much of the Western world, Putin is the ultimate example of this dynamic. And like Pence, many people would agree that Trump is playing a risky game by encouraging the Russian leader.",

Cupp is the author of \u201cLosing Our Religion: The Liberal Media\u2019s Attack on Christianity,\u201d co-author of \u201cWhy You\u2019re Wrong About the Right\u201d and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Hillary Clinton chose moderate Democrat Tim Kaine rather than a member of the progressive wing S.E. Cupp: At the risk of upsetting some Sanders supporters, Clinton opted for a choice that's politically expedient At the dawn of the Democratic National Convention, during which she\u2019d accept the nomination of her party for president, Hillary Clinton had a choice. She could pick a running mate who would assure Bernie Sanders and his supporters that she heard his calls for progressive reforms, or she could pick a running mate who would help her win a general election. In Tim Kaine, she made an emphatic choice for the latter. Lock her up? 4 ways for Hillary Clinton to strike back Despite her insistence throughout the Democratic primary that she had found progressive religion \u2013 promising she was not beholden to Wall Street, embracing a $15 minimum wage (with caveats), shifting her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, announcing Bernie-like plans for debt-free college \u2013 let it be known that Hillary Clinton is nothing if not a political creature, who puts politics first, principles second. Unsurprisingly, Sanders\u2019 supporters are not happy. A group of 1,250 Sanders delegates called the Bernie Delegates Network surveyed its members and reported, according to the Boston Herald, that 89% found the selection of Kaine unacceptable. A spokesperson for the group, Jeff Cohen, said, \u201cThe reaction of the choice of Kaine goes from disappointment to anger,\u201d and he expected Sanders\u2019 supporters to protest at the convention in Philadelphia. What is surprising, however, is that her detractors on the far-left seem caught off guard by Clinton\u2019s about-face \u2013 her embrace of a centrist Democrat who is pro-life, supports TPP, off-shore drilling and spending cuts \u2013 after wrapping her figurative arms around Sanders throughout the primary. They shouldn\u2019t be; her life and career have been defined by her cunning penchant for making politically expedient choices. Her life and career have been defined by her cunning penchant for making politically expedient choices. S.E. Cupp But the flip-side of that cynicism is a canny knack for political maneuverability and survivability, which she\u2019s demonstrated time and again \u2013 winning a Senate race just months after her husband was impeached, turning a failed presidential run into a high-level Cabinet appointment, dodging charges for mishandling classified information. You could argue that politicians more wedded to their principles than their survival do not often last as long as she has or rise as far. In picking Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton missed an opportunity Her veep pick epitomizes the ease with which she can separate the two. As a 58-year old white male, Kaine speaks neither to the diversity wing of the Democratic party nor the millennials \u2013 essentially the heart of the Obama coalition \u2013 betraying many progressives\u2019 hopes for a doubly \u201chistoric\u201d ticket: two women, for example, or a woman and a Hispanic. He does, however, speak to one of Clinton\u2019s main deficiencies: blue collar, middle-aged white male Democrats who think the party has left them. And this political calculation is why she chose Kaine. The Democratic Party has been bleeding white men for years. So-called blue dog Democrats, moderates from swing states like Kaine, are a nearly extinct species. Many think the party\u2019s progressive swing leftward, with a hyperfocus on social issues like contraception and transgender bathrooms, have locked blue collar, working white men out of the conversation, ignored in favor of courting every other kind of voter. Clinton campaign chief discusses Kaine's abortion shift A Washington Post/ABC News poll found that a whopping 75% of white men view Clinton unfavorably, and only 23% have a favorable view. Tim Kaine might be the kind of man they do like. While veep selections are rarely consequential, Clinton\u2019s own unfavorables are so high that her running mate could actually have a small impact. One Democratic strategist told me that Elizabeth Warren might have kept some Democrats home. Tim Kaine allows some to turn out. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. As a Republican, I think her selection should be instructive. Far too often, conservatives prioritize purity over winning. You have to win an election to get your policies empowered. While we should all reject her naked dishonesty and shameful lack of accountability, there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to win. Sanders\u2019 supporters disappointment is understandable, but ultimately, to her, unimportant.",

He is president of the Hamilton Foundation; a principal with DC Advisory, a public policy consultancy; and the author of \u201cSmart Power: Between Diplomacy and War.\u201d The views expressed are his own. Christian Whiton: Donald Trump's two most recent speeches could mark a turning point Trump seems to be trying to expand the circle of those to whom he appeals, Whiton says When he began prepared remarks last week about the mass killing in Orlando, Donald Trump noted, \u201cThis was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what\u2019s going on. \u2026\u201d On Wednesday, he finally delivered that speech while also presenting his broader agenda. He did it in an unusually orderly, measured manner. If there is indeed a Trump presidency, these two set-piece performances could end up being seen as a turning point in his communications style and campaign management. Both speeches were remarkable, whether one agrees with their content or not. Discussing the Orlando attack, in which the perpetrator pledged allegiance to ISIS, Trump said: \u201cMany of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions,\u201d and added, \u201cThe bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into America and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing.\u201d This was a watershed: No presidential nominee has been so blunt on this topic. In Wednesday\u2019s speech, Trump attacked Clinton as promised but also refined his populist message in tones intended to appeal to disgruntled voters across the political spectrum, including an explicit appeal to supporters of Bernie Sanders. \u201cHillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft,\u201d he said. But he also inveighed that \u201cit\u2019s not just the political system that\u2019s rigged. It\u2019s the whole economy\u201d \u2013 rare words for a major presidential candidate, especially a Republican. Trump then methodically outlined how he believes donors, bureaucrats and big business have screwed the little guy. He also provided a long list of Clinton\u2019s lapses of ethics and judgment. This was a somewhat different Trump style than the one displayed over the last year: ad-lib remarks and interviews that bordered on stream of consciousness, and which infuriated opponents because they were indelicate and inspired supporters because they were genuine. Trump has not gone \u201ckinder and gentler,\u201d but he does now have a clear communications plan that stems from a clear political plan. For now, that plan appears to be to retain the agenda and arguments that won him the Republican nomination against all odds, while expanding the circle of those to whom he appeals. In addition to his shout-out to Sanders supporters, Trump also repeatedly expressed sympathetic concern in both speeches for gays \u2013 a constituency Democrats have taken for granted and that elite Republicans have intentionally alienated. Is Donald Trump right about Hillary Clinton? This appeal is cleverer than it seems. Gay votes aren\u2019t likely to make a difference in the presidential election, and Republicans must accept that gays, like Jewish voters, will remain stubbornly Democratic for the foreseeable future. But by sounding unlike any major Republican in history, Trump hopes to appeal to a different coalition of voters than either party has contemplated before. And speaking differently about gays may attract far more than just gay votes \u2013 Trump\u2019s appeal is emotional and stylistic more than it is policy-based. This may be true of any modern presidential candidate, but for Trump it is more so. Will this new approach continue? Much has been said of recent staff changes in the Trump campaign, especially the departure of manager Corey Lewandowski. Perhaps as important, but less reported, has been the recent hiring of Kevin Kellems, a communications and policy pro with deep experience at the Pentagon, White House and on Republican campaigns \u2013 including Newt Gingrich\u2019s anti-establishment presidential campaign in 2012. The theory goes that this evolution in staff could mean that Trump\u2019s new tack will continue. It probably will, but only up to a point. Trump did not get this far in life and politics by reading off a teleprompter, and his confidence in his instincts likely remains unfettered. Like him or not, part of Trump\u2019s political appeal is that he is entertaining, and part of what makes him entertaining is his unscripted spontaneity. That won\u2019t end, but the watershed of the last two weeks suggests a much clearer link between Trump\u2019s political strategy and his communications. The latest Jacksonian wave to shake the foundations of American politics \u2013 the essence of Trump\u2019s populist insurgency \u2013 has gotten more organized.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Sally Kohn, a Bernie Sanders supporter, says he has lost primary race to Hillary Clinton She says Sanders must turn discontent into action -- a revolution to defeat Donald Trump On March 31, 1973, when Muhammad Ali stepped into a boxing ring in San Diego, he was wearing a robe given to him by Elvis Presley and he was favored 5-1 to beat Ken Norton, who was then rated No. 6 in the world. But after 12 rounds, Ali had a broken jaw and Norton won the split decision. After the defeat, only the second in his career, Ali said, \u201cI never thought of losing, but now that it\u2019s happened, the only thing is to do it right. That\u2019s my obligation to all the people who believe in me. We all have to take defeats in life.\u201d Bernie Sanders, listen to Muhammad Ali. The Democratic primary is over. Hillary Clinton has secured the 2,383 delegates required to win her party\u2019s presidential nomination \u2013 amassing both more pledged delegates and superdelegates than Sanders. It was unfortunate that the AP decided to call the race before states like California and New Jersey weighed in, but even those votes are just to confirm the now foregone conclusion.  Say what you will about the primary rules and whether they should be reconsidered, Hillary Clinton played by those rules and won fair and square.  And Bernie Sanders lost. The only thing left now is for Sanders \u201cto do it right.\u201d I still believe in Bernie Sanders. I believe in his commitment to make the Democratic Party more accountable to progressive populist values and to make American elections more accountable to voters. That has been his revolutionary mission from day one \u2013 to disentangle our political system from Wall Street and big business and thus render the decisions and actions of politics less reflexively centrist. And Sanders has already succeeded. Clinton is a more progressive and accountable candidate because of Sanders.  Her positions on fracking, universal health care and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal have all become more progressive because of Sanders\u2019 prodding. That\u2019s good for Democrats and for Clinton. On the one hand, with Sanders out of contention, more progressive positions will help Clinton animate the Democratic base in the general election. And faced with Donald Trump, whose candidacy has in no small part been fueled by his anti-trade tirades, Clinton is in a stronger position to appeal to swing voters on this key populist issue. Plus Sanders has made Clinton a better candidate in terms of style as well as substance.  In debates and on the stump, Clinton has genuinely gotten better at being relaxed as well as at sharpening her points. Having a challenger forced her to raise her game for black and Latino voters, who likely otherwise would have been taken for granted as they usually are by the Democratic establishment. Hillary Clinton's historic moment Though I wish it had been even more pronounced than a few questions about \u201cvoters of color\u201d during the Sanders-Clinton debates, it was still a noticeable and welcome change that we were discussing this at all, largely due to the unrelenting and important leadership of Black Lives Matter and pro-immigrant rights advocacy groups. The longer-term work of the Sanders revolution remains unfinished, however. The Democratic Party still must grapple with how it reflects the broader populist moment sweeping the Democratic base and the entire country. Voters on both sides of the aisle are clearly fed up with politics as it is \u2013 and understandably so. And Sanders remains uniquely positioned not only to crystalize that discontent but turn it into constructive action. So his supporters weren\u2019t able to win the primary race. They can still win the sort of vital structural reforms that will make politics more representative and accountable going forward. Sanders must continue to lead this fight. What he must not do is continue to fight Clinton. Instead he must enthusiastically and energetically support the Democratic Party nominee and urge all of his supporters to do the same. At the same point in 2008, large percentages of Clinton supporters said they wouldn\u2019t vote for Barack Obama if he became the Democratic nominee and many said they would support Republican John McCain instead, but those Clinton supporters eventually came around, in no small part because Clinton herself vociferously encouraged them to do so. How CNN's count put Clinton over the top Sanders and his supporters, myself included, have key differences with Clinton, and those differences won\u2019t go away. But they are undeniably dwarfed by the massive departure from core values and the lack of basic experience and competence that Trump represents. It\u2019s time for those who have even deep concerns about Clinton to come to their senses. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton agree on far, far more than they disagree.  And we must not allow Trump to become president. The Sanders revolution can and should continue on to the Democratic National Convention and beyond. But the Sanders campaign, in any formal sense of trying to win or wrest the nomination, should end. The sting like a bee phase of this primary is over. It is now time for Sanders and his supporters to float  magnanimously like butterflies \u2013 to champion Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump.

Kurt Bardella: Republican Party must appeal to women, millennials, and minorities or face extinction Such an evolution away from gridlock and fear is long overdue, he says What do women, minorities, young adults and college students have in common? Among other things, they are all constituencies alienated by the Republican Party and its ascendant candidate for the presidency, Donald Trump. The 2016 presidential election should have been an opportunity to improve the party\u2019s relationship with these constituencies, but now the party\u2019s entire identity has now been hijacked by Donald Trump\u2019s brand of misogyny. There was a time, at least rhetorically, when Republicans endeavored to advance the notion of being a \u201cBig Tent\u201d party. The party of inclusion and \u201cbig ideas.\u201d Unfortunately, instead of debating big ideas, the most vocal leaders in today\u2019s Republican Party spend more time talking about punishing women for exercising their legally protected rights and deporting everyone else. Now, let me just say for those that assume this is being written by a Democrat, that I am, in fact, a Republican.  I\u2019ve spent the bulk of my adult life working for Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-CA). As a millennial, I have grown up in a rapidly evolving culture that has created very different social and political environments than the ones my parents\u2019 generation encountered. As a result, I look around today and don\u2019t see a real place in the GOP for anyone who is pro-choice, supports gay marriage and women\u2019s rights, is fine with anyone using a bathroom, believes in climate change (aka science) but also believes in a limited government, a strong national defense and in the power of free enterprise. With President Trump or Clinton, gridlock could lift? I know many of my fellow Republicans want to see our party continue to evolve to be more inclusive of all Americans regardless of gender, age or race. We\u2019ve wasted the bulk of our congressional majority being angry and where has it gotten us? That\u2019s why I believe the time has come for the Republican Party and its leaders to stop operating from a place of fear. To stop bending to the will of the angriest among us who are impossible to please and instead embrace a policy agenda that will create more equality, fairness and prosperity for all. The frustration with the political establishment in Washington is visceral and real. \u201cAverage\u201d Americans feel as though Washington has abandoned them and sold them out to protect or further their own personal political aspirations. They are right. That\u2019s exactly what has happened. So many members of Congress cast votes, day in and day out, not because they believe in the merits of a bill but because they are fearful of how \u201cthe base\u201d will react. They are terrified of facing a primary challenge from a candidate who attacks them on their political left or right. Democrats blast GOP for leaving DC without passing Zika funds Unfortunately for the rest of us, appeasing that demographic comes at the expense of a relationship with women, minorities, young adults and college students, making it all but impossible to win a national general election. The effect of that fear has been a political system that now rewards gridlock and extreme rhetoric and locks out new voices who might re-animate the party. I know we can be so much more than just the party of the loudest and angriest. And in fact, if we don\u2019t evolve beyond being just that, there won\u2019t much of a party left by the presidential election of 2020.

Follow her on Twitter @tarasetmayer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Every time a bizarre statement highlights Trump's vulnerabilities, the task of conservatives weighing whether to back him gets more difficult, says Tara Setmayer. Paul Ryan is walking a tightrope, aiming for party unity and supporting conservative principles At a time when Donald Trump is trying to gain the support of conservative leaders like Paul Ryan and when they are trying to see if they can unite behind him, the flaws in his candidacy are on full display. On Friday, Trump had to address a report by the Washington Post that he posed as his own publicist, using a fake name, in speaking with reporters as he built his business empire in the 20th century and denied that it was his voice on a recording despite evidence to the contrary. We have yet to see his tax returns \u2013 which he says the public doesn\u2019t have a right to see \u2013 and you never quite know when the next outrageous comment or event will happen. Donald Trump faces his biggest test Whether it\u2019s white nationalist sympathizers ending up as delegates or most recently, his longtime butler\u2019s recently discovered racially violent rants on social media (which Trump\u2019s campaign disavowed Thursday), the volatility of Trump\u2019s candidacy is an ongoing liability. Speaker Ryan finds himself stuck between a rock and a political hard place. Ryan didn\u2019t ask to be put in this situation, just like he didn\u2019t ask to be thrust into the speaker\u2019s chair last fall, but he\u2019s in it now. The sudden demise of the Cruz campaign, leaving Trump as the presumptive nominee, happened so quickly it hit many in the party like a flash grenade with their proverbial ears still ringing, in the aftermath. This includes Ryan, who last week on CNN said he \u201cwasn\u2019t ready\u201d to support Trump just yet and for good reason. Is it too much to ask to expect common decency from your party\u2019s presidential nominee? Trump's 'enabler' charge against Clinton won't work Trump and his surrogates have sounded the clarion call for party unity and to fall in line behind him. Based on what exactly? A wing and a prayer?  What has Trump done to demonstrate his penchant for unity? His behavior thus far has been quite the opposite. Just days after becoming the presumptive nominee, Trump said on \u201cMeet The Press\u201d that he didn\u2019t need party unity to win. That\u2019s not exactly an olive branch. Yes, Donald Trump won a plurality of GOP primary votes, but close to 60% of Republican voters did not support him prior to Cruz and Kasich dropping out. Not to mention Trump\u2019s historic negatives among women and minorities \u2013 metrics that do not bode well for a Republican candidate heading into a general election. In a normal election cycle, unification would be a no-brainer. But as we all know, there\u2019s nothing normal about 2016.  How are conservatives supposed to unify behind someone who we feel is not only unfit for the office of the presidency, but doesn\u2019t share our values either?  This is not only a conundrum for many voters but potentially irreconcilable for even more. Why I am backing Donald Trump After the much-anticipated meeting between Speaker Ryan and Trump in Washington, Ryan emphasized the importance of bridging the gap on \u201ccommon core \u201d principles. No, not that \u201cCommon Core,\u201d but the core conservative values that have been the glue that has kept it all together for the GOP for decades: limited government, individual liberty, and adherence to constitutional checks and balances on executive authority, to name a few. Trump\u2019s positions on all of those issues are relatively unknown and certainly absent from Trump\u2019s free-flowing rants on the stump.  Although Ryan\u2019s comments seem to indicate he\u2019s warily warming up to Trump, significant differences still remain. Don't let 'Never Trump' become 'Ready for Hillary' Beyond Trump\u2019s petulant temperament, character deficit and consistent dishonesty, his \u201cflexibility\u201d on a litany of policies from threatening to abandon our longtime partners in Europe, admiration for strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin, dangerous protectionism (reminiscent of Hoover\u2019s disastrous policies of the 1920s) to tinkering with the party\u2019s pro-life platform are anathema to the foundation of the GOP.  Ryan\u2019s hesitation to throw his full-throttled support behind Trump is legitimate and heartfelt. There\u2019s more than just the political calculation here. Paul Ryan is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Jack Kemp, most famous for his enthusiasm of supply side economics and desire to create equality of opportunity for minorities in broken urban communities.  Kemp\u2019s legacy has been largely unfulfilled by other party leaders, but Ryan has made a concerted effort to push for Republican policies that address the needs of the lower class and urban centers.  He\u2019s attempted to build the elusive \u201cbig tent\u201d so desperately sought by the GOP, in practice not just rhetoric. For example, Ryan has written books, presented policy prescriptions for tax and entitlement reform and actively participated in joint ventures with Bob Woodson\u2019s Center for Neighborhood Enterprise to address the failed War on Poverty. How does that agenda square with Trump\u2019s brand of Republicanism? A Kemp or Reagan Republican is a very different breed than a Trump Republican, however that is eventually defined. Paul Ryan is walking a political tightrope with very little room for error.  The  venerable Cook Political Report has already downgraded GOP prospects in at least 10 House races.  Some of the GOP\u2019s 24 Senate seats up for re-election this year are also in play.  With GOP control of both houses at risk, the potential consequences of a Trump candidacy extend beyond this election cycle. Clearly, Ryan still needs cover in case Trump implodes or loses in a landslide in November. The four big questions about Donald Trump Trump surrogates often brag about Trump as a brand. Many of us find that very troubling. Conservatism isn\u2019t simply a brand.  It\u2019s a worldview. A set of principles that govern the way we raise our families, run our businesses, our basic way of life. A full-throttled endorsement of Trump means taking on his litany of transgressions from offensive statements against women, the disabled, immigrants and POWs, to his carousel of policy positions. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has already given us a preview of the coming attacks against Trump and GOP members who support him during a visceral attack from the Senate floor tying Republicans to Trump\u2019s disparaging comments about women and immigrants. This is just the beginning and Paul Ryan knows it. Jack Kemp once said, \u201cDemocracy without morality is impossible.\u201d  With a Trump/Clinton match-up in the offing, we\u2019ll soon find out if that still applies.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Lincoln scholar and author Harold Holzer has written and edited dozens of books on President Abraham Lincoln, including his most recent book, \u201cLincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion.\u201d Explore America\u2019s most dramatic presidential elections on CNN\u2019s \u201cRace for the White House\u201d Sundays at 9 p.m. ET. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. The 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates were short on substance but long on \"sound bites,\" Harold Holzer writes Abraham Lincoln ran an aggressive presidential campaign, secretly purchasing a newspaper to help his bid In the end, he and political rival Stephen A. Douglas made peace for the sake of the country \u201cIt\u2019s another 1860,\u201d some TV pundits have been exclaiming in their analyses of the raucous, mud-slinging presidential debates of 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas all over again.\u201d Well, not quite. Such comparisons conflate the long and turbulent rivalry between \u201cLong Abe\u201d and \u201cThe Little Giant,\u201d which originated on the brutal one-on-one political stump in rural Illinois in the 1830s, and endured in enmity for another 30 years. Douglas, a Democrat, favored Jacksonian economic policies, which stressed decentralization of banking as a way to spur opportunity for farmers. He also supported the Mexican-American War, even if the newly acquired territory it yielded might become ripe for slavery. Lincoln, a Whig (long before he became a Republican), opposed the war fiercely (possibly to his political detriment) and advocated not only for a national bank, but for \u201cinternal improvements\u201d \u2013 the building of roads, canals, bridges and rail lines, or what today we would call \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d These divisions were more than enough to fuel the Lincoln-Douglas competition, during which Douglas rose from Congress to the U.S. Senate, while Lincoln, whose national experience was limited to a single term in the House, limped afterward into a self-imposed political obscurity back home that lasted for almost five years. Then, in 1854, with the slavery issue roiling politics, Douglas, now a powerful Senate committee chairman, engineered passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The new law gave white voters in new Western territories the right to vote for themselves on whether to admit or ban slavery, with no voice, of course, given to enslaved people themselves. \u201cAroused,\u201d he said, as he never had been before, Lincoln came roaring back into the fray, arguing in speech after speech that slavery must be contained where it then existed and \u201cplaced on the course of ultimate extinction.\u201d Lincoln and Douglas emerged as national spokesmen for these intractably different viewpoints, and their clash climaxed during the Illinois Senate campaign of 1858 \u2013 with Lincoln challenging Douglas\u2019 bid for a third term \u2013 and the seven three-hour debates that \u201cset the prairies on fire.\u201d The first debates ever transcribed by stenographers, the marathons were printed in newspapers throughout the state, achieving a breathtaking immediacy that seemed as revolutionary in its time as today\u2019s tweets and at-home access to live debate telecasts. The debates were actually rather short on substance (slavery and conspiracy theories dominated), but were long on what today we would call \u201csound bites.\u201d On one occasion, Douglas accused Lincoln of hypocrisy on the issue of temperance, charging that he had once operated a \u201cgrocery\u201d store that sold hard liquor. If so, Lincoln drawled in retort, Douglas was surely his best customer. When Douglas added that Lincoln was disingenuously two-faced on the slavery issue (secretly favoring black equality), Lincoln famously shot back, \u201cIf I had another face, do you think I would wear this one?\u201d Lincoln, in turn, argued that Douglas violated the spirit of the founding fathers by denying people of color their inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and in fact was part of a vast right-wing conspiracy to make slavery national and permanent. Energized, the Republicans won the Illinois popular vote that year, but Senate elections then were decided in state legislatures, where Democrats retained a substantial advantage. Douglas won re-election, and Lincoln, beaten, worried that he might sink into obscurity again, this time perhaps forever. But Lincoln had a genius for what today we call public relations, and he soon dove back into the fight \u2013 this time with his eye on the biggest prize of all, the presidency, with Douglas looming as his likeliest opponent. A side of Lincoln you may not have seen Lincoln cannily organized support among Western Republicans, secretly bought a German-language newspaper to sing his praises to immigrant voters who might tilt such swing states as Illinois and Indiana, made a smash New York oratorical debut at Cooper Union in February 1860, and saw to the publication of those 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates, with friendly editing by Lincoln himself. The book became a best-seller. When the Republican National Committee chose Chicago as the site of the nominating convention, Lincoln became the home-state favorite son \u2013 the right man in the right place when the candidate expected to win the nod, U.S. Sen. William H. Seward of New York, faltered on the first ballot. Two votes later, the lesser-known Lincoln was the Republican nominee. Meanwhile, Douglas\u2019 march to the Democratic nomination hit a wall. Unlike Republicans, Democrats required their nominees to achieve two-thirds of the delegate votes. At its riotous convention in pro-slavery Charleston, South Carolina, Douglas failed to get the votes he needed. He simply wasn\u2019t conservative enough. Which president is the best of the best? Facing stalemate, Southerners walked out, started their own wing of the Democratic Party and nominated Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate. Douglas became the nominee of the Northern Democrats, while moderates, fearful that a Lincoln victory might split the country permanently, nominated John Bell under a new banner called the Constitutional Union Party. In the ensuing four-way race, Lincoln was almost unable to lose. On Election Day, he swept the North and won handily in the Electoral College, even though he amassed less than 40% of the popular vote. Might such a split divide the Republican Party in 2016, as it divided the Democrats in 1860? Certainly, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that if the upcoming GOP convention renounces a popular favorite, another schism might roil the party as it did when Lincoln ran. And don\u2019t forget that in the years since, Theodore Roosevelt, George Wallace, Ross Perot and Ralph Nader all mounted third-party challenges that arguably changed the outcome of a national race. The Confederate flag and Lincoln's reconciliation Is the emotion as high, and are the divisions as wide, today, as they were in 1860? Probably not, though we like to imagine so. But things are certainly boiling over, and at each presidential debate, as stakes widen and opportunities narrow, the drama only intensifies. But remember: As famous as the Lincoln-Douglas debates became, both in their own time and in American history, they took place during a Senate race, not a presidential campaign, and there was no sequel when the two protagonists ran against each other for the White House. Politics may have been tumultuous in the 19th century, but back then, presidential candidates simply did not campaign directly for the White House, much less face each other one-on-one in such undignified encounters. Lincoln stayed home and said nothing during the 1860 campaign. Douglas made one half-hearted campaign swing, using the excuse that he needed to visit his ailing mother. Retracing Lincoln's final hours And therein lies what one of this year\u2019s presidential candidates might call a \u201chuuuuuge\u201d difference: the tradition of silent presidential candidates! Here is another:  When Lincoln stood outside the U.S. Capitol on March 4, 1861, to deliver his inaugural address, he removed his already famous stovepipe hat and looked helplessly for a place to set it down while he spoke. From behind him came a hand and an offer. Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, whom Lincoln had defeated for the presidency, volunteered to hold his lifelong rival\u2019s topper while the new President took the oath of office. It was a gesture that helped unite the North to face the crisis yet to come. Will someone hold the new president\u2019s hat on January 20, 2017 \u2013 symbolically, of course? Time will tell.

He now runs a nonprofit in New York. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. A former investment banker says there's nothing wrong with giving paid speeches John MacIntosh says it's delivering entertainment for a price Dear Hillary: I had the pleasure of meeting your husband back in 2002 at the annual reception of a leading private equity firm. (I was the 30-something finance guy in the blue suit, medium height, medium build, brown hair, Ivy League grad. Maybe he mentioned me?) I still recall how he shook my hand, chatted insightfully with our small group for a few minutes and then wowed us by recognizing the obscure arrangement the jazz quartet was playing (although I always suspected the musicians had been asked to play it for just that purpose). As I\u2019m sure he told you, it was truly a remarkable evening. Anyway, it\u2019s ridiculous that the speeches-on-Wall-Street thing is becoming an issue for you in the primary so let me take the liberty of offering you some free campaign advice. Folks just don\u2019t seem to understand that money-for-speeches \u2013 while perhaps crass at times \u2013 is just good clean fun with no connection at all to the important issues of money in politics and the power of Wall Street. In fact, I think the whole thing would go from being a negative to a positive for your campaign if you made a few simple points: It\u2019s just show business. Every brand-name entertainer over 45 \u2013 singers, athletes, writers and politicians \u2013 cashes in one way or another because they have time on their hands yet still appeal to the well-heeled baby boomers who attend conferences, throw expensive parties and shell out for Vegas shows. The Wall Street firms who signed you up weren\u2019t thinking about how they could increase their power and influence \u2013 they have K Street and \u201csenior adviser\u201d sinecures for that \u2013 they just thought you\u2019d provide some good old-fashioned entertainment. (To tell you the truth, I would have preferred Keith Richards to your husband at that meeting in 2002, but I was not involved in the event planning, and he probably would have been too expensive anyway.) Is Trump for real? One question New Hampshire will answer Since you got paid for a service, there is no hint of corruption. Although the Supreme Court got it exactly backward in its Citizens United decision, the danger from corruption is greatest when there is no explicit quid pro quo. If you\u2019d been paid for doing nothing, people could rightly suspect you\u2019d feel some loyalty or future obligation to your paymasters. But you were paid to provide specific services as laid out in some very explicit contracts and you did it. Case closed. Your earnings reflect admirable commercial instincts. Americans appreciate a candidate with business acumen. Your speech-related earnings reflect your appreciation for the market and your belief in capitalism. Not to have taken millions in low-hanging speaking fees from easy marks would have been positively un-American. Even socialists should appreciate the extra joy \u2013 remember \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven\u201d \u2013 that you got taking money from people whom you may not particularly like. Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, you weren\u2019t fraternizing with the enemy \u2013 you were picking his pocket! Candidates win when they challenge big money's role You were just leaning in. While Bill was out making millions giving his speeches, were you supposed to stay back in Chappaqua knitting booties by the fire? What type of message would that send to hardworking women? And tell people that after your two terms as president, you plan to return to the speech circuit and command the same level of inflation-adjusted fees that male presidents have earned before you. It was a lot of fun. This is an opportunity to show that you know how to have a good time. Admit that while it was sometimes a grind to speak with (generally) boring people \u2013 from investment bankers to clinical pathologists \u2013 it was also exhilarating to find ways to seem fresh and new week after week. (How does one inspire dentists one day and realtors the next?) Recount a humorous anecdote or two about parrying awkward marital questions from a bond trader who\u2019d overindulged at the open bar. Debate coach: Only one candidate got an A You brought joy to others. Remind people that your audience was mostly those nameless professionals who huddle forgotten in the bottom 90% of the top 1%. The little people on the outside who, noses pressed to the glass, would otherwise never have had the chance to feel like insiders by shaking your hand and exchanging a few bon mots. Not rich enough to be courted as donors, not numerous enough to matter as voters, not powerful enough to be sought after for their influence, they are truly the unremarked forgotten of our political system. You should be proud to have a brought an hour or two of joy into their lives. Don\u2019t go negative. Even if all else fails, please resist the temptation to go negative. It\u2019s true you made more in a good week than Bernie Sanders has saved in his entire life, and he probably could not compete on the lecture circuit if he tried. To some that makes him a loser and you a winner. But even in a silly political season when the candidate who throws the most insults appears to win, there is no need to overreact by following others into the gutter. This speech thing is a tempest in a teapot that will soon blow over (particularly if you release the text of your speeches to prove that there is no smoking gun). Anyway, good luck in the election. You\u2019re going to be a great president. But if it doesn\u2019t work out, I hope you\u2019ll get back out on the circuit so maybe we\u2019ll have the chance to meet.

And it will not alter the growing sense among both Israelis and Palestinians that this latest wave of violence \u2013 unplanned, unprofessional, largely carried out by young Palestinians from areas Israel has controlled since 1967 \u2013 represents a new phase in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one that is harder to preempt, control and contain. But are both sides equally invested in controlling this recent violence? Clearly, Israel has a stake in doing so. The attacks are changing the rhythm of life in Israel\u2019s capital and presenting a hard-line Israeli government, one that is supposed to be adept at security matters, a seemingly impossible challenge. But it is less clear that the Palestinians, and especially the head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, have quite the same stake in controlling it. Having dealt with the late Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for more than a decade, I can say without much doubt that violence and terror were tools he never truly abandoned. Abbas, on the other hand, has never been a man of the gun. A year ago, for example, the head of Israel\u2019s Shin Bet security service reportedly testified flat out that Abbas doesn\u2019t encourage terror openly or under the table. Indeed, part of the reason that Hamas continues to resonate among Palestinians is precisely because Abbas isn\u2019t perceived to be a struggler, and so lacks street credibility. But Abbas may now see some merit in playing to the emotions of the street. The latest wave of Palestinian terror and violence, much of it being carried out using knives and vehicles, has created a situation where Abbas can neither restrain the killings nor engage in a systematic public or private campaign to condemn them. It\u2019s a new form of terror, one that carries both benefits and risks. For a start, Abbas has no real strategy on Palestinian statehood and is without allies. The reality is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has no real interest in a negotiated outcome that has Israel returning to the June 1967 borders or a division of Jerusalem. His plan is to bob and weave, stay in power, avoid a coalition crisis and wait out the end of the Obama administration in anticipation of a more pro-Israeli successor. The Arab states, meanwhile, are more focused on containing Iran and the Sunni jihadis than pushing Palestinian statehood. And the Americans have their hands full with Syria, Vladimir Putin and ISIS; the Obama administration has all but acknowledged that a breakthrough toward a two-state solution isn\u2019t possible. So, Abbas\u2019 campaign for international recognition of Palestinian statehood has stalled. But even as Abbas fails to make progress in foreign capitals, it is also clear that the current violence reflects his weakness and loss of authority domestically. Many of the attacks have been carried out by Palestinians too young to have clear memories of the disaster that was the second intifada, which took place from September 2000 until 2005. And to them, Abbas is nothing more than an empty suit. Indeed, a recent Palestinian poll suggests that Abbas would lose a presidential election to a Hamas candidate and that Palestinians have little faith in either Abbas or the Palestinian Authority. The poll showed two-thirds believing that an armed intifada better serves Palestinian goals than negotiations. The violence therefore reflects where the street is. With the political winds blowing in favor of violence, and no prospect of negotiations or ending the Israeli occupation, Abbas is now walking a fine line. He won\u2019t order Palestinian security forces to crush Palestinian protests, probably fearing that a general uprising or third intifada could expose his utter weakness and open opportunities for his Hamas rivals. But he also won\u2019t engage in a systematic campaign of condemnation, nor try to condition the public to see the risks of this terror, because he would lose what little authority and credibility he has. (And it is important to remember that Abbas anyway probably views these attacks fundamentally differently than the Israelis \u2013 as the desperate acts of deeply angry and frustrated youths, rather than straightforward terrorism). Finally, whatever the downsides of the almost daily attacks, Abbas knows that the violence serves to remind Israel and the international community that there\u2019s a price to be paid for maintaining the status quo. What clouds this picture further is that the recent violence is qualitatively different from previous waves. Unlike the mass suicide terror of Hamas or al-Aqsa brigades during the second intifada, these are deemed by most Palestinians \u2013 and perhaps many within the Arab world and even the international community \u2013 as unplanned acts born of frustration by young kids. That could make it more acceptable to Abbas, the Palestinian community and others who have warned of the boiling cauldron that the absence of a solution has created. None of this, of course, will change the balance of power on the ground, inject more urgency into the push for a two-state solution or ultimately benefit the Palestinian cause. Abbas is riding a tiger much as Arafat did during the second intifada. But his situation is infinitely worse \u2013 Arafat actually used the violence to press then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak to improve his terms for a settlement at the end of 2000 and the Americans to deepen their involvement. This time around, the Palestinian leader is unlikely to succeed at either. As a result of all this, Abbas may find himself weakened at home and abroad by terror attacks that he cannot ride to popularity, but that he has no ability to contain, either.

            "article_content": "Romney and Trump have not seen eye-to-eye over Russia, NATO and trade There's no indication any offer is forthcoming or Romney would accept it The meeting comes as Trump speaks to a series of Republicans who opposed his campaign at some point President-elect Donald Trump will meet this weekend with one of his fiercest critics: 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a discussion that could include the position of secretary of state. The two men are set to discuss \u201cgoverning moving forward\u201d and potentially a role for Romney in Trump\u2019s Cabinet,  a senior Republican source told CNN on Thursday. Romney has long told friends that he would like to serve in government again and the one job he is interested in is secretary of state, a senior Republican with knowledge of the transition tells CNN. The source says that Romney is meeting with Trump in part to discuss it. The former Massachusetts governor is being presented as a choice that would show Trump is looking for \u201cadults\u201d because he would bring a team of professionals along with him, the source said, adding that the nomination is being seen as a \u201cserious\u201d possibility. The meeting with Romney comes as concern about Rudy Giuliani\u2019s chances of confirmation continue \u2013 a factor, the source said, that has been discussed with Trump. It\u2019s also the latest in a series of Trump\u2019s conversations and encounters with Republicans who did not support his candidacy in an effort to reunite the GOP following a divisive election that fractured the party establishment. Trump is also maintaining a jam-packed schedule Thursday as the President-elect\u2019s team looks to tamp down reports of disarray and infighting within the transition effort, which has been slow to ramp up following Trump\u2019s shocking victory last week. One close friend expressed healthy skepticism that Romney would ever serve in the President-elect\u2019s Cabinet. Romney has often talked how his father, George, did not enjoy serving in President Richard Nixon\u2019s Cabinet. After McCain won in 2008, Romney told friends that he didn\u2019t want to go into McCain\u2019s Cabinet, if he won. \u201cTrump\u2019s Cabinet seems like an even lower probability,\u201d the friend said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say never, but I would be surprised.\u201d A Romney appointment would be a startling shift in the two men\u2019s relationship. One former Romney adviser was surprised by the meeting, but said of Romney, \u201che cares that much. He\u2019s a patriot. This isn\u2019t about Donald Trump.\u201d Another Romney ally added that the only position that would attract him would be secretary of state. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the economy guy, but look at his book. He is and was more involved in foreign policy issues. And he was right about everything from ISIS to Russia,\u201d the person said. But on Russia there is major disagreement \u2013 at least in attitude \u2013 between the two men. Romney, during his 2012 campaign, considered Russia an existential threat to the US, while Trump has emphasized the possibility of working closely with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Romney is pro-trade agreements and pro-NATO, while Trump has questioned the US-Europe relationship and campaigned against pacts like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific  Partnership. Trump repeatedly slammed the former GOP standard bearer during his ultimately successful bid for the a Republican nomination for his defeat to President Barack Obama, describing him in characteristically colorful terms as a failure. Romney returned fire, repeatedly and forcefully arguing that Trump was not qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. In an eviscerating speech last March, before Trump clinched the Republican nomination, Romney slammed Trump as a \u201ccon man,\u201d a \u201cphony\u201d and \u201ca fraud.\u201d Who could be in Trump\u2019s Cabinet? Romney refused to endorse Trump in the general election. He argued In favor of allowing the Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson onto the debate stage, but did not endorse him either. Romney also actively sought to recruit a third-party candidate to carry the conservative banner into the 2016 general election and continued to level heated criticism against Trump in the general election. In a June interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, Romney warned that Trump\u2019s presidency could usher in \u201ctrickle-down racism.\u201d Romney and Trump\u2019s meeting will come a week after Romney called to congratulate Trump on his victory, a call Trump tweeted was \u201cvery nice!\u201d Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Thursday she believes that Romney and Trump could work together. \u201cI think what happens with consensus-builders and good negotiators and successful businessmen who know you have to take the counts of many different people, rivals, allies, is that they find a way to work together,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cI think it will be a productive conversation.\u201d Trump is meeting Thursday with more than a half-dozen potential candidates for top administration posts, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Trump\u2019s transition spokesmen also announced Thursday he will name members of the so-called \u201clanding team\u201d of transition officials to work with US officials at the departments of State, Defense Justice and the the National Security Council. Mitt Romney: 'This is breaking my heart' Concerns about the slow pace of the transition effort have grown in recent days as US officials at various agencies said they had still not yet established contact with the Trump transition team. Why hasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s transition team called the Pentagon? Following the national security landing team announcement Friday, the transition team will also announce early next week the names of individuals who will lead the transition with economic agencies and domestic policy agencies and groups, RNC communications director Sean Spicer said on a conference call with reporters Thursday. In the eight days since Trump\u2019s victory, the President-elect replaced New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as chairman of the transition with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and a slew of transition officials who worked under Christie were subsequently booted from the transition effort. Trump is also scheduled to meet with his transition team for two hours on Friday to discuss their progress and go over potential appointments, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Thursday. \u201cMy transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA,\u201d Trump tweeted. My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA Miller declined Thursday to provide a timetable for cabinet appointments, stressing that the focus is on \u201cgetting it right,\u201d rather than an \u201carbitrary timetable,\u201d echoing the comments of Conway. \u201cIn the words of Vice President Biden just yesterday after meeting with Mr. Pence, nobody should expect the government to be formed overnight,\u201d Conway said Thursday morning on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cNobody is in a rush to do the wrong thing.\u201d Trump will seek ideas on his administration from nine \u201ctop shelf people\u201d he is set to meet with Thursday at Trump Tower, some of whom Miller said are \u201cup for cabinet positions\u201d \u2013 though he did not specify which ones. Trump has announced RNC chairman Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff and his campaign CEO Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor. As he focuses on filling key national security posts, Trump sought the counsel of 93-year-old former Secretary of State Kissinger. Trump met with Kissinger for a private meeting in May, but the hawkish former secretary of state has also advised Trump\u2019s presidential rival Hillary Clinton, who said she \u201crelied on his counsel\u201d during her time helming the State Department. Trump also met with Nikki Haley, the South Carolina governor who was deeply critical of Trump during the Republican primary, who is under consideration for the secretary of state post and other cabinet positions, according to a transition source. And continuing with the national security bend of the day, Trump was schedule to speak with Adm. Mike Rogers, the current director of the National Security Agency, and Gen Jack Keane, a retired four star general who advised Clinton in recent years. The President-elect will also meet with a pair of Fortune 500 CEOs, Oracle\u2019s Safra Catz and FedEx\u2019s Fred Smith, as well as Cincinnati Mayor Ken Blackwell and Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, who is under consideration to helm the Treasury Department. Trump also met Thursday afternoon in New York with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the first foreign head of state Trump met with in person since becoming president-elect. The Japanese prime minister told reporters after the meeting that he feels the two leaders will be able to maintain \u201ca relationship of trust.\u201d On the stump, Trump repeatedly argued that Japan should pay a larger share of the costs for US military bases on its soil and even suggested the country should shoulder a greater burden of its defense against the aggressive actions of North Korea and provocations from China.

            "article_content": "Clinton will have high-profile surrogates like Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders She faces high unfavorable ratings and needs to convince people they don't know the real Clinton Hillary Clinton\u2019s challenge this week is reintroducing herself to a country that has known her for decades and getting through to the millions of Americans who are convinced that they already know everything there is to know about the former secretary of state and first lady. Wasserman Schultz resigning as party leader The Democratic National Convention is her best opportunity to deliver a forceful case for her candidacy and draw a sharp contrast against Donald Trump. She will have to counter the stream of attacks that Trump and his surrogates threw her way at last week\u2019s GOP convention, and at the same time, make a fresh appeal to the large swath of the Democratic base that rejected her during the primaries and independent voters yet to pick a side. Celebs head to DNC, some to back Clinton, others to protest But even before it begins, Clinton\u2019s convention is mired in controversy. Inside the Clinton campaign's new smartphone app A slew of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee posted online this weekend raised questions about the DNC\u2019s impartiality and reinforced the idea that the Democratic establishment actively worked to submarine Bernie Sanders\u2019 insurgent candidacy. CNN/ORC poll: Trump leads Clinton Under fire, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday afternoon that she would resign from her position after the convention. The episode is an embarrassing distraction for the Democratic Party, as the Clinton campaign and its surrogates prepare to use the week to paint two starkly different visions between Clinton and Trump. Another distraction: the source of the hack. US officials suspect it came from a Russian cyber attack and the FBI said Monday it is investigating. The idea of Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia somehow involving itself in US politics is a story that is both serious and can also distract from Clinton\u2019s messaging plans. FBI investigating suspected Russian hack of DNC emails A Clinton official said the convention will highlight Clinton\u2019s years in public service and how she plans to fight for Americans from the White House. \u201cThe contrast between Donald Trump\u2019s convention where he \u2018alone can fix it\u2019 versus Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention is that we are stronger together,\u201d the official said. And the participation this week of Democratic leaders including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders alone should remind voters that Trump has not won over the support of major Republican leaders, such as former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as the 2012 GOP nominee, Mitt Romney, the official added. Obama\u2019s former senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said the two conventions this year are less about first impressions and more about making a second introduction. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly unique for Clinton and Trump because they\u2019re incredibly well-known,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cNormally when you get to the convention, the broader general election electorate pays attention to learn about you, so you\u2019re framing your narrative. But for Clinton and Trump, because they\u2019re so well-known, you\u2019re re-framing the narrative because there\u2019s not a lot of brand new information you will learn.\u201d Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s controversial tenure Clinton and Trump enter the general election with historically high unfavorable ratings. In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 55% of Americans said they have an unfavorable view of Clinton, while 59% said the same of Trump. Although Clinton is viewed slightly more favorably, she continues to suffer on the issue of trust: 65% said they do not believe Clinton is honest, a sharp rise from 50% who said the same in March 2015. Clinton and her campaign have grappled with a number of controversies, including her use of a private email server at the State Department as well as her handling of an attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said he is realistic about how difficult it is to remake Clinton\u2019s image. Still, the convention is a powerful stage from which Clinton can set out her vision, he said, and at the very least \u201cgive people a reason to feel better about her.\u201d \u201cThe reality is that she comes out of this nominating process with pretty high negatives and this is a chance for her to make her case in her own terms,\u201d said Gain, who advises the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be many more chances like this.\u201d The Republican convention last week laid bare a splintered party that continues to have deep misgivings about their nominee. Their four-day affair began with drama on the convention floor, when anti-Trump delegates unsuccessfully sought to mount a last-ditch rebellion against Trump. Then, in an extraordinary scene Wednesday night, the convention hall broke out into jeers as former presidential candidate Ted Cruz refused to explicitly endorse Trump during his prime-time speech. Clinton, too, has confronted her share of challenges in rallying the Democratic base. Over the last year, she has come under pressure from Sanders and his liberal supporters to embrace progressive policy priorities. And even after she had clinched the party\u2019s nomination, Sanders put off making an endorsement as he advocated for his signature policy proposals to be incorporated into the Democratic platform. After winning several key concessions, Sanders finally offered Clinton his formal backing last month. Pledging to help Clinton with the ultimate goal of defeating Trump, the self-described democratic socialist encouraged his supporters to follow suit and will speak Monday night here in Philadelphia. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, who initially endorsed Sanders and is now supporting Clinton, said these recent developments were significant in \u201csetting the stage for the two teams coming together.\u201d He stressed, however, the importance of Clinton continuing to embrace a progressive vision during the general election. \u201cThose ideas addressed the problems facing our country and they have tremendous resonance,\u201d Merkley said. \u201cAnd if you step away from them, they would be deflating the support and enthusiasm that folks worked so hard to create.\u201d Unlike Trump, who is still shunned by many in the Republican establishment, Clinton will have the help of the Democratic Party\u2019s highest-profile surrogates. Clinton is also about to pick up a coveted endorsement. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who considered running for the White House himself this year, will speak at the convention and offer Clinton his formal backing. The Republican-turned-independent business mogul could boost Clinton\u2019s appeal to independents and potentially deliver a powerful message to voters discouraged about the economy. And Clinton heads into Philadelphia with a political partner. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton newly named running-mate, on Saturday offered a preview of the contrast she and Kaine plan to draw against the Republican ticket. Kaine began his speech with a message about inclusion \u2014 in Spanish. \u201cBienvenidos a todos, bienvenidos a todos en nuestro pais, verdad, por que somos americanos, todos,\u201d said Kaine, which translates to: \u201cWelcome to everyone, welcome to everyone in our country, right, because we\u2019re all Americans, all of us.\u201d But the single most potent weapon Clinton has to unite Democrats may be Trump. Michael Podhorzer, political director of the AFL-CIO, said the convention will crystalize for many Democrats that the choice for the party is no longer between Clinton and Sanders. \u201cTrump is everything they don\u2019t want. They\u2019ve been, as in any primary process, buried in the back and forth\u201d between Clinton and Sanders, Podhorzer said. \u201cAnd now, they\u2019re looking around and saying oh my God, Trump could be president.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump's comments drew stern rebukes from members of both parties Trump suggested that the US shouldn't chide Turkey for violations of civil liberties Donald Trump, in a New York Times interview published Thursday, outlined a sharp break in US foreign policy tradition, suggesting the US wouldn\u2019t defend NATO allies like the Baltic states against Russian aggression if they haven\u2019t \u201cfulfilled their obligation to us.\u201d Donald Trump's dreadful night Trump has repeatedly made the case that most of NATO\u2019s 28-member countries are not making the requisite financial contributions for their common defense, and he\u2019s said in the past that \u201cthe US must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves.\u201d Throughout the interview, the Republican presidential nominee seemed to reject core assumptions of US military and foreign policy thinking \u2013 including foreign troop deployment and advocating for civil liberties \u2013 and argued for an unprecedented global retrenchment, frequently framing his argument in economic terms. Trump\u2019s comments were met with shock and anger in some quarters, drawing stern rebukes from members of both parties and prompting the White House to assuage anxious allies. They also made matters awkward for Trump\u2019s vice presidential choice, Mike Pence, who delivered a speech at the Republican National Convention within hours of the interview being posted online that contrasted in places with his running mate. At one point, Pence told the RNC audience that Trump would \u201cstand with our allies.\u201d \u201cWe cannot have four more years of apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends,\u201d Pence said. 7 takeaways from wild night at GOP convention Though Trump said, \u201cI would prefer to be able to continue\u201d existing international agreements, he later explained that \u201cthis is not 40 years ago.\u201d He also suggested that the massive expense of maintaining an international order that is contributing to trade losses for the US \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound very smart to me.\u201d \u201cWe are spending a fortune on a military in order to lose $800 billion,\u201d Trump said. Trump questioned the forward deployment of American troops when answering a question about the tension in the South China Sea. According to the Times interview, Trump explained that \u201cit will be a lot less expensive\u201d for the United States to deploy military assets domestically. What Trump says about NATO and what it actually does Trump was also asked about the recent attempted coup in Turkey, praising President Recep Erdogan \u201cfor being able to turn that around.\u201d And Trump suggested that the US shouldn\u2019t chide Erdogan\u2019s administration about potential violations of civil liberties because \u201cwhen the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don\u2019t think we are a very good messenger.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we have the right to lecture,\u201d he said. NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, in an unusual statement about American domestic politics, responded to Trump\u2019s comments with a call for solidarity. \u201cI will not interfere in the US election campaign, but what I can do is say what matters for NATO,\u201d Stoltenberg said in a statement to CNN. \u201cSolidarity among Allies is a key value for NATO. This is good for European security and good for US security. We defend one another.\u201d Toomas Hendrik, president of NATO member Estonia, appeared to respond to Trump\u2019s comments on Twitter, though he didn\u2019t mention the GOP nominee by name. \u201cEstonia is (one) of 5 NATO allies in Europe to meet its 2% def expenditures commitment,\u201d Hendrik tweeted. \u201cFought, with no caveats, in NATO\u2019s sole Art. 5 op. in Afg.\u201d The people in charge of NATO's future White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday that the United States\u2019 commitment to the mutual defense pact is \u201cironclad.\u201d \u201cThis is a longstanding commitment that has been strengthened under the leadership of President Obama,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThere should be no mistake or miscalculation made about this country\u2019s commitment to our country\u2019s transatlantic alliance.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign put out a statement early Thursday morning following the publication of Trump\u2019s interview, slamming his remarks and saying, \u201cIt is fair to assume that Vladimir Putin is rooting for a Trump presidency.\u201d \u201cFor decades, the United States has given an ironclad guarantee to our NATO allies: we will come to their defense if they are attacked, just as they came to our defense after 9/11. Donald Trump was asked if he would honor that guarantee. He said\u2026 maybe, maybe not,\u201d Clinton said. The former secretary of state continued, \u201cRonald Reagan would be ashamed. Harry Truman would be ashamed. Republicans, Democrats and Independents who help build NATO into the most successful military alliance in history would all come to the same conclusion: Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit and fundamentally ill-prepared to be our Commander in Chief.\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who has been pegged as a possible Clinton running mate, said he was \u201cstunned\u201d by Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cWhen you say to an ally who you have a treaty obligation to defend, \u2018Eh, we\u2019re not sure we will,\u2019 that\u2019s a very dangerous thing,\u201d Kaine said at a press conference on Thursday. Sen. Lindsey Grahham, a South Carolina Republican who challenged Trump in the Republican primaries, also denounced the GOP nominee\u2019s comments. \u201cStatements like these make the world more dangerous and the United States less safe,\u201d Graham said in a statement. \u201cThe Republican nominee for President is essentially telling the Russians and other bad actors that the United States is not fully committed to supporting the NATO alliance.\u201d Graham, who last month urged Republicans to rescind their endorsements of the nominee, said he hopes Trump will \u201ccorrect\u201d his remarks in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who is publicly supporting Trump and who spoke at the RNC earlier this week, differed with Trump\u2019s NATO comments Thursday. He told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that the US is in the trans-Atlantic military alliance \u201cbecause it\u2019s in our national security interest.\u201d \u201cWe want to strengthen NATO and strengthen our common defenses,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother part of strengthening it is making clear we\u2019re going to stand by our security pledge.\u201d Not doing so, he continued, \u201cdoesn\u2019t make it less likely to get into a hot war, it ultimately makes it more likely.\u201d In an interview with Fox News on Thursday morning, Pence said he hadn\u2019t seen \u201cthe exact context\u201d of the comments on NATO, but the Indiana governor nevertheless didn\u2019t take issue with Trump\u2019s position. \u201cI think Donald Trump\u2019s position very broadly with regard to our allies and with regard to treaty obligations and NATO is that it\u2019s time for our allies to begin to pay their fair share. It\u2019s time for people to begin to step up,\u201d Pence said. Farage reacts to Trump's proposed NATO agenda He added, \u201cThe NATO alliance since World War II has been a mutual defense alliance and I have every confidence that Donald Trump will see to it that the United States of America stands by the allies and lives up to the treaty obligation.\u201d Trump also found a sympathetic ear in Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK\u2019s Independence Party and one of the most vocal supporters of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. \u201cI think the American military over the last few years has been pretty unhappy with their NATO allies, who have just kept cutting, cutting, cutting their defense spending,\u201d Farage said, adding that NATO was \u201ca wonderful vehicle to keep peace in Europe for 60, 70 years.\u201d \u201cBut NATO now does need to redefine itself,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it for? We don\u2019t have the Warsaw Pact. I\u2019m pro-NATO. I\u2019m pro-cooperation. But it\u2019s not a bad thing that we reassess what it\u2019s for.\u201d CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr and Tal Kopan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Until recently, Chris Barron was very critical of Donald Trump Now he hopes to convince gay Republicans to support their presumptive nominee A prominent gay Republican is coordinating an effort to mobilize a coalition of conservative lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) voters in support of Donald Trump, CNN has learned, a project that has intensified in the wake of a terrorist attack at a gay club in Orlando, Florida. Chris Barron, the former president of the now-defunct gay conservative group GOProud, was recently a vocal Trump critic, but now is circulating a letter among like-minded members of the LGBT community, arguing that Republican Trump will better-suited to protect them from acts of extremism as president than Democrat Hillary Clinton. \u201cI have no doubt that Donald Trump would be better for LGBT Americans,\u201d Barron said in an interview with CNN. \u201cHillary Clinton wants to continue a reckless foreign policy that has made the world less safe for all Americans, including LGBT Americans. She can find plenty of time to crucify Christians in the U.S. for perceived anti-gay bias, but when we\u2019ve got ISIS throwing gay people off of buildings, when we have Muslim states that are prescribing the death penalty for people who are gay, I would think this would be something that a friend of the LGBT community would be able to speak out on, and Hillary Clinton finds it unable to do so.\u201d Barron\u2019s campaign on Trump\u2019s behalf will be an uphill battle, as polling shows that most LGBT voters remain skeptical of Republicans, whose officials party platform opposes same-sex marriage. Gay voters overwhelmingly supported President Obama in 2012, according to CNN\u2019s national exit poll. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest interest group representing LGBT Americans, has formally condemned Trump\u2019s rhetoric on a range of issues. Trump earlier this year told the Christian Broadcasting Network that they can \u201ctrust\u201d him to defend \u201ctraditional marriage.\u201d He has said that he believes marriage policy should be determined state-by-state, but he also said acknowledged that little could be done to change it in the wake of last year\u2019s Supreme Court case, which effectively tore down state bans on same-sex marriage nationwide. Before entering politics, Trump celebrated same-sex unions, including a civil partnership of singer Elton John. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for them,\u201d Trump wrote in a congratulatory note in 2005. \u201cIf two people dig each other, they dig each other.\u201d On Monday, both Clinton and Trump expressed support for LGBT Americans when they addressed the terror attack at Pulse, an Orlando night club, that left 49 dead and 53 wounded. Clinton invoked the phrase \u201cradical jihadists,\u201d when referring to the fight against ISIS, and called for unity in fighting terrorism. Trump reiterated his call for banning Muslims from entering the United States, but also made a direct appeal to the LGBT community. Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs. \u201cOur nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando\u2019s LGBT community,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have been through something that nobody could ever experience. A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but because he wanted to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation. It\u2019s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as nation. It\u2019s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.\u201d President of @HRC goes off on Trump: It\u2019s shameful and disgusting what Donald Trump did today  https://t.co/nd49zedYmp While Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin condemned Trump\u2019s remarks for what he said about Muslims, Barron said that Trump\u2019s remarks in defense of LGBT Americans was \u201cgame-changer\u201d for his effort to rally gay Republicans around the presumptive nominee. Barron declined to share a list of potential signatories to his coalition letter in support of Trump, although other gay Republicans confirmed there was a draft letter circulating. Barron, however, is an unlikely leader of a pro-Trump movement, and he has a mixed history with the mogul. In 2011, as president of GOProud, Barron coordinated a successful campaign to secure Trump a speaking slot at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the nation\u2019s largest annual gathering of right-wing activists. The address was Trump\u2019s first major speech to the conservative movement, and in many ways launched his political career. But four years later, when Trump launched his campaign for president, Barron said he regretted ever inviting Trump to speak and giving him such a prominent platform. He staunchly opposed to Trump\u2019s candidacy throughout the Republican primaries. Over a period of several months, Barron posted anti-Trump messages on Twitter, calling his supporters \u201cidiots\u201d and \u201cmorons.\u201d He called Trump a \u201csociopath,\u201d and in one post, Barron compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, writing, \u201cThe giant police state Trump supports would make Hitler blush.\u201d And now, full circle, Barron is back on the Trump Train. Trump > Hillary pic.twitter.com/GHNtMqtjuH \u201cFrankly, there were issues where I disagreed with Donald Trump and still do. But elections are always about choices, and the choice this election is that either Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president of the United States or Donald Trump is, and for me, that\u2019s a no-brainer, that\u2019s an easy one. It should be Donald Trump,\u201d Barron said. \u201cLots of people said lots of things during the primary process on all sides of it. Certainly what I said, yeah, it got incredibly heated. Was I alone in that? No, hell no. Was I the only Republican who said things about the Trump during the primaries that is now supporting him? Absolutely not.\u201d Not all gay Republicans in leadership positions are as convinced. The Log Cabin Republicans, the nation\u2019s oldest and largest group of gay Republicans, has yet to endorse the presumptive nominee. \u201cThere are reservations some members of our national board of directors have,\u201d said Log Cabin Republican President Gregory T. Angelo. \u201cI would want assurances that Mr. Trump wouldn\u2019t work to roll back advances we\u2019ve made in LGBT equality, specifically on the marriage equality issue.\u201d Angelo, who last year called Trump \u201cthe most gay-friendly Republican nominee for president ever,\u201d sent Trump a letter on behalf of the Log Cabin Republicans requesting a meeting in November, but his staff has yet to respond. The organization won\u2019t make a decision about a formal endorsement until a meeting is held. Robert Kabel, a gay Republican National Committee delegate from Washington, D.C., said he was still withholding judgment on whether to vote for Trump in November, citing the candidate\u2019s recent remarks that a judge overseeing a case involving Trump University would not be capable of doing his job because of his \u201cMexican heritage.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s still shaking out. I\u2019m with a lot of Republicans who are very troubled by his attack on the judge and the racist nature of that. It\u2019s very troubling,\u201d Kabel said. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping that he takes advice from people who know how to run presidential campaigns and get on message and stop all this name calling and fighting Republicans. If he can get on message and start talking about issues that I care about, then we\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d Bruce Carroll, a popular conservative blogger who uses the alias @GayPatriot on Twitter, said he still won\u2019t support Trump even though the primaries are over. \u201cI won\u2019t vote for Trump even if he winds up being the only name on the ballot,\u201d Carroll told CNN. \u201cI am not going to be an enabler of a racist, anti-Constitutional, authoritarian Trump regime.\u201d Still, Angelo was encouraged by what he heard in Trump\u2019s speech Monday. \u201cThat was historic. Have we ever had a Republican nominee for president who used the phrase, \u2018LGBT community,\u2019 let alone used a major policy address as an opportunity to stand in solidarity with the country\u2019s LGBT community? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Angelo said. \u201cEverything Trump has done and said in regard to the LGBT community, even before he ran for president, has indicated that he would do no harm if not be an ally.\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not directly address emailed questions about whether the campaign was coordinating or meeting with groups of LGBT conservatives, but provided a statement, saying, \u201cMr. Trump continues his outreach to coalitions and communities all over the country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "CNN's David Gregory talked to Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine about the Sanders effect on Democrats Kaine said Trump's unpredictability has the possibility to change the electoral map Virginia\u2019s Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, often mentioned as a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton, warns that party discord may hurt the likely nominee of the party if unity isn\u2019t achieved soon. In an  interview for my podcast, I asked whether the Democratic primary fight has become harmful to Clinton. Kaine said, \u201cWe are getting near that point,\u201d but added he was confident Sanders and his supporters would unify. \u201cThere will be a time when he (Sanders) will be working very hard to unify the party and support Hillary.\u201d Kaine, the former governor of a swing state, was a finalist in the veepstakes back in 2008, but predicted then he wouldn\u2019t be selected. He went on to become Democratic National Committee chairman before his election to the Senate. He\u2019s not anticipating to be on the Democratic ticket with Clinton in 2016, either. \u201cMy gut doesn\u2019t feel much differently this time than last\u201d he said. Kaine stressed, however, he feels this is an \u201cexistential\u201d election with a stark choice between Clinton and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Kaine is a key surrogate for Clinton, campaigning in the South and as part of the Clinton team\u2019s outreach to Hispanic voters. He speaks fluent Spanish and worked as a Catholic missionary in Honduras. While some in the party have suggested he may not be the best attack dog against Trump, Kaine is confident he knows how to draw distinctions with other candidates. But don\u2019t look for bluster and name-calling from Kaine; he doesn\u2019t think those tacticts always work. \u201cIf what people want is the angriest guy or the biggest name-caller, I wouldn\u2019t have been elected to the city council in 1994.\u201d Speaking of Sanders and his complaints about the Democratic primary rules, Kaine, the former DNC chairman, argued the Vermont senator has valid critiques, including the role superdelegates play. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that. I tried to change it when I was DNC chair, but some of the people on Bernie\u2019s campaign were instrumental in creating that,\u201d he said. Kaine adds there is much to be learned from the Sanders candidacy about how the Democratic Party is being pulled apart over visions of economic success.  The division, he says, is between pro-growth Democrats like himself and pro-regulation, redistributionist Democrats like Sanders. \u201cWe are starting to have a debate that we need to have about how we can have growth that is shared.\u201d As for Trump, Kaine warns his party it should have \u201czero complacency.\u201d \u201cWith Trump I\u2019ve always thought it would be unpredictable. You have to assume going in there could be places where we assume victory that suddenly we have to work harder for, but there are also places where the Republicans have assumed victory in the past that suddenly come onto the map and come into play because of Trump. So his candidacy puts a lot of crosswinds into an electoral map that seemed kind of stable.\u201d Kaine is a man of deep faith and as the author of a book on the subject, I asked him how discussion of faith in politics could become less divisive and more revealing. \u201cWhat I think we can do in politics is if we just share with each other what motivates us,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to convince you to be like me, but will you let me share with you what motivates me and then you share with me what motivates you. That\u2019s not divisive. That\u2019s actually instructive.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats are gleeful at the prospect of tying GOP Sen. Mark Kirk to Trump Kirk has long defied expectations for Republican politicians in the blue state Whether he likes it or not, Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk has a new running mate: Donald Trump. For both Kirk and his challenger, Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, much of their campaign strategy hinges on Trump, now the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee for president. Nightcap: Ryan vs. Trump in a high-stakes GOP power struggle | Sign up Republicans are worried that Kirk, one of the most vulnerable GOP senators, could be dragged down by the divisive billionaire and help Democrats, who only need to win five seats to flip the Senate. It\u2019s a scenario that\u2019s repeating itself in Senate races all over the map this cycle. Trump has been an omnipresent part of Democrats\u2019 rallying (and fundraising) cries, and with campaigns and spending groups looking for ways to tie Republican incumbents to Trump. Kirk is trying to walk a narrow path. He is distancing himself himself from Trump\u2019s policies and rhetoric, but also has said he will back Trump if he was the nominee and suggested Trump could even help the Republican Party. Asked in an interview with CNN last week if he\u2019d support Trump for president, Kirk said: \u201cCertainly, if he\u2019s the nominee.\u201d Given the opportunity to revise his comments after Trump\u2019s win in Indiana, Kirk\u2019s campaign declined. Kirk said in that interview that even as he runs against many of Trump\u2019s positions, specifically citing an \u201cisolationist\u201d foreign policy debuted last week, he is comfortable sharing a ticket with the mogul. He even said Trump might help the GOP brand down the line. Democrats tie Trump to vulnerable GOP candidates \u201cDonald Trump is kind of a riverboat gamble,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cHe won the Illinois primary, in this case we have seen the Republican vote up and the Democratic vote down, so it looks like it\u2019s a net benefit.\u201d That embrace is catnip for Duckworth and Democrats, who are more than happy to tie Kirk to Trump. \u201cI think that Donald Trump is such a polarizing figure and it\u2019s really amazing to me that Mark Kirk has said he will support Donald Trump and that has been helpful, honestly,\u201d Duckworth said in an interview. \u201cPeople see Donald Trump has made all these racist and misogynist statements and so has Mark Kirk, and that allows us to draw a distinction.\u201d On paper, Kirk\u2019s seat looks like an easy takeover for Democrats. Illinois has voted solidly Democratic in presidential elections since 1992, and Kirk barely eked out a win by less than 60,000 votes in the Republican wave election of 2010. He\u2019s lagged behind Duckworth in fundraising and a recent ad buy by the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the fall in five states excluded Illinois, Politico reported. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee also skipped Illinois in fall ad reservations, though, focusing on battleground states in the presidential race, which will likely be more expensive as the year goes on. Kirk himself jokes about rumors of his demise having long followed his career. The GOP resistance to Donald Trump \u201cOften times, just to upset (Sen.) John McCain, I remind him in the last election where we shared the ballot together, I ran 16 points ahead of him,\u201d Kirk said in an interview, referring to the 2008 presidential race and his congressional campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve always run way ahead of the Republican ballot.\u201d He told CNN he will be able to withstand the Trump effect. \u201cThese days I\u2019m probably the best-positioned Republican to weather the institution of Trumpism because I have been voting pro-gay rights and against the gun lobby and solidly pro-choice,\u201d Kirk said, despite the fact he will support a Trump nomination. Kirk has been endorsed by the pro-gay rights Human Rights Campaign and is also the rare Senate Republican to embrace President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. GOP leaders have refused to hold a hearing or vote on the nominee, but Kirk is using the issue to show his independence from his party. He was the first Republican senator to meet with Garland and called out his own party\u2019s leadership for not voting on the nomination. Former Illinois GOP Chairman Pat Brady called Kirk\u2019s move on the nomination \u201csmart,\u201d even as Trump on top of the ticket would be a \u201chuge concern.\u201d Duckworth and Illinois Democrats have also been trying to tie Kirk to Trump while calling attention to past gaffes, like when Kirk said he would work on improving diversity and outcomes \u201cso that the black community is not the one we drive faster through\u201d in a 2015 interview. And they aren\u2019t letting Kirk off the hook on the Garland issue. Duckworth\u2019s campaign said he needed to do more than simply meet with the nominee and praise him, saying he should push party leaders to confirm Garland. And Obama gave a strong speech chastising Republicans for their inaction on Garland \u2013 delivered at the University of Chicago Law School. The numbers aren\u2019t great for Kirk. He would likely have to strongly outperform Trump in order to win. Trump trailed Clinton by 13 points in a CNN/ORC national poll this week in a hypothetical match-up. Kirk\u2019s own campaign released an internal poll last month showing him down by 3 percentage points but within the margin of error, a move many strategists read as an attempt to signal to donors and national groups the race remains close to prevent donors from abandoning the incumbent. But Kirk has shown the ability to beat the political odds before. \u201cKirk is always supposed to lose,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIn bad years, he performs very well.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It's unclear just what those disaffected Republican voters will do Clinton has already started making her appeal to Republicans who can't stomach the idea of voting for Trump Lisa Bowers, a Republican voter in New Hampshire, grew hesitant when asked the question: If the race comes down to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, who would you vote for? \u201cHonestly,\u201d she paused, \u201cI\u2019d vote for Hillary Clinton. At least with her, you kind of know what you\u2019re dealing with. He\u2019s just a loose cannon.\u201d That was in December, when Bowers, 41, was sitting in the audience waiting for Jeb Bush to hold a town hall. Months have passed. Reached Tuesday night, just as Trump was barreling towards the nomination following a decisive win in Indiana, Bowers said she\u2019s done a lot more research on the two candidates. \u201cAt this point, I would absolutely still vote for Hillary Clinton over Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be that, or not vote at all \u2013 and I\u2019ve never not voted.\u201d Bowers is one of many in the GOP facing an uncomfortable decision. A new CNN/ORC poll shows that one-third of Republicans would be dissatisfied or upset if Trump becomes the nominee \u2013 an all-but-certain fate now that Ted Cruz has dropped out of the race. It\u2019s unclear just what those disaffected Republican voters will do. Some say they\u2019ll begrudgingly support the likely nominee. Others will simply stay at home or write in a candidate. Some, like Bowers, say they\u2019ll cast a vote for what they consider the lesser of two evils. \u201cI not a big Hillary Clinton fan,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cBut she has a balance, and Trump doesn\u2019t.\u201d Clinton has already started making her appeal to Republicans who can\u2019t stomach the idea of voting for Trump \u2013 or \u201cthoughtful Republicans\u201d as she calls them. She\u2019s aiming to paint the billionaire as a divisive figure while branding herself as the candidate who can bring more people together, even across party lines. Last week in Philadelphia, the Democratic front-runner called for the country to unite against candidates who \u201cpit Americans against each other.\u201d \u201cIf you are a Democrat, an independent or a thoughtful Republican, you know their approach is not going to build an America where we increase opportunity or decrease inequality,\u201d she said. Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon called these voters \u201creasonable\u201d Republicans on Monday. Talking to reporters on a press bus, Fallon said a \u201cbroad call for coming together\u201d is a message that could appeal to Republicans who are turned off by the \u201cpolarizing\u201d effect of their party\u2019s standard-bearer. More specifically, the campaign plans to focus on the same issues that it\u2019s been pushing the past six months \u2013 like infrastructure investments, pay equity, a minimum wage increase and gun control. Such issues have seen support from at least some right-leaning voters. Clinton aides and confidants also expect a Republicans-for-Hillary effort, where GOP businessmen and high-profile donors could back the former secretary of state over Trump. One high-profile Republican has already said he\u2019ll support Clinton. Mark Salter, a former longtime aide to Arizona Sen. and 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain, has been aggressively advocating against Trump. He\u2019s taken to Twitter and his monthly column for Real Clear Politics to assail the candidate. In an interview on Tuesday, he described Clinton as the \u201cleast reckless\u201d option between the two. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t said she\u2019d ban all Muslims; he did. She hasn\u2019t said she\u2019d like to see other countries acquire nuclear weapons; he did,\u201d Salter said. \u201cShe is a more conservative choice, that\u2019s indisputable.\u201d Asked if there\u2019s anything Trump can do to woo back those Republicans, Salter said he would need \u201ca personality transplant.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s incapable,\u201d Salter said. \u201cHe\u2019d have to stop being Donald Trump.\u201d At the same time, Trump has peeled off a sizable amount of Democratic voters and unearthed voters who\u2019ve never cast a ballot before. They\u2019re drawn to his outsider status, his forceful talk on trade and his rebellious tone against special interests and lobbyists. With that said, Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic member of the South Carolina House and CNN political commentator, thinks Clinton will have the best luck with white Republican women and Republicans who are wary of Trump\u2019s not-so-traditional foreign policy views. \u201cFor these Republicans, it\u2019s not so much a Democrat vs. Republican decision, as much as it is question of whether they want a leader of the free world that has no there there,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cThere\u2019s an entire wing of the Republican Party who understands what it means to protect our interests around the world and not pull back into this pre-WWII isolationism.\u201d But many Republicans have been less clear about how they\u2019ll vote in November, despite being hesitant about backing Trump. Cruz made headlines when he refused to say earlier this week whether he\u2019d support the billionaire as the nominee. Jeb Bush, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel, wouldn\u2019t say whether he\u2019d support Trump, but described him as unserious and ill-prepared for president. Republicans coordinated this spring to launch a late attempt to stop Trump from clinching the nomination \u2013 a movement dubbed #NeverTrump \u2013 with groups spending money in states to stall the candidate\u2019s accumulation of delegates. But as evidenced Tuesday night, the effort failed. Boosted by Trump\u2019s dominating victory in Indiana, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski brushed off the #NeverTrump movement and called for party unity. \u201cI think all that\u2019s a passing fad,\u201d he told reporters at Trump Tower, before Cruz announced he was dropping out. \u201cI think right now most of the people understand that Donald Trump is going to be nominee, whether they like it or not.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to bring everyone together and make sure that there\u2019s one focus, and that focus is ensuring a Republican controls the White House,\u201d he added. Trump\u2019s allies believe many Republicans will warm to Trump eventually \u2013 mostly out of a shared and overriding dislike for Clinton, who, like Trump, has negative favorability ratings. Jesse Benton, co-chairman of Great America PAC, a pro-Trump group, said Trump may not be able to rally the Republican establishment leaders behind him but he\u2019s confident that Trump can get traditional Republican voters on his side. \u201cGive it a couple months of Trump being the presidential nominee without serious opposition and allow Republicans to focus their fire on Clinton,\u201d Benton said. \u201cAnd I bet those numbers will change.\u201d Some signs of unity could already be seen on Tuesday night. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted a show of support for Trump after Cruz dropped out. \u201c@realDonaldTrump will be presumtive @GOP nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton.\u201d .@realDonaldTrump will be presumptive @GOP nominee, we all need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton #NeverClinton Earlier Tuesday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose own presidential campaign foundered last year after trying to take down Trump, said he\u2019ll support Trump as the nominee even if he\u2019s \u201cnot happy about it.\u201d \u201cI would vote for him over Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. It happens every cycle. Voters and high-profile figures in politics pledge not to back the nominee but eventually many of them rally around the candidate. But Tim Miller, an adviser to the anti-Trump group Our Principles PAC, whose resume also includes leading an anti-Clinton group two years ago, said both candidates this time are positioned to repel a chunk of the electorate. \u201cI suspect there will be some rallying behind Trump but I suspect he will bring about a uniquely new, opposite reaction, where people will be disgusted with him in the next six months of what I expect to be an erratic general election,\u201d Miller said. At the same time, Miller cast doubt on the notion that Clinton can attract enough Republican voters to make a difference in the race, saying her effort to be seen as a unifier won\u2019t \u201cpass the smell test for Republicans.\u201d As for Miller himself, he\u2019s planning on writing someone else in. \u201cI would never vote for Hillary, ever,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI can take neither and not win but still maintain dignity, which I think is important.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court sent the challenge to Obamacare's contraceptive mandate back to a lower court The decision was unanimous The Supreme Court on Monday avoided issuing a major ruling on a challenge brought by religiously affiliated non-profit groups to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate. The justices, in a unanimous decision, wrote that they were not deciding the case on the merits but instead sent the case back down to the lower courts for opposing parties to work out a compromise. \u201cThe court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\u201d the justices wrote, adding that \u201cgiven the gravity of the dispute\u201d and the fact that the parties have clarified their positions during the course of the litigation the parties should be able to \u201carrive at an approach.\u201d The decision to send the case back to the appellate level appears to be a direct impact of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in February. Scalia, a stalwart conservative, would likely have ruled against the Obama administration. The court currently has four justices appointed by Republican presidents and four by Democrats. \u201cIt seems pretty clear that this is a compromise born out of an eight-justice court, where the justices avoid saying anything on the merits and try to make the case go away,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, a CNN contributor and a professor of law at American University Washington College of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve punted since Scalia\u2019s death, but it may well be the most brazen one.\u201d The White House has argued that the divided court and prospect for 4-4 rulings on major cases is a primary reason why the Senate should act on President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia\u2019s seat. Senate Republicans have no plans to hold hearings or vote on Garland\u2019s nomination before the November election. In an interview with BuzzFeed Monday, President Barack Obama suggested a fully staffed Supreme Court would have ruled differently. \u201cI won\u2019t speculate as to why they punted, but my suspicion is if we have nine Supreme Court justices instead of eight we might have had a different outcome,\u201d he said. This was the fourth time the Supreme Court heard a challenge to the signature legislative achievement of the Obama administration, and the second case challenging the contraception mandate. In 2014, the court ruled in favor of closely held for-profit companies like Hobby Lobby that objected to providing certain contraceptives. The challenge to Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate came from religiously affiliated non-profit groups, including the Little Sisters of the Poor, who object to having to provide \u201cabortifacients and contraceptives\u201d to their employees. The Obama administration offered the groups an accommodation meant to respect their religious liberty concerns, but the groups say that it is not good enough and still makes them complicit in committing a sin. They argue the accommodation forces them to violate their religious beliefs or pay ruinous fines in violation of federal law. Obama said the administration is \u201cproperly accommodating religious institutions\u201d who object to providing contraception coverage for their employees. The \u201cpractical effect\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was that women will \u201cstill continue to get contraception if they are getting health insurance,\u201d he told BuzzFeed. The decision came as a disappointment to some women\u2019s rights groups. \u201cIn punting today, the Supreme court only forces women and families to wait longer to learn who in this country has the \u2018right\u2019 to interfere with a woman\u2019s personal health care decisions,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. Mark Rienzi, a lawyer for the Little Sisters of the Poor, called the decision a \u201cwin\u201d for his clients and other plaintiffs. \u201cThere is still work to be done, but today\u2019s decision indicates that we will ultimately prevail in court,\u2019 he said in a statement. \u201cThe Little Sisters deserve more than a victory in court,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. \u201cThe Sisters deserve relief from this mandate, and an end to this ordeal. The administration should resolve this as soon as possible so the Sisters can go on serving the poor in peace as they have for so long. I am proud to stand with the Sisters, and all those who work every day to protect religious liberty.\u201d In its ruling Monday, the court said it is not deciding whether the religious exercise of the challengers has been substantially \u201cburdened.\u201d \u201cWhen all is said and done, the challengers may well get what they want \u2013 not having to directly provide contraceptive coverage against their religious beliefs,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cBut if the court gets its way, that will be the result of a pragmatic compromise, not a legal ruling about the balance between individual rights and religious freedom.\u201d At oral arguments in March, the justices seemed divided and a few days later issued an unusual order for more briefs suggesting that they were searching for a compromise. In an opinion concurring with today\u2019s decision Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg emphasized the impact of the supplemental briefs. \u201cToday\u2019s opinion does only what it says it does: \u2018affords an opportunity\u2019 for the parties and Courts of Appeals to reconsider the parties\u2019 arguments\u201d in light of the information gleaned from the order. Sotomayor emphasized that the order \u201cdoes not\u201d endorse the views of the non profit groups that \u201cthe existing regulations substantially burden their religious exercise.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders is looking to have a strong final month in the Democratic presidential race Win or lose, he has pushed the Democratic party leftward and excited young voters The math is against Bernie Sanders in his fight for the White House. But the Vermont senator is poised to leave behind a durable legacy: A generation of liberal voters enthralled by his populist message \u2013 and a Democratic Party whose ideological center has shifted left during the 2016 election. The effort now is to make sure things stay that way. Sanders has vowed to take his campaign to the Democratic convention, but he\u2019s also signaled that his effort is now more of a movement than a competitive political machine. He\u2019s slashed staff and slowed down his breakneck pace of campaigning. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up On the trail, his core issues like income equality and campaign finance reform still loom large, but the senator has taken to reflecting on the arc of his campaign. He frequently reminds his followers that their revolution began as an unlikely campaign that the media and the political class outright dismissed. \u201cWhen we began this campaign, nobody really thought it would go very far because many of the pundits were saying who in America supports the idea of a political revolution?\u201d Sanders said at a campaign rally in Morgantown Thursday night. West Virginia and Nebraska vote Tuesday night. As Hillary Clinton stands on the cusp of clinching her party\u2019s nomination and facing off against Donald Trump, even Democrats supporting her say Sanders has permanently changed the political landscape. He\u2019s introduced new ideas that have become fixtures in Democratic debates \u2013 like his signature proposal for free college \u2013 and raised expectations of the party\u2019s liberal base. Under pressure from Sanders and his supporters to embrace more progressive positions, Clinton has reversed her position on thorny political issues like the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Trade Pacific Partnership, coming out against both projects during the primary. And this week, Clinton also appeared to shift left on health care, saying she would support giving people the option to \u201cbuy into Medicare at a certain age.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m also in favor of what\u2019s called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age,\u201d Clinton said Monday in Virginia. Those comments brought her closer to Sanders\u2019 support for a single-payer health care program, which the senator dubs \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who endorsed Clinton but has also publicly praised Sanders\u2019 role in the Democratic primary, said the senator\u2019s campaign has pulled both the party and Clinton in a more liberal direction. This shift, Rendell predicted, will not be fleeting: \u201cIf he moved the needle from 5 to 9, let\u2019s say, it won\u2019t always be a 9 \u2013 but it won\u2019t go back to 5.\u201d Rendell added that Sanders will have the \u201crare opportunity\u201d to remain a powerful voice during Clinton\u2019s general election fight and beyond 2016. \u201cMost defeated politicians, once their campaign is over, lose their ability to continue to impact,\u201d he said. \u201cHe, I think, has an increasingly positive opportunity to impact \u2013 if he\u2019s willing.\u201d Barack Obama's last campaign With the end of the primary season just one month away, Sanders\u2019 campaign is laying down the groundwork to influence the party platform at the convention in July. On Friday, the senator wrote to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, requesting that he be adequately represented on the various convention committees. Sanders leaves door open to being Clinton\u2019s VP And Sanders told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Friday he plans to still talk about Clinton. I will continue to run an issue-oriented campaign,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWill I be taking on Donald Trump? Absolutely. Will I be discussing the differences of opinion Secretary Clinton and I have? Yes I will.\u201d Clinton will have to convince some Sanders supporters that she is worth voting for in November. In 2008, there were plenty of hurt feelings between her camp and Barack Obama backers after the primary, but the party quickly came together. The specter of Trump winning should help Democrats unify, but the more passionate Sanders supporters that turn up to his rallies say they\u2019d rather write-in Sanders, vote for a third party candidate or sit out altogether. \u201cWhether you support Sen. Sanders or you support me, there\u2019s much more that unites us than divides us,\u201d Clinton said at a rally last week after winning four of five Democratic contests. Trailing Clinton by some 300 pledged delegates, Sanders has brought his rallying cry to West Virginia, which holds its Democratic primary Tuesday. Sanders: Dem convention tilted toward Clinton Benjamin Male, a 23-year-old Sanders supporter from Clarksburg, is one of the thousands of young voters who have rallied around Sanders\u2019 populist rhetoric. A night auditor at a Marriott who is training to be a manager, Male said he doesn\u2019t believe the Democratic contest is over yet and doesn\u2019t plan to vote for Clinton in the general election \u2013 unless she were to name Sanders as her running mate. \u201cHe is now the face of this movement,\u201d Male said. \u201cSo even if he were to drop out tomorrow, this movement is not over.\u201d Alex Mayers, a 29-year-old from Fairmont who is half Costa Rican, said free college is \u201cthe single most important\u201d issue currently facing the country. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a strong country without an educated work force,\u201d he said. Wearing a black T-shirt with an illustration of Sanders smoking a marijuana joint on top of a tank that is pointed at Clinton, Trump, Jeb Bush and Ben Carson, Mayers said he would not vote for Clinton in November and write in Sanders, instead. For Regina McGraw, a 60-year-old Democrat from Morgantown, her support for Sanders also has much to do with her outright rejection of Clinton. Attending the rally with her son, daughter-in-law and grandchild, McGraw described Clinton as \u201cphony\u201d who has \u201cno idea what it\u2019s like to be middle class.\u201d \u201cI think Bernie probably knows the price of milk and I\u2019ll bet she has no clue,\u201d McGraw said. When Clinton officially wins her party\u2019s nomination, it will have been after a hard-fought battle against Sanders that exposed vulnerabilities of both her candidacy and her platform. Sanders stormed the national stage at a time when Clinton was struggling and progressive activists were relentless but unsuccessful in their attempts to draft Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the presidential race. He launched his campaign in Burlington, Vermont, last May, telling the crowd that he was sick and tired of seeing a country run by \u201ca handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists.\u201d In the months to come, his rallies swelled in size and Sanders soon emerged Clinton\u2019s only serious rival. Day in and day out, Sanders railed against a \u201crigged economy\u201d and corrupt Washington that he said was doing little to help a declining middle class. The political process, he said, had become a game to be manipulated by the country\u2019s elite: millionaire and billionaire donors; powerful lobbyists and special interest groups; and the behemoth financial institutions whose greed, Sanders said, led to the recent economic collapse. The contrast to Clinton was obvious \u2013 she and former President Bill Clinton are prolific fundraisers from big donors and she has collected millions of dollars from speeches to Wall Street. Sanders has shown remarkable popularity with young voters. He\u2019s overwhelmingly outperformed Clinton among voters 18-29 years in age, in some states with more than 80% of support. Former West Virginia Democratic Party Chairman Nick Casey said he has not seen the current level of enthusiasm among young people in decades. \u201cI\u2019m a child of the \u201960s and it reminds me of the days when there was some motivation and interest driven by a very bad reason, the Vietnam War, when people were excited and interested in what the heck was going on,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d Although Sanders was adamant at first that he would not directly go after Clinton, in recent months, that stance has shifted. He questioned the former secretary of state\u2019s paid speeches to banks like Goldman Sachs, calling on her to release transcripts from those events. Sanders also said he questioned Clinton\u2019s judgment, pointing to her past support for the Iraq War and international trade agreements, as well as her refusal to denounce a pro-Clinton super PAC. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and senior vice president at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, said Sanders\u2019 biggest impact on the 2016 race has been to force Clinton to address issues that are top priority for the progressive left. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that he raised a set of issues that Hillary Clinton is not terribly comfortable with and more in the wheelhouse of an Elizabeth Warren or a Bill de Blasio \u2013 around inequality, corruption in politics,\u201d Greenberg said. The criticism that Clinton has fielded from Sanders, Greenberg added, will ultimately work to Clinton\u2019s benefit as she gears up to take on Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump in November. Like Sanders, Trump has touted a populist message, denouncing outside money in politics and promising to fight for the disenfranchised. Clinton \u201chas no choice but to continue with it,\u201d Greenberg said, \u201cif for no other reason than Trump is very effectively running as an outsider for the little guy, anti-politician, anti-big money.\u201d",

In new digital videos from Kasich\u2019s campaign, as well as a similar TV ad from the super PAC supporting him, Cruz\u2019s comments disparaging \u201cNew York values\u201d are highlighted.

            "article_content": "Allies of Mitch McConnell are trying to stop Marlin Stutzman from winning an Indiana Senate primary Stutzman is a member of the anti-leadership House Freedom Caucus Rep. Marlin Stutzman is a member of the anti-leadership House Freedom Caucus, a conservative in the mold of Ted Cruz and a three-term Indiana congressman who voted against John Boehner as speaker. Now, he wants a promotion to the Senate \u2013 and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies want to stop that. Privately, McConnell has made clear to his confidantes that he wants to bolster the candidacy of Stutzman\u2019s chief GOP rival, Rep. Todd Young, and push him over-the-top in the May 3 primary, according to sources familiar with the conversations. Publicly, McConnell\u2019s super PAC has made Indiana the first state of the cycle to begin an aggressive TV ad campaign on Young\u2019s behalf. And one of the GOP leader\u2019s closest allies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is also spending big bucks on the airwaves to promote Young. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up The move marks a new front in the simmering wars between the establishment and the right flank of the party, a battle that has dominated the GOP since the 2010 midterms and is roiling the 2016 presidential contest. But in this case, McConnell and his allies appear to be maneuvering to defeat a candidate whom they view not only as weak in a general election \u2013 but also as a potential troublemaker in the Senate GOP Conference, much like Cruz. In an interview with CNN, Stutzman pointedly accused McConnell of retaliating against him for his vote against Boehner last year, saying it \u201cwould be a lot harder\u201d for him now to back the Kentucky Republican as Senate leader if he wins in November. He had previously signaled he\u2019d back McConnell as leader. Despite Wisconsin win, GOP senators in no rush to back Cruz \u201cThey don\u2019t want me to be the next senator from Indiana,\u201d Stutzman said. \u201cI think (McConnell) is making a mistake by going after conservatives and trying to pick the nominee in Indiana because we just don\u2019t like that.\u201d Stutzman added: \u201cTodd Young is going to vote \u2018yes\u2019 for Mitch McConnell, and Mitch McConnell knows that I voted against John Boehner. \u2026 Todd Young is a yes-man.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always a foregone conclusion that Stutzman would be in the middle of a war with the GOP leadership. Last year, in an effort to professionalize his operation, he hired well-connected GOP operatives in Washington who have deep ties to the leadership. He met privately with McConnell at National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters last summer and had a \u201ccordial\u201d meeting with the GOP leader, according to Stutzman and a McConnell aide. He later even met with a top official at the Chamber of Commerce, and asked the group for its support. But GOP leaders were skeptical. Stutzman later parted ways with his hired D.C. operatives, was spurned by McConnell and the Chamber and instead allied himself with anti-establishment forces like the Club for Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund. And now the Indiana Senate primary has become ground zero for the party\u2019s internal war with major repercussions for the GOP\u2019s ability to hang onto their narrow 54-46 majority in the chamber. Ted Cruz's Washington friends: The House Freedom Caucus \u201cI don\u2019t think (the divide]) has anything to do with conservative principles. \u2026 but it\u2019s more a question of who are you associated with and what are your tactics?\u201d said GOP Sen. Dan Coats, whose retirement is spawning the fight for his seat in the Hoosier State. \u201cI think overall McConnell is looking to disprove the narrative that Republicans aren\u2019t capable of getting things done.\u201d Former Indiana Rep. David McIntosh, head of the Club for Growth, said his group planned to spend money on TV soon to promote Stutzman. \u201cHe is the establishment choice,\u201d McIntosh said of Young. \u201cMarlin is the outsider running in the race.\u201d Young declined to be interviewed. But a spokesman said that Stutzman has taken a variety of positions that directly contradict his small-government rhetoric. \u201cStutzman has proven he\u2019ll toss conservative principle aside if he thinks it benefits him personally,\u201d said Trevor Foughty, Young\u2019s campaign manager. A top McConnell aide, Brian McGuire, confirmed that the GOP leader met with Stutzman last year but declined further comment, referring inquiries about the ads to the groups bankrolling them. Outside war against Stutzman Soon after the 2014 midterms, McConnell moved swiftly to solidify his hold on the Senate majority. He enlisted his top confidantes to put together a super PAC focusing exclusively on Senate races. That super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, made its first ad reservations of the cycle this week: a $230,000 TV and digital ad buy in Indiana. The ad dubs the 43-year-old Young as a \u201crock-solid conservative.\u201d Ted Cruz picks up another Freedom Caucus endorsement The ad comes after the group\u2019s affiliated non-profit, One Nation, has spent $374,800 in the state, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, a firm that tracks media buys, with ads promoting Young\u2019s views on national security. Asked why his group had decided to make Indiana the state of its first ads of the cycle, Senate Leadership Fund spokesman Ian Prior argued that Young is best equipped to be senator. \u201cWe think Todd Young is a strong conservative whose story needs to be told to Republican voters,\u201d Prior said. The Chamber of Commerce has dropped $452,390 in the state, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, as it moves aggressively to prop up Young. Rob Engstrom, the political director at the Chamber, said that the group did not take into consideration Stutzman\u2019s opposition to Boehner as it put its muscle behind Young. Instead, Engstrom argued that Young\u2019s views align with the business community\u2019s. And he was sharply critical of Stutzman for \u201clooking me in the eye\u201d and privately seeking his group\u2019s endorsement at a meeting last June \u2013 only to bash the group publicly after it backed Young instead. In the interview, Stutzman pushed back, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything hypocritical at all by asking the Chamber of Commerce for their endorsement\u201d given that he sought support from people of all stripes. Still, he added: \u201cTheir agenda isn\u2019t in the best interest of our country all the time.\u201d Stutzman, 39, has moved quickly up the ranks \u2013 starting in 2002 when, at age 26, he was elected as the youngest member of the Indiana statehouse. In 2010, he ran for the U.S. Senate seat and won the endorsement of the anti-establishment Senate Conservatives Fund. But he lost in the primary to Coats by 10 points. In the House, Stutzman not only was among 25 Republicans to vote against Boehner, but he has taken positions that have at times angered his party\u2019s leadership. He voted against a procedural rule in 2015 to take up trade legislation, nearly scuttling the bill. The move infuriated GOP leaders since he ultimately backed the trade bill, a major priority of the GOP leadership. Stutzman, however, has shown a desire to work with GOP leaders at times. And for that reason, McIntosh of the Club for Growth sees the congressman more in the mold of Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse rather than a bomb-thrower like Cruz, who has capitalized on his high-profile battles with McConnell and GOP senators during his presidential run. \u201cMarlin is more in the style of a Ben Sasse that stands up for what he believes in but also works with his colleagues,\u201d McIntosh said. Coats, who is staying neutral in the race, declined to say if he thought Stutzman would act like Cruz if he became a senator. \u201cI\u2019m going to pass on that,\u201d Coats said. \u201cThey both have rock solid conservative records.\u201d Asked if he would act like Cruz, Stutzman said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a record in the House that stood for pro-growth, pro-defense and anti-establishment.\u201d Just four years ago, the veteran GOP Sen. Richard Lugar was defeated in stunning fashion by a tea party insurgent, Richard Mourdock, in a hotly contested primary contest. Yet Mourdock lost the general election to now-Sen. Joe Donnelly after the GOP candidate said that pregnancies caused by rape are part of God\u2019s intentions. Some Republicans warn that Stutzman could be another version of Mourdock, especially since Democrats have fielded a top-tier candidate, former Rep. Baron Hill. Stutzman and his allies sharply push back at that assertion, saying the three-term congressman is battle-tested and would win in the red state. To other Republicans, this fight is less about electability and more about personality. In a sign that that may be the case, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is in charge of Senate strategy for the GOP, is staying out of the primary. Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the NRSC, said that either Young or Stutzman would win the general election. \u201cWe\u2019re not involved in the primary,\u201d Wicker said. \u201cI think our nominee will win that race.\u201d There hasn\u2019t been much public polling in the Indiana Senate race, so it\u2019s hardly clear how next month\u2019s primary will shake out. And it will be overshadowed and likely influenced by the GOP presidential primary, which is also the same day. Democrats say thanks to the likelihood that it\u2019ll either be Donald Trump or Ted Cruz as the GOP nominee, their party could pull off an upset in the conservative state\u2019s Senate race. \u201cThey\u2019re all kind of vulnerable \u2013 especially with either Cruz or Trump at the top of the ticket,\u201d said Montana Sen. Jon Tester, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, when asked about Stutzman versus Young. CNN\u2019s Gregory Wallace contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders had a sweeping victory in Dearborn, Michigan, a city with a large Arab population Muslim voters explain that Sanders' Jewish identity is not an issue Bernie Sanders\u2019 win over Hillary Clinton in Tuesday\u2019s Michigan primary was a surprise, not only because he performed so much better than polls had predicted, but because he also appears to have appealed to the state\u2019s Muslim voters. The city of Dearborn, with a population of about 40% Arab American residents, released election results showing that among all voters there, Sanders received 59% of the votes and Hillary Clinton received 39%. There is no way to know exactly how much support Sanders had among Muslim voters specifically, but Sanders\u2019 strong showing in an area with a high concentration of Arab American voters bucked an assumption some media commentators had about Muslim voters and Jewish candidates. Some Muslims in Michigan are voting for a Jewish candidate. Maybe the stat of the night: NBC reports Dearborn Michigan, 40% Arab, goes to Jewish candidate in Democratic primary. BL \u201cI think this is testimony against stereotypes that Muslims are anti-Semitic,\u201d Dalia Mogahed, director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cMuslim Americans are voting for policies.\u201d While Muslims make up just 1% of the U.S. population, some 70% of them lean towards or identify with the Democratic Party, according to a 2015 Pew Research Center report. Sanders has come out strongly against Islamophobia. \u201cHis voice is consistent and credible for many younger Muslim voters,\u201d Mogahed said. Several presidential hopefuls have made comments about Muslim Americans while on the campaign trail. In fact, during Thursday\u2019s Republican debate, CNN moderator Jake Tapper asked Donald Trump to clarify remarks he made during an interview with Anderson Cooper, in which Trump stated: \u201cI think Islam hates us.\u201d Tapper asked whether Trump was referring to all Muslims, and the Republican hopeful responded, \u201cI mean a lot of them.\u201d There\u2019s more to Sanders\u2019 appeal than just his stance on Islamophobia, Mogahed said. \u201cThe American Muslim voter is looking for someone who will create jobs and help the economy grow. They are looking for someone who is going to bring the country together on civil rights issues,\u201d she said. Sanders: Michigan is proof of a political revolution Farah Erzouki, a 23-year-old graduate student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, voted for Sanders on Tuesday because she aligns with almost every domestic policy he has laid out. \u201cI appreciate the genuineness of Sanders\u2019 campaign,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI am a believer of single-payer health care, free tuition in public universities and expansion of other social service programs. I am pro-choice, pro-LGBTQ rights and am generally progressive politically.\u201d Sanders being Jewish is simply not an issue for her and the other Muslim American voters she knows, Erzouki said. \u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing that the only time the Arab and Muslim vote has gotten this much media attention in the general election is due to the perception that Arabs and Muslims would not vote for a Jewish candidate,\u201d she said. Sanders shocks America, stuns Clinton in Michigan Dearborn resident Mohamad Naim also voted for Sanders during the primaries because he supports Sanders political ideology. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of the people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a president who has not been bought out by corporations and doesn\u2019t want to go to war.\u201d As a first-generation American, Naim has been speaking to his parents, who are immigrants from Lebanon, about why he\u2019s voting for Sanders. \u201cI told them Sanders voted against the war in Iraq, that he was against bailing out Wall Street, and my parents know he\u2019s Jewish,\u201d the 25-year-old Detroit teacher said. \u201cI have never viewed Judaism as something incompatible with my own views.\u201d After numerous political discussions around the dinner table, the 32-year age difference between Naim and his father melted away during Michigan\u2019s primary. Naim\u2019s father voted for Bernie Sanders, too.",

            "article_content": "Five presidential candidates spoke to CNN's Jake Tapper for Sunday's \"State of the Union\" New Hampshire voters go to the polls on Tuesday Donald Trump defended his answer from Saturday's night's debate saying he would bring back waterboarding With just days to go before New Hampshire voters head to the polls for the first-in-the-nation primary, top presidential candidates from both parties sat down with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper for Sunday\u2019s CNN \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Billionaire businessman Donald Trump, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie each made their case for why they deserved voters\u2019 support, as well as taking a few shots at their competitors. What you need to know about America\u2019s voting system Here are the highlights: Sanders declined to join calls for Clinton to release transcripts from her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other big banks, despite mounting pressure from progressives \u2013 including his own spokeswoman \u2013 for the Democratic front-runner to do so. Sen. Bernie Sanders on State of the Union: Part 2 In a wide-ranging interview, the Vermont senator also ripped a key Clinton surrogate, predicted a close race in New Hampshire\u2019s upcoming primary and even exuded confidence that he will do well in South Carolina. \u201cDo you think she should (release the transcripts), and what do you think would be revealed in those transcripts?\u201d Tapper asked Sanders. \u201cNo idea,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI have no idea what she said and I think the decision as to whether or not to release it is her decision.\u201d Sanders, however, did not hold back when Tapper asked him about David Brock, the man who runs the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA. Clinton, Sanders, and Rubio are money race winners \u201cI happen to like Hillary Clinton, but I am astounded by some of the people that she has hired, including David Brock,\u201d Sanders said, questioning his opponent\u2019s judgment. The Republican front-runner said Sunday he would \u201cgo through a process\u201d to end waterboarding\u2019s status as a war crime in order to use it against ISIS if he is elected president. Donald Trump on State of the Union: Full Interview \u201cI\u2019d go through a process and get it declassified frankly \u2026 certainly waterboarding at a minimum,\u201d Trump told Tapper. \u201cThey\u2019re chopping off heads of Christians and many other people in the Middle East. They\u2019re chopping heads off, they laugh at us when they hear we\u2019re not going to approve waterboarding and then they\u2019ll have a James Foley and others where they cut off their heads.\u201d Trump said during Saturday night\u2019s ABC Republican debate in New Hampshire that he would reinstate waterboarding if elected and \u201cbring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\u201d But he did not say what he would do that was \u201cworse.\u201d \u201cYou can say what you want I have no doubt that it does work in term of information and other things,\u201d Trump told Tapper. Clinton said Sunday the only way for women to deal with the \u201cdouble standard\u201d in the way female candidates are treated by pundits is to \u201ckeep forging through it.\u201d Hillary Clinton on State of the Union: Full Interview \u201cWe are still living with a double standard,\u201d Clinton told CNN. \u201cI know it. Every woman I know knows it, whether you\u2019re in the media as a woman, or you\u2019re in the professions or business or politics, and I don\u2019t know anything other to do than just keep forging through it, and just keep taking the slings and arrows that comes with being a woman in the arena.\u201d Clinton said she finds the discussion about her volume on the campaign trail interesting, adding, \u201cSometimes I talk soft, sometimes I get passionate and I get a little bit excited. I don\u2019t know any man who doesn\u2019t do the same thing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so used to this,\u201d Clinton told Tapper, telling voters to judge her by her record. Clinton also called attention to issue of tainted drinking water in Flint, Michigan, a place where she and Sanders will debate at an event hosted by CNN. Clinton is also traveling to Flint on Sunday. \u201cI know something about lead poisoning because of the work I\u2019ve done in the past (with Children\u2019s Defense Fund) and as a senator from New York, we had a lot of old housing with lead paint in it. A lot of kids suffered from lead poisoning,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd part of the challenge is you\u2019ve got to intervene early. We need comprehensive health screenings, then we need to figure out how do we get the right nutrition and vitamins. You\u2019ve got to begin to work to counteract the lead.\u201d Fresh of Saturday night\u2019s debate performance, Christie highlighted his high-profile shutdown of Marco Rubio, saying it effectively ended the \u201cchattering class\u201d anointment of the Florida senator. Gov. Chris Christie on State of the Union: Full Interview \u201cI think the whole race changed last night. Because you know there was a march among the chattering class to anoint Sen. Rubio,\u201d the New Jersey governor told CNN. \u201cI think after last night, that\u2019s over. So I think there could be four or five tickets out of New Hampshire because the race is so unsettled now.\u201d Christie scored big with pundits and debate-watchers Saturday when he repeatedly interrupted Rubio, as the Florida senator tried to score a hit on him. As Rubio criticized Christie\u2019s fiscal management skills, the New Jersey governor cut in, \u201cThat\u2019s what Washington D.C. does: the drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information. And then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.\u201d Kasich argued Sunday that he\u2019s not running in the \u201cestablishment lane\u201d in New Hampshire, while downplaying a joke he made that he would be better off running in the Democratic primary. Gov. John Kasich on State of the Union: Full Interview \u201cI\u2019m not an establishment guy, I\u2019m sort of in a lane of my own,\u201d Kasich told CNN. Kasich is running close with Christie, Rubio and Jeb Bush in New Hampshire for support among moderate and more traditional Republican voters. And all four men are running well behind Donald Trump, who appears poised for his first win of the race. Kasich played up his conservative bona fides Sunday, after joking that he might have been better off running as a Democrat. \u201cWhen you balance as many budgets as I have, have cut as much taxes, been for as much school choice, reformed welfare, ended the entitlements \u2013 go through all this, grow government at a very small amount. I don\u2019t understand it other than maybe sometimes I say we need to work together with the Democrats,\u201d Kasich said of Republicans who have questioned his standing on the right. With just two days left until New Hampshire voters make their picks, the candidates sought to downplay expectations. Trump, who has been a clear leader in the polls in New Hampshire since last summer, sounded more tepid Sunday, almost a week after his second-place finish in Iowa. \u201cI want to win New Hampshire. But I don\u2019t think I have to win it. No,\u201d Trump told Tapper. The latest CNN/WMUR tracking poll, released Sunday, showed Trump\u2019s lead on the Republican side growing to a full third of likely voters Tuesday. Trump garnered 33% support, followed by Rubio at 16%, Ted Cruz at 14%, Kasich at 11% and Bush at 7%. But while Trump appears to be pulling away in New Hampshire, the Democratic race appears to be tightening. Sanders led Clinton, 58%-35% in the poll \u2013 a sizable lead, but not as big as a week ago, when he led her by a 2-1 margin. Sanders, who just narrowly lost Iowa to Clinton on Monday night, joked that he didn\u2019t want Tapper to \u201cjinx\u201d him with questions of how he would do in New Hampshire. \u201cDon\u2019t make me nervous and don\u2019t jinx me,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be a close election. We\u2019re working really hard.\u201d Sanders tried to overplay Clinton\u2019s expectations, noting that New Hampshire is where she held of then-Sen. Barack Obama with a win in 2008. But Clinton has pressed the case that Sanders has a homefield advantage, because he comes from neighboring Vermont. She also played down her expectations Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just going to work as hard as I can,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI love the New Hampshire primary. I love it because the interactions you have with voters in every setting is so rewarding, and voters in this state take a first, second, third, fourth look at you. They\u2019re constantly evaluating.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jedd Rosche contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "\"A vote for anyone else is a vote for Trump,\" Cruz said Tuesday night Cruz backers are concerned that a Trump win in Iowa could create unstoppable momentum The stakes for Ted Cruz heading into the Iowa caucus are getting higher. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to skip Thursday\u2019s Fox News Channel Republican debate puts Cruz in the spotlight \u2013 for better or worse. Should Cruz do well and end up winning Iowa, he\u2019ll have momentum heading into contests past New Hampshire. But should he lose, he may never be able to break through as GOP voters look elsewhere for an anti-Trump candidate. A growing number of Cruz\u2019s campaign donors, allies and associates are considering what the road ahead would look like should the Texas senator lose to Trump in Monday\u2019s caucuses, particularly if that means Trump would be, in Cruz\u2019s words, \u201cunstoppable.\u201d \u201cA vote for anyone else is a vote for Trump,\u201d Cruz told an older well-wisher here privately after an event under a Valentine\u2019s Day-themed quilt. \u201cTo be honest, even if you want another candidate to win the nomination, if Trump wins Iowa, that just sucks the oxygen out for everyone,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, just think about it.\u201d Why I\u2019m voting for Trump Trump leads Cruz 30% to 23% in a Monmouth University poll released Wednesday. With less than a week until the caucuses and even with Trump upending all plans by stunningly deciding not to participate in the debate, Cruz World is not outwardly scrambling. Backers remain confident that the race is at worst a toss-up, and believe that their organization on the ground means they have the advantage in a coin flip. Skipping debate, Donald Trump gambles with Iowa The closing argument: If you want to stop Trump, Cruz is your best \u2013 and perhaps only \u2013 option. And there\u2019s no time to waste. \u201cThe people who are loyal supporters of Carson, Huckabee and Santorum should send them a thank you card for their commitment to our country, and then just vote for Cruz,\u201d said Iowa Rep. Steve King, one of Cruz\u2019s top supporters here. \u201cThis has now become a binary decision,\u201d King said. \u201cEither you\u2019re from Trump, or your vote needs to be Cruz.\u201d Cruz forces are making that choice clear by blanketing the airwaves: On Tuesday, the main super PAC supporting Cruz unveiled its fourth negative ad on Trump in the previous 24 hours \u2013 the seventh total pro-Cruz, anti-Trump spot released since Friday. And across Iowa on Tuesday, Cruz\u2019s official campaign trotted out Rick Perry, the former Texas governor widely known for his retail skills and ability to connect with everyday Iowans. The Iowa ground here is the most fertile territory for any candidate to beat Trump in any early voting state, and Cruz on the stump appeared to share a newfound sense of urgency in closing the deal. He was counting down the hours to caucus day at every stop (\u201c143 hours\u201d he said at a community center here.) He was blasting Trump as a \u201cgremlin\u201d for impugning the reputation of one of his top Iowa surrogates, Bob Vander Plaats. And those surrogates and he were repeatedly telling crowds that this is a \u201ctwo-man race\u201d for the GOP nomination, effectively telling Iowans that their only options on Monday are either Donald Trump, or to stop Donald Trump. \u201cThis is the place and time where it is easiest to do that,\u201d said Bryan English, Cruz\u2019s Iowa state director, saying the caucus process would vet Trump in ways that later states wouldn\u2019t. \u201cIf you look at the electoral map, it doesn\u2019t get any easier after Iowa.\u201d Making next Monday a referendum on Trump is far cry from when Cruz last touched down in Iowa at the beginning of the month, when Cruz\u2019s campaign was projecting an outright win and he was leading Trump by double digits in some polls. Now, Cruz uses phrases like \u201cneck-and-neck,\u201d \u201cdead heat,\u201d and \u201cessentially tied,\u201d to describe the state of the race, abandoning some of the swagger that his campaign had just a bit ago. And revealingly, Cruz\u2019s friends have begun offering critiques of the polling industry that they used to herald \u2013 surveys this late are inaccurate, one said; you can\u2019t measure a caucus, another added \u2013 speaking to how the numbers no longer favor them like they once did. Cruz led Trump by a few points in Iowa polls at the beginning of the month, before Trump began a ceaseless attack on Cruz\u2019s eligibility to be president due to his being born in Canada. Cruz\u2019s polling averages in Iowa have fallen and Trump now leads most surveys. It was an alarm sounded by Cruz himself at a private meeting on Monday evening here in Iowa, when Cruz pontificated on the idea of a Trump win and what the consequences would be for the GOP. \u201cIf Donald wins Iowa, he right now has a substantial lead in New Hampshire, if he went on to win New Hampshire as well, there is a very good chance he could be unstoppable and be our nominee,\u201d Cruz said in a video of the event recorded by the Christian Broadcasting Network. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Cruz tried to walk back the declaration, pointing to his strength in Southern states that vote March 1 and stressing that he is running a \u201cnational campaign.\u201d People close to the campaign stress that its fundraising gives it several shots to take down Trump, especially in delegate-rich states that vote later in the calendar. \u201cHe can wipe away a loss in New Hampshire, in Iowa and South Carolina with a single win in Texas,\u201d said one campaign fundraiser. Of particular value to the Cruz campaign, in the eyes of this fundraiser \u2013 the quick departure from the race of Ben Carson, who could retain some of his conservative support well past Iowa: \u201cThey\u2019re going to make this race a little bit closer than some would like.\u201d It\u2019s not just Cruz supporters sounding the alarm about what a Trump win here would mean. Matthew Dowd, the chief strategist for George W. Bush\u2019s re-election campaign, said Trump would be \u201cvery hard to stop\u201d as the \u201cdominoes begin to fall.\u201d \u201cHe begins to run the table,\u201d Dowd says of the GOP calendar if Trump wins on Monday. \u201cOnly way I see a real path for the establishment to stop Trump is if he loses Iowa. And I see no path for Cruz unless Cruz wins Iowa.\u201d How Rubio plans to take on Trump People close to the Cruz campaign stress that they will win on Monday if turnout is not abnormally high \u2013 with some pegging it around 130,000 votes on caucus night. But though they have not seen signs of a top-tier turnout operation, sources concede that if turnout is significantly higher \u2013 say, above 150,000 votes \u2013 there is little the Cruz campaign can do to stem the Trump tide. And people are already looking to what happens if Cruz finishes in a close second, arguing that it won\u2019t mean he failed there given how long Trump was dominant in the Hawkeye State. \u201cThe expectation was that he wins Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina \u2013 and the question was: Can anybody beat him?\u2019 said one person close to the campaign, who said Cruz could still emerge as a victor even with a loss. But the person conceded: \u201cA lot of it will depend on the margins.\u201d CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this report",

Follow him @aarondmiller2. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting in New York Aaron Miller: Obama and Netanyahu remain very much at odds on personal and policy levels President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met on the margins of the UN General Assembly on Wednesday for what might be their last meeting of the Obama presidency. It was one of their least contentious meetings, outwardly at least, with both going to great lengths to be nice to one another and to laud the US-Israel relationship. \u201cOur hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,\u201d President Obama said before the meeting in New York. Still, despite the encouraging tone, reports from senior US and Israeli officials suggested (not surprisingly) that in private the two leaders argued over the settlements issue. According to Reuters, after the meeting a senior US official told reporters of \u201cprofound US concerns about the corrosive effect that that is having on the prospect for two states.\u201d So, where do US-Israel ties really stand? And what can we expect moving forward? There were four key takeaways from Wednesday\u2019s meeting: No one should doubt that Obama and Netanyahu remain very much at odds on both the personal and policy levels. Indeed, their relationship remains perhaps the most dysfunctional and least productive of any US president and Israeli prime minister. And while this might have been their last face-to-face meeting, this likely won\u2019t be their last fight. There is a very real possibility that once the election is over, President Obama might consider some sort of virtual peace process initiative \u2013 either a presidential speech laying out US positions on a two-state solution, or pushing for a UN Security Council resolution that seeks to do the same. Should he move in that direction, we are likely to see some combative pushback from Mr. Netanyahu \u2013 and a return to the tough language and bitter public fight that defined much of their relationship during the last eight years. Over the past eight years, tensions between Obama and Netanyahu have focused on two key issues: how to deal with Iran\u2019s putative quest for a nuclear weapon; and the Israeli-Palestinian issue. On Iran, the bitter fight over the nuclear agreement is now behind them. True, Netanyahu is still very much opposed to the deal, but the reality is that there\u2019s not much he can do about it. As for the peace process, the President made a tough presentation on settlements and the Prime Minister pushed back. Yet there was none of the outwardly tense body language, icy stairs, public lectures or mean-spirited backgrounders to the press that have marked their previous encounters on this issue. For now, the peace process is very much in the deep freeze; and there\u2019s little either of them can or even want to do about that. Politics on both the US and Israeli sides helped ease any inclination to fight, let alone to produce a bad meeting. Netanyahu has been vigorously defending the recently concluded US-Israeli Memorandum of Understanding even as his critics have blasted the MOU on the grounds that Israel could have achieved far more had he not opposed the Iran deal and not interfered in US politics by speaking to the US Congress. So Netanyahu really had no choice but to praise the accord and to laud the President for his support of Israel\u2019s security needs. To do otherwise would have undercut that campaign and suggested that US-Israeli relations, on the security side, were far less functional than the Prime Minister had claimed. It would have drawn attention to the fact that for all his determined opposition to the Iran deal and tough bargaining on the MOU, Netanyahu has, in his critics\u2019 eyes, gotten very little in return. Obama also had little reason to want a public confrontation with Israel. Right now, one of the President\u2019s key objectives is to do everything he can to facilitate the election of a Democratic successor. The last thing he wants is a nasty spat with Netanyahu that would give the Republicans an opportunity to accuse him of being anti-Israel and, by implication, link Hillary Clinton to such a policy. A fight with Israel could prove very embarrassing to Mrs. Clinton, and might force her to distance herself from the President or appear less pro-Israel than her opponent. Either course, two months before what could be a close election, might prove costly. The Obama-Netanyahu relationship has been a drama-filled soap opera almost from the get-go, even while the US-Israeli relationship, particularly on the security side, has fared relatively well. It\u2019s now been 70 years since the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, America\u2019s last undeniably great president. And if this year\u2019s presidential campaign demonstrates anything, it\u2019s that the American public\u2019s expectations and aspirations for another genuinely popular, let alone great, president has for now gone the way of the dodo.",

Michael D\u2019Antonio is the author of the new book \u201cNever Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success.\u201d The views expressed are those of the writers. Clinton's deliberations over who might be her vice president don't seem to excite very many people, authors say But Mark Cuban's business bona fides and media experience would weaken many of Trump's advantages, they say As many prominent Republicans dodge and weave around the question, Donald Trump\u2019s quest for a running mate has become, like so much of his campaign, a transfixing spectacle. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina likens the assignment to \u201cbuying a ticket on the Titanic.\u201d Sens. Joni Ernst and Bob Corker said \u201cNo\u201d before being asked. Rarely have so many run from the prospect of being offered such a prominent position. In the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton\u2019s deliberations over who might be her vice president don\u2019t seem to excite very many people. The fiery Elizabeth Warren appears to be out of the running. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, if elected vice president, would be replaced in the Senate by a Republican, and Democrats don\u2019t want that. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine is being promoted as the safest choice, but he is so boring on the stump that it\u2019s hard to imagine him inspiring anyone anywhere to even show up at the polls. We would argue that \u201csafe\u201d is not Clinton\u2019s only option and, in fact, the choice of a calm and moderate running mate could be a terrible waste of an opportunity to expand her base of support. We\u2019ve crunched the numbers \u2013 from a June survey of 1,000 people \u2013 and found a radical option that just might give Hillary a real boost: Mark Cuban. Based in the Southern city of Dallas, Cuban would bring some geographical balance to Clinton\u2019s ticket. But this is probably the least important quality he would add. A true business superstar whose wealth, unlike Trump\u2019s, is readily verified, Cuban is a renowned job creator, a tech pioneer, and a public persona with deep name recognition and real credibility. He has even competed with Trump in the realm of reality TV, as a co-host of the program \u201cShark Tank.\u201d Cuban\u2019s business bona fides and media experience would weaken many of Trump\u2019s advantages. He is also much more of a political outsider than the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee, who actually ran for president in 2000, hoping to gain the Reform Party\u2019s nomination. (He withdrew just prior to the convention.) Although he is extremely pro-business, Cuban is not a political ideologue. In fact his sharpest criticisms in this election season have targeted Trump directly. He has challenged Trump\u2019s claim that he is worth $10 billion or more, and he has suggested the famed deal-maker is not really much of a negotiator. An avid student of politics and public policy, Cuban has criticized Trump\u2019s many outbursts and questioned his grasp of the issues, suggesting that if he\u2019s elected, he would be captive to advisers. \u201cBecause of that, he\u2019s going to be a puppet president,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWhoever is closest to him is going to have a whole lot more impact on this country than probably Donald will.\u201d Although he has not formally endorsed Clinton, Cuban has defended her against critics and praised her \u201cthought-out proposals\u201d because they permit voters to \u201csee where she stands.\u201d He has been open about the idea of running as her vice presidential candidate. In our independent surveys of consumer attitudes going back more than a decade, and involving tens of thousands of Americans, we can see how Cuban would help Clinton. Although Trump scores high in what could be called a \u201cglamor index\u201d of traits, Cuban bests him on a host of measures that could be gathered into a category called \u201clikeability\u201d \u2013 66% were more likely to describe Cuban as \u201cfriendly,\u201d 58% more likely to say Cuban is \u201ccharming,\u201d and 58% more likely to describe Cuban as \u201cfun.\u201d The reality is that although liberal Democrats feel shivers of excitement contemplating a ticket that would include someone like Warren, Clinton would benefit more with a partner like Cuban. Yes, he\u2019s an unconventional pick, but he is hugely popular with the American public. Just look at the numbers: Survey respondents were 46% more likely to describe Cuban as \u201ccharming,\u201d compared with Clinton, while respondents were more than a third more likely to describe Cuban as \u201cenergetic\u201d and \u201ctrendy\u201d than Clinton. But Clinton\u2019s positives vis-a-vis Cuban also point to a team of equals, with the former secretary of state besting the businessman on several traits, with respondents 58% more likely to see her as \u201chelpful,\u201d 40% more likely to see her as \u201csocially responsible,\u201d and 30% more likely to see her as \u201creliable.\u201d All this suggests that across the board, Americans would value a Clinton/Cuban ticket extremely highly as they supplement each other\u2019s strengths, shore up weaknesses, and impress voters with their well-rounded qualities. Would Clinton have the nerve to choose him as a running mate? Well, if she wants to win over those who consider her part of a hackneyed old political establishment, then it\u2019s something she should try.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Sally Kohn: Hard to imagine Democrats, however bitter they may feel about primary, won't unite against Trump Bernie Sanders' potential benefits as a VP pick may be offset by his downsides, she says But on the question of \u201cthe good husband\u201d and any larger political analogies to the Clintons, I think the message of the show was crystal clear.  Peter Florrick was an awful, unreformed, self-important jerk who often damaged his wife\u2019s future in his efforts to try to recapture his past.  Bill Clinton is not making the same mistakes.  Hillary Clinton is not The Good Wife, but Bill Clinton is now playing the good husband. He is standing by his woman. Before Sanders supporters take my head off, let me explain: I\u2019m a Bernie Sanders supporter and believe wholeheartedly in his economic populist vision for the Democratic Party and for America, but he doesn\u2019t do what a VP candidate needs to do:  help the presidential ticket win votes. Sanders has given small signals that he\u2019d be willing to step into that job (on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last weekend, he wouldn\u2019t rule it out), and there\u2019s little doubt that such a move would help Clinton secure Sanders\u2019 voters. Beyond that, at least one recent poll (from not-always-reliable Rasmussen) shows Democrats preferring Sanders as a VP pick. But this should not be the main factor influencing Clinton\u2019s VP decision. Bear in mind: Back in 2008, when Hillary Clinton was in a primary race with Barack Obama, mid-May exit polls showed fully half of her supporters in Indiana saying they would not vote for Barack Obama if he was the Democratic nominee. And one-third of Clinton supporters said they would actually back John McCain over Obama. North Carolina polling numbers back then told the same story. Bernie or bust? The lessons of 1968 Guess what happened? In the general election, Obama beat McCain in both states. Those voters came around. And that was only in a match-up against relative Republican moderate John McCain. It\u2019s hard to imagine that Democrats, however bitter they may feel about the primary battle, won\u2019t unite against Donald Trump. What\u2019s more, Sanders\u2019 potential benefits as a VP pick may be offset by his downside \u2013 namely that he makes the Clinton ticket look even more elderly. So if not Bernie, who? If Clinton is genuinely worried about exciting Sanders\u2019 base and looking to address this with her VP pick, Elizabeth Warren is a much stronger choice. Warren would bring the same base-rallying energy as Sanders, plus younger energy and something else very useful in a running mate: a demonstrated ability to effectively attack Trump \u2013 particularly on his Twitter turf \u2013 something Clinton has been either unwilling or unable to do so far. With Trump attack on 'Mexican' judge, has he hit a new low? Plus, Warren would directly tap into the overall anti-establishment moment coursing through the electorate. There are some other baldly pragmatic reasons that Clinton must look beyond Sanders for her running mate \u2013 whether to Warren or someone else \u2013 in what could be a painfully close general election. All signs point to a tough battle in Rust Belt states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan, crucial to this election\u2019s outcome. A Democratic nominee needs a VP candidate who, yes, aligns with her (or his) values and vision for the nation \u2013 but also helps pick up these key states and the demographics within them. Sanders campaign: Wait for super delegates to vote Consider Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2013 the first- and second-most competitive battleground states in 2008, respectively. The conventional media narrative is that these states reflect the concerns of their white voting populations, that winning over this demographic is key to winning the general election. And for Donald Trump that would surely be true, as his path to victory runs straight through white male voters, as a group. But in 2012, Barack Obama won Ohio because African-American voters turned out at an even greater percentage than in 2008,  giving him a sizable margin. There\u2019s a reason the limited demographic appeal of Sanders stings his supporters: The reality is that Democrats depend not on white swing voters but on mobilizing and activating voters of color (who have been slow to warm to Sanders) to win a national election. In this sense, HUD Secretary Julian Castro, a Latino, or former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, an African-American, would be a good choice for Clinton\u2019s VP.  Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey certainly would add youthful energy to the ticket, though his record of accomplishment is sparser. Tom Perez, secretary of labor under Obama, is also a strong choice because he would help motivate Latino voter turnout and appeal to the Sanders wing of the party. It is possible, of course, that the centrism Clinton is known for would rear its head in her vice presidential choice. Why the woman voter is a myth Consider this: Faced with a general election against Donald Trump, an opponent that many decent Republicans find repugnant, Clinton and her team may use the VP pick to appeal to moderate swing voters and even some Republicans \u2013 thereby expanding her base beyond those left-of-center white, Latino and black voters she can already count on. In this scenario, might she try to woo Tom Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania and the director of Homeland Security under George W. Bush? He\u2019s a pro-choice Republican and \u2013 by his party\u2019s standards today \u2013 a moderate. Or Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who could help with the Rust Belt while helping with the Sanders vote, since Brown is considered more progressive than Clinton. Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight Or \u2013 a very safe choice \u2013 Tim Kaine, a Democratic U.S. senator and former governor of Virginia with impeccable centrist Democratic establishment credentials, well-tested and well-liked, and a solid pick for a heartbeat-away job. Trump University case reveals uncomfortable truths Ultimately, if (and remember, it\u2019s still if) Hillary Clinton is the Democratic Party nominee, Sanders and Warren have already demonstrated a clear willingness to support her nomination and help defeat Trump. As the stakes are raised, one can expect their commitment to be raised as well. And certainly Clinton could look to Obama\u2019s model and promise a senior cabinet post to Sanders as a significant olive branch. No question, it\u2019s going to be tricky picking a person capable of threading all these needles \u2013 a person who engages and even excites the Sanders base and reflects the anti-establishment populist zeitgeist of the moment on left and right, draws in swing voters and resentful Republican votes and has the personality to challenge Trump head-on while also clearly possessing the temperament and qualifications of the presidency.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. This election isn't about who the president will be; it's about what America will be, writes Tiziana Dearing People aren't confused because they're stupid; people are confused because the state of the social contract is a mess, she writes Gallup poll noted in February only 27% of Americans felt the country was headed in the right direction, she continues At some level, the 2016 presidential race has stopped being a presidential race and become a fight about who we are as a country. We clearly don\u2019t know the answer. We do know one thing, though. People seem confused. Confusion breeds Donald Trump. A caller to a national radio program recently noted that he had been a Rand Paul supporter until Paul left the race. Now he\u2019s supporting Bernie Sanders. Paul is a libertarian. Sanders is a socialist. Moving from one to the other is like saying, \u201cI was a vegetarian, but the store was out of broccoli, so I bought a steak.\u201d An interviewee on NPR on Super Tuesday was asked who she supports. She\u2019s a self-identified Christian and began her answer by lamenting false claims of Christianity by many Republican candidates. I figured she\u2019d be a lock for Ted Cruz. Almost. She was undecided between Cruz or Trump. Yeah, because they\u2019d definitely score the same on a Bible quiz. People aren\u2019t confused because they\u2019re stupid. People are confused because the state of the social contract is a mess. The symbols and short cuts we traditionally use to tell us who stands for what are a mess, too. To make matters worse, those taking the clearest stances on what the social contract should be are not necessarily the ones who could get the hard work done to fix it. Put it all together and we get a nightmare, three-way grid. There\u2019s Insider versus Outsider. Then, Who Gets It versus Who Can Govern. Then, there\u2019s a jumble of characteristics like Christian, or Fiscal Conservative, or Pro-Choice, that used to align pretty cleanly with tags like \u201cDemocrat,\u201d \u201cRepublican,\u201d \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative,\u201d but now basically work as \u201cindependent variables.\u201d  They could show up anywhere. Speaking to Donald Trump's people If you\u2019re an upper-class liberal from the Northeast, the country is going to hell in a handbasket. If you\u2019re a working-class conservative from the South, the country\u2019s also going to hell, just in a different basket.  As a Gallup poll noted in February, only 27% of Americans felt the country was headed in the right direction, and it\u2019s been a year since that number topped 30. Either way, we can\u2019t afford business as usual and need someone who understands that. That means the Outsider Who Gets It. So, we get a voter who might prefer Rand Paul, but also Bernie Sanders. But some voters consider themselves realists. They want a person who can govern, or maybe just someone who doesn\u2019t want to blow up the very infrastructure of governance they\u2019re asking to run. That\u2019s likely an \u201cInsider,\u201d even if she or he doesn\u2019t Get It, and it\u2019s one way to get an un-enrolled Massachusetts voter who went for John Kasich in the primary but is ready to for vote for Hillary Clinton in the general. America, wake up to the Trump menace What about voters who feel specific values are critically important?  If you\u2019re an evangelical Christian, conservative Christian values are critical.  Historically, politicians who represented such values also represented ideas like protected trade, a strong national defense or American Exceptionalism. Think George W. Bush circa 1999-2000, when he ran as a Christian and also authored the aggressive security doctrine of \u201cpreemptive defense.\u201d You could pick a candidate who took one of those positions and feel fairly certain he held the others you cared about, too. Not so much in 2016. But that\u2019s hard to see, so we get a voter undecided between Cruz and Trump. Throw in a preference for Outsider, though, and that evangelical dumps Cruz. President Trump: A 6-year-old with nuclear weapons? People don\u2019t like confusion. We like certainty.  Nothing fits that bill better than someone who offers absolutes. Combine absolutism with an Outsider Who Gets It \u2013 and who is so slippery he can convincingly sell, \u201cWhatever values you think you care about, those are my values, too\u201d \u2013 and we get a juggernaut. We get Donald Trump. This election isn\u2019t about who the president will be. It\u2019s about who America will be. If the Insider candidates Who Can Govern don\u2019t do a better job of Getting It, owning that they helped mess it up in the first place, and connecting their plans for fixing it to the core, traditional values of their parties, we\u2019re all in trouble.

Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Frida Ghitis: Democracy can seem like an open invitation to demagoguery If Trump becomes president, America's democratic structure will also be put to the test, she says Perhaps one day Putin will regret intervening in Syria. For now, as his forces bomb hospitals in Syria, and his supporters in Moscow call on the United Nations to punish Obama, Putin can only marvel at the success of his Syrian operation. Not only has he saved Assad from what was starting to look like the end of his rule, but he has also weakened the United States, its allies, and its alliances. Of course, the notion that democracy \u2013 letting the people choose the leaders who govern them \u2013 is the best way, the only legitimate way, to ensure the well-being of a country, remains a source of inspiration for millions around the world. But the sad truth is that its march of late has proven erratic, halting. And in too many cases, it has ended up crushed in a pool of blood. Indeed, a decade that began with the promise of an \u201cArab Spring\u201d has ended up spawning tyranny and massacres. The march of freedom seems in some places to have gone into reverse. Here in the United States an election that is at times admittedly entertaining is simply the latest chapter in the global story of frustration, disappointment and even tragedy for those who believe that democracy is the only acceptable form of government. It is now up to American voters to offer proof to the world that democracy is, indeed, the best form of government by resisting the seduction of a demagogue. In his speech warning Republicans about the dangers of Donald Trump\u2019s rise, former Republican Party candidate Mitt Romney quoted a famously intriguing line from John Adams, America\u2019s second president. \u201cRemember, democracy never lasts long,\u201d Adams wrote. \u201cThere never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.\u201d Of course, Adams\u2019 assertion remains highly questionable. But it is hard to ignore such warnings when confronted with the litany of outrageous remarks, proposals and spectacles presented this campaign season. Or take the words of Winston Churchill, who famously declared, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others that have been tried from time to time.\u201d If ever evidence was needed that Churchill was right, one need only look at this year\u2019s presidential race, which has already seen Trump \u2013 the current GOP front-runner for the post of most powerful world leader \u2013 reassuring voters about the size of his genitals in response to a veiled allusion on the subject from rival Marco Rubio. Trump\u2019s comments were just one of the mind-boggling moments from a single evening in an election season marked by the rise of a candidate who, among other problems, seems to have little regard for the truth (something that apparently does not trouble his backers, a fact that is even more disturbing). Unfortunately, as this campaign has demonstrated, democracy can seem like an open invitation to demagoguery, and to manipulation of the electorate, something that has happened many times in history. In theory, the wisest voices are supposed to be able to persuade the broader electorate and the principle of one man, one vote \u2013 regardless of education, experience or intelligence \u2013 is supposed to work in the end because those with greater abilities can use their talents to show the way. In the end, democracy gives people the right to choose their own leaders, and it is hoped that their choice will, by and large, produce good results. But the debacle in the Republican Party is testing this theory to the limit. The party establishment, including the previous two GOP nominees, appears to be lining up to try to stop Trump, even as Republican primary voters continue to support him. It is a challenge of historic proportions. In addition, former CIA Director Michael Hayden said the military might disobey orders from a president like Trump, who vows to issue directives that violate international law. Meanwhile, Cleveland, which will host the nominating convention, is reportedly ordering thousands of sets of riot gear in expectation of what may prove to be a very ugly event. All this suggests that if Trump were to become president, America\u2019s democratic structure would be put to the test, including the checks and balances necessary to prevent a politician like Trump from dismantling some of this country\u2019s basic democratic principles, as he appears to be considering. Autocrats around the world watching America will no doubt find some comfort in the turmoil. And they will probably exploit the examples of the recent experiences in the United States, the Middle East and elsewhere as a sign that their system is better. But that\u2019s not the moral of this story. Quite the opposite. Consider the second part of Churchill\u2019s maxim. What\u2019s the alternative? What\u2019s a better system? In the short term, there may be an occasional autocrat who serves his country well, but dictatorships do not end well for the countries they oversee. As the philosopher Karl Popper wrote, \u201cAnybody who has ever lived under another form of government \u2013 that is, under a dictatorship which cannot be removed without bloodshed \u2013 will know that democracy, imperfect though it is, is worth fighting for.\u201d That, of course, means real democracy, not the phony, make believe concoctions that tyrants use these days to gain and hold power. The good news is that no system is better suited for correcting the twists and turns of politics than a real democracy. Popper himself advocated a two-party system precisely because he believed it is the one most likely to engender self-examination, reflection and reforms. The one certainty in the current U.S. election is that Republicans will engage in deep introspection when this disastrous intra-party war reaches its conclusion, whatever it may be. This election likely marks a turning point in American politics, and U.S. democracy is unlikely to commit suicide. For the rest of the world, the path forward is more difficult. We already know that freedom has stopped making progress across the globe, while thousands of democracy activists have been dying and going to jail. It has been a tough century so far for democracy. But this is by no means to suggest that the battle is over, because the fact remains that however high the hurdles in the path of democracy, we have yet to find a better way.

            "article_content": "Rep. Tim Ryan said Democrats should have driven a \"deeply economic\" message Ryan is challenging Nancy Pelosi to lead Democrats in the House Rep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat challenging Nancy Pelosi for the party\u2019s House leadership, faulted the House minority leader on Sunday for focusing too narrowly on issues such as Zika virus funding in the lead-up to the election. \u201cWe were talking a lot about issues that weren\u2019t deeply economic, and I think that provided a huge opening for Donald Trump to come in, and that led to the disaster that happened on Tuesday,\u201d Ryan said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d He pointed out that a month before Congress left Washington to hit the campaign trail full time, Democrats were battling for increased funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fight the Zika virus. \u201cThat\u2019s not a deep economic message that\u2019s a national message; that\u2019s a message in a couple (of) regions in the country. And I think things like that throw us off track,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe need a brand as a party that says, we are the party that is going to help working-class people \u2013 white people, black people, brown people, gay people, straight people; improve opportunity for them to grow their wages, to have security, economic security,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got off that message, and when we don\u2019t talk about economics, we lose elections.\u201d A Pelosi spokesman disputed Ryan\u2019s claim that Zika was a more important message priority than the economy, and noted that Ryan, too, had called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to \u201chold an immediate vote on emergency aid\u201d on Twitter in August. Ryan described Democrats as in the middle of a \u201cfamily fight.\u201d In a blow to Pelosi, House Democrats postponed their leadership election that had originally been expected to take place last week. Ryan said he lives in a district where Trump beat Hillary Clinton \u2013 and that the party\u2019s path back to a House majority requires winning some of those seats. \u201cI know who these people are. Some of them are friends of mine, neighbors of mine, who voted for me and voted for Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to get those people back into the fold, and as I told my colleagues, I know in my heart that we cannot win the House back under the current leadership. It\u2019s time for a change.\u201d Ryan said he\u2019s willing to work with Trump \u2013 as long as Trump doesn\u2019t cross Democrats on some of the party\u2019s top priorities. \u201cIf he tries to defund Planned Parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize Medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we\u2019re going to have a Youngstown street fight in the Capitol. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he has other opportunities where we can grow the economy, where we can invest in working-class people \u2013 knowing that one-third of working-class people are people of color, so this is a broad coalition \u2013 then we will look for places to look for him.\u201d Tapper asked Ryan whether infrastructure is one potential area of cooperation. But Ryan said so far, Trump\u2019s infrastructure proposal \u201clooks like a bunch of smoke and mirrors and corporate giveaways.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton could make a giant leap for women in government if she wins the White House On Capitol Hill, it has been smaller steps in recent years The United States could strike a blow for gender equality in November by electing its first woman president, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But the steady progress women have achieved winning seats in the House and Senate has slowed. Today, women make up roughly half of the US population, but hold only 19.4% of the seats in Congress. And those numbers aren\u2019t likely to rise much after after November 8, even with 183 total female congressional candidates on the ballot this fall. In the Senate there are now 20 female lawmakers. According to the Rutgers Center for Women in Politics, 16 women are running for the upper chamber \u2013 12 Democrats and four Republicans. But some of the female candidates are in considerably more competitive races than others. So it\u2019s unlikely there will be more than 23 women senators come January 2017. And if Senate races in Nevada and Pennsylvania with female Democratic candidates don\u2019t go the party\u2019s way, the number could stay static at 20. Across the Capitol there are currently 84 female House members serving, out of 435 seats, good for 19.3% in the chamber. In the fall elections a total of 167 women candidates are running in House races \u2013 120 Democrats and 47 Republicans, according to Rugters. Again, only fraction of these contests are truly competitive, so it\u2019s unclear if there will be a net rise in women House members. Still, while women will continue to hold only about a fifth of congressional seats, give or take, there has been real progress in female service on Capitol Hill in recent decades. That began in earnest in 1992, the \u201cYear of the Women,\u201d when a swath of female lawmakers nabbed congressional races as Bill Clinton \u2013 husband of the current Democratic nominee \u2013 won the White House. That year four women were elected to the Senate and the number of women who would serve in the House rose from 28 to 47. By 2012 the number of women in Congress had hit record highs, with 20 women in the Senate and 80 in the House. However, the number of women in Congress has risen at an exceptionally slow rate. \u201cSo we went from 54 to 57 to 63 to 65 to 73 to 74, so you\u2019re just going up and you\u2019re only netting a couple of women each year,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar at the Rutgers Center for Women in Politics. \u201cWhen we hit 100 women in Congress, there was a big celebration. And what I always sort of remind my students is that the denominator matters, so it\u2019s now a 104 out of 535 [total House and Senate congressional seats]. We\u2019re just not seeing those big jumps. It would take a long time because we\u2019re only netting a couple of women in Congress every year.\u201d Studies cite a range of factors for why it has taken so long to close the congressional gender gap. Long-time tenures by male incumbents and a weak recruitment structure are among the stronger indicators. According to Politifact, roughly 95% of congressional incumbents running in the 2014 were re-elected. When men already hold about 80% of the seats, that creates fewer openings for women successors. That dynamic is on clear display in Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is well behind in her bid to oust Sen. John McCain, first elected in 1986. In Pennsylvania Democrats stand a considerable better chance with their nominee, who is seeking to send Republican Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s career in the upper chamber after a single, six-year term. In Nevada, former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez-Masto is facing off against Rep. Joe Heck, in a race that could go either way. \u201cIf there are less opportunities, its harder to get newcomers in, and women are still to a certain extent newcomers,\u201d Dittmar said. The Best of Sen. Barbara Mikulski Overall in 2016 there\u2019s likely to be relatively little churn in female Senate membership. Fifteen incumbent women senators will remain in their seats for the 115th Congress, as they\u2019re not up for re-election in November. In New Hampshire, one of the most hotly-contested Senate races, incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte is being challenged by another women candidate, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. And in California, where Sen. Barbara Boxer is retiring after 24 years in the seat, she\u2019s all but certain to have a female successor, fellow Democrat Kamala Harris, the state attorney general. Harris\u2019s opponent is  Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez. In Illinois Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat, is favored to defeat Republican incumbent Sen. Mark Kirk. There will be a bit of backsliding, though. In Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen defeated a woman, Rep. Donna Edwards, to become the Democratic nominee \u2013 tantamount to victory in that state \u2013 and replace retiring Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski. A 30-year Senate veteran, after ten in the House, Mikulski was the first woman to chair the Senate Appropriations Committee, before Democrats lost the majority in 2014. Focusing on open House and Senate seats has proven to be a reliable workaround for women running, and organizations pushing for more women in Congress, such as the Democratic EMILY\u2019s List and the Republican Maggie\u2019s List. A day Ruline Steininger waited 103 years for \u201cWe really focus on open seats where there is an opportunity to get a woman in right up front,\u201d EMILY\u2019s List Executive Director Jessica O\u2019Connell said. \u201cThat is the best opportunity to elect more women with more diverse perspectives.\u201d Maggie\u2019s List National Executive Director Missy Shorey also encourages potential candidates to focus on open seats. \u201cI have had to tell very, very qualified candidates, \u2018I\u2019m sorry this isn\u2019t the right district,\u2019\u201d Shorey said. \u201cLike any smart political person, you\u2019re going to seek out where there is the least resistance.\u201d There\u2019s another problem: gridlock. Like most candidates, women office-seekers aim to pass laws \u2013 a challenge in the current Capitol Hill environment where neither the House or Senate are doing much. That can be a real turnoff when recruiting candidates. \u201cIf it looks like politics doesn\u2019t work to get things done, women are going to be less likely to say they want to do it,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cNot because they don\u2019t think they can, or they have no confidence. But because they also might not think it is rationally a good decision or a good use of their time, or a good avenue to get anything done.\u201d Dittmar points to a survey conducted by Center for American Women and Politics that suggests there is actually real gender divide among prospective lawmakers on this point. \u201cWhen we asked what was your number one reason for running for office, women said there was a public policy issue I cared deeply about. For men, the number one reason was \u2018because I always wanted to be in elected office,\u2019\u201d Dittmar said. That\u2019s exemplified by a pair of 2016 female House candidates. Consider Annette Taddeo in Florida\u2019s 26th District. This summer she lost a contentious Democratic primary battle to former Rep. Joe Garcia, in one the districts party strategists have the highest hopes for in defeating a Republican incumbent. Taddeo, who immigrated to the US from Colombia when she was 17, said having a voice in a male-dominated Congress drove her to get involved. \u201cLike my Daddy always told me, if you don\u2019t have a voice on the table, you may be on the menu,\u201d Taddeo said. \u201cThe way they tried to defund Planned Parenthood, a place I personally depended on when I didn\u2019t have the money to go to the doctor, and Planned Parenthood was my doctor. I mean there are just so many reasons why we need our voices at the table.\u201d Then there\u2019s Casey Lucius in California\u2019s 20th District, on the Golden State\u2019s central coast. She\u2019s the underdog in this open district, facing the son of a prominent Democratic official \u2013 prosecutor Jimmy Panetta, whose father, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, held the House seat for 16 years before serving a range in top-level positions in the past two Democratic administrations. \u201cThe reason I initially decided to run was because I\u2019m a professor, and I\u2019d been teaching classes on national security,\u201d said Lucius, who is a former intelligence officer and Navy veteran. \u201cI was feeling frustrated by our lack of national security strategy and lack of foreign policy. So I really was driven by the need to offer policy solutions.\u201d Both women say they have received different treatment than their male counterparts in the political world. \u201cThe feedback that I get from people is about what I\u2019m wearing for my makeup, or my hair, and I\u2019m thrilled when I get a question of substance, about where do I stand on a particular policy issue,\u201d Lucius said. The mother of one says being a parent has caused others to view her House bid negatively. \u201cI have a six-year-old, and people will say, \u2018Well who takes care of your child?\u2019 And I say, \u2018My husband, his father.\u2019 Or people will say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait until he graduates from high school, then you can run for office,\u2019\u201d Lucius recalled. \u201cAnd again, my opponent has two young children, and I wonder if he gets these questions, and I doubt it.\u201d Women record 1920s congressmen's concerns about Equal Rights Amendment Taddeo had run office before, in a previous House race and as the 2014 running mate of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor who sought his old job \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 as a Democrat. Taddeo has raced a double standard, she said. \u201cIn a description in one of the papers it was, \u2018Annette has run three times.\u2019 And in the description it said, \u2018Annette is shopping for a seat.\u2019 never mind that when I ran for lieutenant governor I was actually asked to be the running mate,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you know, my opponent has run, I don\u2019t know, five, six times. But you know the man is a \u2018fighter\u2019 and the woman is \u2018shopping.\u2019 So that really caught my attention because it really is a double standard.\u201d While female politicians are likely to face barriers on the campaign trail and in office, there are organizations that recruit women to become involved in the process, offering help throughout. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that there is an infrastructure of support for women running to say, \u2018Here\u2019s what you need to know, here\u2019s who can be there to back you and have your back, whether that be in taking on some of that unfair treatment or backing them financially or in any other way,\u2019\u201d Dittmar said. O\u2019Connell, the EMILY\u2019s List executive director, emphasized the importance of financially supporting and recruiting women to run for elected office. \u201cWe have a whole campaign program that goes out around the country and meets with women leaders and communities,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cWe make sure we have their back all the way through the process to help them have the resources that they need to have a strong campaign to win.\u201d Financial support has proven to be one of the most important parts of the support system Emily\u2019s List provides. The long road to women's suffrage \u201cWe\u2019ve raised over $400 million on behalf of our women candidates and I think that people understand the needs at the core of the campaigns to make them competitive,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. Maggie\u2019s Last, the Republican group supporting female candidates, shares the goal of recruiting and financially supporting women seeking public office, of course from the GOP side. Established in 2010, Maggie\u2019s List has endorsed over 100 women running for Congress in primaries and general elections. The PAC\u2019s past and current candidates include Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Sen. Joni Ernst, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, Rep. Renee Ellmers, Rep. Mia Love, and the group\u2019s congressional chair, Rep. Mimi Walters. Like EMILY\u2019s List, Maggie\u2019s List has implemented a recruiting system aimed at evaluating and supporting potential candidates and candidates. \u201cWe have to look at this overall and say, \u2018Does this seat make sense?\u2019 Number two, we have to look at what this woman demonstrated the ability to win elections,\u201d said Missy Shorey, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe have 39 state chairs around the country and they can tell you if the woman can win in the district or not.\u201d Shorey and other from Maggie\u2019s List looked at California\u2019s 20th Congressional District, and decided to invest in Lucius as a candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s an open seat. It\u2019s normally a Democratic district, but if you look at it, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of independent voters. They are security voters first and foremost. In Monterey, California, they have a strong military and retiree presence,\u201d Shorey said. \u201cThey\u2019re very concerned about international security and national security. Our candidate happens to have a Ph.D. in national security, has written a strategic plan on how we beat ISIS. Between Republican numbers and independent numbers, that seat is competitive.\u201d Prior to becoming a Republican congressional candidate, Lucius was not widely known outside of her district. However, PACs like Maggie\u2019s List can help give candidates the name recognition needed in a general election. \u201cI find it very encouraging to know that there are organizations out there who are forward thinking, and they\u2019re advocating, and they\u2019re on my side,\u201d Lucius said.",

            "article_content": "In the past, O'Keefe and his Project Veritas Action have been criticized for strategically editing footage The Democratic National Committee quickly distanced itself from the accusations A Democratic operative whose organization was helping Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign announced Tuesday that he would be \u201cstepping back\u201d from the campaign after an edited video suggested that he and other staffers hired people to attend Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rallies and incite violence. Robert Creamer \u2013 husband of Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky \u2013 announced his resignation in a statement after conservative activist James O\u2019Keefe released a video under his organization Project Veritas Action, which showed Creamer and other operatives purportedly discussing methods for inciting violence at rallies for the Republican nominee. In the past, O\u2019Keefe and his Project Veritas Action have been criticized for strategically editing footage to create false accusations about people or groups. Creamer was helping the Democratic National Committee with Clinton\u2019s campaign while working for Democracy Partners, a progressive consulting group. He is also the head of a group called Mobilize, which contracted with the DNC. \u201cI am unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing Hilary Clinton, and defeating Donald Trump in the upcoming election,\u201d Creamer said in a statement. \u201cAs a result I have indicated to the Democratic National Committee that I am stepping back from my responsibilities working with the campaign.\u201d He confirmed that he was referring to the Clinton campaign, with which he was \u201cfully integrated.\u201d Creamer added that \u201ccontrary to the outrageous claims of the notorious right wing blogger James O\u2019Keefe, we have always adhered to the highest standards of transparency and legality in our work for the DNC.\u201d Trump super PAC chair: Trump needs \u2018a miracle\u2019 to win He also denied that any of the schemes in the \u201chypothetical conversations\u201d recorded for the video ever took place. \u201cWe regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a regional contractor for our firm, and he is no longer working with us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile none of the schemes described in the conversations every took place, these conversations do not at all reflect the values of Democracy Partners.\u201d Democracy Partners called O\u2019Keefe\u2019s video a \u201cwell-funded, systematic spy operation that is the modern day equivalent of the Watergate burglars.\u201d Creamer told CNN that the national field director of Americans United for Change, Scott Foval, who was also recorded in the video, made false comments that are wrong about inciting violence at the rallies. Foval has since been fired from Americans United for Change, which had a contracting relationship with Democracy Partners. \u201cI mean, honestly, it\u2019s not hard to get some of these a\u2014\u2014- to pop off,\u201d Foval purportedly says at one point in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of showing up, to want to get into their rally, in a Planned Parenthood T-shirt. Or \u2018Trump is a Nazi,\u2019 you know. You can message to draw them out, and draw them out to punch you.\u201d Creamer said Foval\u2019s comments were \u201cflat out wrong.\u201d \u201cWe have gone to extreme measures to ensure no violence took place at any of our (counter protest) rallies,\u201d Creamer told CNN. Pence: North Carolina GOP office firebombing is \u2018political terrorism\u2019 In 2005, Creamer pleaded guilty to tax violations and $2.3 million in bank fraud in relation to his operation of public interest groups in the 1990s. The DNC quickly distanced itself from the accusations. Donna Brazile, the interim DNC chair, said O\u2019Keefe \u201cis a convicted criminal with a history of doctoring video to advance his ideological agenda\u201d and that the practices have nothing to do with long-term efforts by the group. \u201cThe practices described in the video by this temporary regional sub-contractor do not in any way comport with our long standing policies on organizing events, and those statements and sentiments do not represent the values that the Committee holds dear,\u201d Brazile said in a statement. \u201cWe do not believe, or have any evidence to suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually occurred.\u201d The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, denied that it has helped plant rogue protesters or deliberately incited violence at Trump campaign events. \u201cWhile Project Veritas has been known to offer misleading video out of context, some of the language and tactics referenced in the video are troubling even as a theory or proposal never executed,\u201d Zac Petkanas, a spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign, said in a statement. \u201cWe support the Democratic National Committee\u2019s appropriate action addressing this matter and look forward to continue waging a campaign of ideas worthy of our democratic process.\u201d In 2010, O\u2019Keefe plead guilty to a misdemeanor for breaking into former Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu\u2019s office to tamper with her phone. In 2013, O\u2019Keefe had to pay $100,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a former employee of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, better known as ACORN, after O\u2019Keefe and fellow activist Hannah Giles allegedly solicited advice from ACORN workers on setting up a brothel and evading taxes. The videos led to some employees being fired and contributed to the disbanding of ACORN, which advocated for low- and middle-income families and worked to register voters. But prosecutors in New York and California found no evidence of wrongdoing by the group, and the California probe found the videos had been heavily edited.",

Trump's art of the deal \u201cI think it is all a negotiation ploy,\u201d one Trump campaign official told CNN as the candidate vowed to ignore mounting Republican calls for him to drop out after a leaked tape revealed him making vulgar comments about women. \u201cNever signal you are willing to give up out of the box.\u201d What? An \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d move by Trump? Sounds nuts, right? But amid the madness of Saturday\u2019s news we got a note from another longtime Trump friend reminding us that Trump is on record saying if the polls tanked he might quit the race, and raising the prospect that the candidate might be looking for an exit ramp if Sunday night\u2019s second debate goes poorly. The first source has known Trump only for the course of the campaign; the second for decades. They don\u2019t know each other. Yet in separate exchanges they both volunteered the idea that Trump might be open to negotiating a withdrawal if things go badly in St. Louis. And both added this: that perhaps the price would be a Republican party repayment of the personal funds Trump has poured into his campaign. To be clear, both said they view this as a remote possibility, not a likely turn of events. But that two very different people, with very different relationships with Trump, would suggest that \u201cnever\u201d could be the first play in a negotiation was striking. Listening to Trump brag about forcing himself on women was the last straw for many Republicans, including several in close Senate races. Nervousness in Nevada Among those was Nevada congressman Joe Heck, who on Saturday forcefully called on Trump to step aside. For Heck it was a big switch after months of tolerating other controversial Trump statements. And, as CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston notes, a big risk. \u201cDr. Joe Heck, who\u2019s in a very tight Senate race,  went out on stage yesterday and denounced Donald Trump and got booed over and over again. Now, of all the people who came out against Trump after this tape, I think that for Heck this has maybe one of the biggest gambles. Because Nevada is a state that has been very kind to Donald Trump.\u201d It will take several days to get a good sense of how Trump\u2019s taped comments impact the presidential campaign. And the second debate will also be a factor, regardless of how much Trump\u2019s offensive remarks come up. The biggest test will be where Trump stands in the polls by the end of the week. But Dan Balz of The Washington Post said the flip side is equally, if not more, important. Balz says another key question is whether this episode allows Hillary Clinton to move past the poll ceiling she has had so far throughout the race. \u201cIf it\u2019s a good week for Donald Trump he goes up [in the polls], and if it\u2019s a bad week for Hillary Clinton she goes down, and vice versa,\u201d explains Balz. \u201cPeople, particularly Democrats, are wondering whether this moment \u2013 this tape \u2013 will finally break that cycle. That she will be able to push beyond the margin that she hasn\u2019t been able to top \u2026 the four-to-five-point range, and go even higher. That\u2019s the thing that everyone\u2019s going to be looking over the next couple weeks.\u201d It was just a few weeks ago that some Democrats were ready to write off Ohio as a target state for Clinton. But the first debate changed that. Some polls show her moving to a narrow lead in the Buckeye State. It\u2019s near impossible to draft a Trump path to 270 electoral votes without Ohio. So now that the tape of Trump bragging about groping women is in the campaign mix, Glenn Thrush of Politico suggests Ohio could be a prime test case of its impact. \u201cOhio has been really kinda the bulwark of Trump\u2019s Midwestern strategy, where obviously we have seen some pretty significant defections on the  part of women as a result of this tape. Hillary had surged ahead by one or two points in some recent polling,\u201d says Thrush. \u201cI would just love to see if her improvement in that state is accelerating, because if it is, it\u2019s lights out (for Trump).\u201d The nuts and bolts phase of the campaign is upon us, and Hillary Clinton is getting some help from some progressive friends. CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson shared details of separate pushes by Planned Parenthood and The Human Rights Campaign to identify and turn out Clinton supporters in these final 30 days before the November 8 election. \u201cThe Planned Parenthood $30 million effort \u2013 this is all in swing states, particularly targeting millennial voters. In terms of the HRC, they are very much targeting swing states as well,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cThis goes to show the organizational strength, I think, of the left compared to the right, which is very much in shambles right now in terms of figuring out how to support Donald Trump.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lawmakers are trying to wrap up negotiations on Zika funding A swath of other thorny issues is complicating the talks Lawmakers hoping for a quick resolution in the talks to fund the government and provide a federal response to Zika were disappointed Monday when negotiators, who had worked through the weekend, said they would need more time to agree to a deal. \u201cEverything\u2019s a little up in the (air),\u201d Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the Republican leadership told reporters crowded outside his office waiting for word of an agreement. \u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d With no deal at hand, Senate leaders delayed until at least Tuesday a procedural vote to begin debate on the bill in hopes it might be ready then. In one sign of possible progress late Monday, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who is a member of the Democratic leadership, told reporters that negotiators had resolved a key sticking point over language in the Zika measure that would prevent funds from going to a Planned Parenthood partner in Puerto Rico, something Democrats strongly oppose. \u201cYes, it\u2019s resolved,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cThe whole Zika issue has been resolved.\u201d But a top Senate GOP leadership aide declined to confirm Schumer\u2019s pronouncement. And about an hour before Schumer spoke, Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a senior Republican in the talks, said it would be \u201cvery, very premature\u201d for Democrats to say the Zika language had been resolved. \u201cNone of this done until it\u2019s all done,\u201d Blunt said. Some senators and aides of both parties predicted a hand-shake agreement on the overall deal could be reached as early as Tuesday but others doubted the partisan divide could be bridged so quickly, especially since the deadline for the government to run out of money is not until the end of the month. With control of the Senate up for grabs in November, GOP leaders are anxious to wrap up the high-priority legislation and get their vulnerable members up for re-election home to campaign. Democrats denied Republican charges they were slow-walking a final agreement but privately acknowledged that they felt no pressure to accept a quick deal they didn\u2019t like just to let Republicans go home to campaign. Among the issues being negotiated, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is pushing to add language to the government funding bill that would prevent the US from turning over to an international organization control over Internet domain names. Some Democrats are pressing for changes to the Export-Import Bank board to get around GOP opposition to confirming open slots on the board, which is disrupting some operations of the bank. Other issues include funding for Flint, Michigan\u2019s water supply problem, disaster aid for states hit my major flooding, disclosure requirements for political giving by corporations, and the number of hours truckers are allowed to drive in a week to limit driver fatigue. Some GOP lawmakers have been pushing for aid to help with damage caused by the recent Louisiana flooding. But Schumer suggested that both Flint and Louisiana would need to be addressed in a separate disaster aid package, saying the GOP was blocking additional money for Flint in the government funding package. \u201cThey want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do Flint.\u201d Negotiators are also working to get offsets for the cost of the $1.1 billion Zika funding. Democrats initially pressed for it all to be considered emergency funding but there were signs they were prepared to meet GOP demands for some offsets.",

Elizabeth Warren said she understands why Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s tone in the election might appeal to \u201cangry\u201d voters \u2013 but she insists his solutions won\u2019t work if they\u2019re implemented. \u201cThe way I see this is that Donald Trump has tapped into something that\u2019s real,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s tapped into how angry people feel about that, rightly angry. The thing is Donald Trump\u2019s so-called solution just heads us in the wrong direction.\u201d The Massachusetts senator, who has endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president and is an outspoken critic of Trump, said that his method of campaigning has pinned dissatisfied voters against other groups in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s them,\u201d she said, imitating Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cIt\u2019s the people who don\u2019t look like you. It\u2019s the people who don\u2019t worship like you. It\u2019s about immigrants, it\u2019s about Mexicans, it\u2019s about women, it\u2019s about everybody else. It\u2019s about them.

And how does he know that? Because he has higher approval ratings? I mean, Saddam Hussein had high approval ratings too,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald Trump needs to remember that he isn\u2019t running for dictator.

But right now, money sloshing through the electoral process is making that impossible,\u201d she said. \u201c(Clinton) has said that she will work to get money out of politics.\u201d When asked if she would work as a watchdog of a Clinton administration, Warren said yes. \u201cHillary Clinton has laid out a progressive agenda. She laid it out during the primaries and she has stuck with it in the general. She has said, this is what I\u2019m running for,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way I see it, it is the job of the progressives to get her elected on a progressive agenda and then work our rear ends off to help get that progressive agenda enacted when she is president.\u201d Warren weighed in on the Zika bill that wasn\u2019t passed by the Senate after Republicans tacked on amendments that would have blocked Planned Parenthood funding and allowed Confederate flags to fly at veterans\u2019 cemeteries.

            "article_content": "The big battle over Zika could be coming to an abrupt end on Capitol Hill. A growing number of House and Senate Republicans now expect Congress will soon pass a $1.1 billion funding package to combat the Zika virus without restrictions on Planned Parenthood, a move designed to overcome a filibuster by Senate Democrats and end the pre-election season with as little drama as possible. Such a move would represent a win for the White House and congressional Democrats. No final decisions have been made, particularly in the House where the dynamics are more complicated than the Senate. But negotiations have intensified over the last several days and final votes could occur as soon as next week in both chambers, according to senior GOP lawmakers and Republican officials. The idea: To tie a must-pass bill to keep the government open beyond the September 30 fiscal year deadline with language to fund vaccines and research to combat the spread of the Zika virus. Senators are likely to reach such a deal, and many Republicans now expect the House to go along as well. Jolly uses jar of live mosquitoes to urge House passage of Zika funding \u201cI\u2019d like to put it together,\u201d House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, said of a Zika package and a bill to keep the government open. In a private meeting convened Friday by House Speaker Paul Ryan, a vast majority of the 50 rank-and-file Republicans who spoke favored approving a short-term stop-gap bill until Dec. 9, several attendees said. A short-term bill is favored by defense hawks and appropriators, giving them a chance to reprioritize and potentially boost funding for certain programs in the lame-duck session \u2013 rather than a long-term extension that would freeze lower levels of spending. \u201cI think the short term version is being strongly leaned to by the caucus,\u201d Rogers said. But doing so would anger House conservatives who are calling for any funding bill to be pushed off to next year \u2013 giving a new Congress and administration say in the spending decisions and avoiding action by a lame-duck Congress after this November\u2019s elections. \u201cI don\u2019t want a lame-duck,\u201d said Virginia Rep. Dave Brat, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, who estimated between 50 and 100 other Republicans would vote against a short-term measure. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be good,\u201d said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. \u201cWe don\u2019t think big spending bills should be landing in lame-duck. You\u2019re going to let people no longer accountable to voters deal with a big issue like that.\u201d But Congress is under enormous pressure to act on Zika funding in the wake of the outbreak \u2013 after legislation has been stalled over a round of partisan bickering. Senate Democrats have blocked a $1.1 billion funding bill three times, citing language in the bill to ease pesticide spraying restrictions and to exclude Planned Parenthood from the list of providers to help combat the spread of the virus, which can be sexually transmitted. Several Republicans exiting a morning meeting said it appeared increasingly likely that a clean bill \u2013 without restrictions on Planned Parenthood \u2013 would eventually be approved by both chambers of Congress. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re headed,\u201d said one senior Republican in leadership. But Ryan\u2019s office said discussions about a way forward were ongoing. Domestic spending is near 53-year lows. Yet Congress keeps cutting \u2026 \u201cNo decisions have been made by House Republicans, and the discussions will continue,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman. At the Friday meeting, Ryan laid out the various options for keeping the government open, while also expressing his preference to move smaller funding bills in an effort to avoid passing a major, omnibus spending bill at year\u2019s end. But he did not specify his preference for how to resolve the Zika stalemate. The discussions come as congressional leaders meet with President Barack Obama at the White House Monday, in an effort to discuss the remaining business before Congress adjourns later this month to campaign ahead of November\u2019s elections. And Senate Republicans, in particular, are eager to return home given they are defending 24 seats this cycle and want to be as visible in their home states as possible. Rep. David Jolly, a Florida Republican in a tough reelection race who brought a jar of mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus to the Capitol this week, said voters should \u201cfire all of us\u201d if Congress can\u2019t approve a clean funding bill this month. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get Zika funding by the end of September then we are nothing but a bunch of idiots,\u201d Jolly said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if I had to place my bet it\u2019s going to be what we see every year - we\u2019re going to have 100 Republicans committed to the \u2018governing caucus\u2019 side with all the Democrats and accept the responsibility that we hold, which is to fund the government. We\u2019ve seen this before \u2013 it\u2019s deja vu all over again.\u201d Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Charlie Dent said some members are still pushing to add controversial policy provisions that would make it difficult to pass. And in a swipe at some of these conservative members, he said, \u201cWe spend a lot of time around here taking advice from members who have no intention voting for bills.\u201d Dent wants his leadership to move ahead with a short term bill that includes Zika money and possibly an appropriation bill that both sides can accept. But he worried that the House will lose any leverage with the Senate if the internal GOP split stalls action. \u201cIf we have our usual circular firing squad discussions that go on ad naseum, then we\u2019ll get jammed,\u201d Dent said. \u201cAnd I think everyone is very much aware that that\u2019s a likely outcome. I\u2019d rather be doing the jamming than being jammed myself.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rep. David Jolly brought a jar of 100 mosquitoes onto the House floor Jolly urged lawmakers to quickly approve funding to combat the Zika virus Rep. David Jolly brought a prop Wednesday intended to buzz lawmakers into action on the Zika virus: A jar of 100 mosquitoes. The Florida Republican never opened the jar, but said on the House floor: \u201cI brought these mosquitoes here today to convey that fear and that anxiety of millions of Americans \u2013 Floridians.\u201d \u201cCan you imagine, colleagues, the anxiety in this chamber if these 100 mosquitoes were outside this jar, not inside this jar? Members of Congress would run down the hall to the physician\u2019s office to be tested. They would spray themselves before coming down here.\u201d Jolly said that anxiety \u201cis the fear of Floridians, right here.\u201d \u201cIt is not good enough to work on a compromise for months and months and months with no solution. The time for politics of Zika is over. The politics of Zika are garbage right now. The fact that candidates are going to spend money on commercials about Zika instead of responding together in a bipartisan, bicameral way in a divided government to a public health crisis \u2013 Americans understand that we are wasting time.\u201d Jolly, who dropped a long-shot Senate bid earlier this year, has incentive to push for action on the Zika virus: He faces a tough re-election fight against Democratic challenger Charlie Crist. During the seven-week August recess Congress just completed, Jolly said cases of Zika in the United States climbed from 4,000 to \u201cby some estimates more than 16,000.\u201d He represents Pinellas County, the home of St. Petersburg and Clearwater with nearly 1 million residents, and said his constituents \u201care scared.\u201d \u201cIn that fear, they are demanding action and they are seeing inaction. And in that inaction they are angry \u2013 angry,\u201d Jolly said. It wasn\u2019t the only Zika-related prop used Wednesday. A 5-month-old baby, Jackie, and her mother, Emily Holumbowich, the executive director of the Coalition for Health Funding, attended news conferences with House and Senate Democrats. Funding to combat the Zika virus has been a political football since Congress returned Tuesday. In the Senate, on Tuesday night Democrats blocked a Zika funding bill, complaining that it included a provision to prevent funding for Planned Parenthood and no longer included a provision in the House bill banning Confederate flags from veterans\u2019 cemeteries. \u201cRepublicans were more interested in attacking Planned Parenthood and flying the Confederate flag \u2013 can\u2019t make this stuff up, that\u2019s really the truth \u2013 than protecting women and babies from this awful virus,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said. Republicans, meanwhile, blamed Democrats for the continued stalemate. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain why \u2013 despite their own calls for funding \u2013 Senate Democrats decided to block a bill that could help keep pregnant women and babies safer from Zika,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The bills include funding to fight the Zika virus Democrats cite specific problems with each of the bills Senate Republicans and Democrats clashed Tuesday over how to resolve a handful of remaining bills before they leave for an extra-long summer recess at the end of the week. The heated exchanges were clear evidence that the high-priority bills were gridlocked and would have to wait until at least September for action. At issue are measures that on the surface don\u2019t sound that controversial: One would provide money for a federal public health response to the Zika outbreak, a second would set up programs to address the burgeoning opioid and heroin addiction crisis, and a third would fund the military next year as it stretches to respond to ISIS and other threats. Republicans are anxious to finish all the bills, which would be election-year evidence of good governing as they prepare to defend their slim hold on the Senate majority. At a minimum, Republicans want to demonstrate Democrats are responsible for stalling the bills. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me,\u201d said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican leader, \u201cthey would rather have a political issue than to actually have a solution.\u201d But Democrats cite specific problems with each of the bills and will block two of the three, reluctantly allowing only the opioid bill to make it to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk to become law despite being underfunded in their view. \u201cThe reality is, 1-in-8 opioid addicts in America today are in treatment,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the assistant Democratic leader, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s assertion that there is enough money in the opioid bill to tackle the problem. \u201cHe\u2019s arguing on the floor we have plenty of money to take care of this. Come to Chicago. Come to Illinois. Come to Kentucky and you\u2019ll know that\u2019s a ridiculous statement.\u201d But Senate Democrats\u2019 argument to hold up that bill to fight for more funding for the epidemic was undermined when the House approved the measure with a large bipartisan vote. On Zika, Democrats complained that a House and Senate GOP compromise tapped money from Obamacare and unnecessarily put restrictions on Planned Parenthood. \u201cThey put their ideological battle against Planned Parenthood, once again, ahead of their responsibilities as legislators to help fight a terrible virus,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington. \u201cNow, we are days away from a summer recess. They\u2019re still in their partisan corner.\u201d Republicans countered that the agreement, which had already passed the GOP-controlled House, was the fastest and surest way to approve much-needed funds to spray for mosquitoes and find a vaccine for the dangerous virus that can cause birth defects in infants. \u201cThis is the only way to achieve it,\u201d McConnell said. On defense spending, Democrats won\u2019t advance the bill because they believe Republicans are intent on underfunding domestic programs that are important to Democrats while boosting money for the Pentagon, a priority for many Republicans. If the defense bill passes now, Democrats warn, bills for other departments of government \u2013 such as education and health \u2013 might never get to the floor. But McConnell said more Defense Department dollars are needed now as Obama expands the military\u2019s mission in Afghanistan and elsewhere. He argued also that Democrats want to block the government spending bills to try to convince voters the Senate doesn\u2019t work under GOP control and Republicans should be voted out in November. \u201cWhat our Democrat friends are best at is creating dysfunction. Complete dysfunction,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWhen they were in the majority, they didn\u2019t want to pass appropriation bills. When they were in the minority, they don\u2019t want to pass appropriation bills. And they look for a way to make it impossible for us to do the basic work of government.\u201d Democrats also criticized Republicans for preparing to leave Washington without assisting Flint, Michigan, with its water crisis and inaction on gun control after a recent spate of mass shootings.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a new challenge to the Affordable Care Act At issue is the law's requirement that group health plans provide a full range of contraceptive coverage to women at no cost The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, has seen its fair share of challenges from likely suspects such as GOP political opponents, conservative think tanks and closely held for-profit businesses like Hobby Lobby. On Wednesday, however, the Supreme Court heard a challenge to the law from unlikely quarters: an order of nuns called the Little Sisters of the Poor. In court over 90 minutes of arguments, the justices appeared closely divided after debating the law\u2019s requirement that group health plans provide a full range of contraceptive coverage to women at no cost and a claim made by the lawyers for nonprofit religious groups that the requirement violates a federal law meant to protect religious freedom. Lawyers for the nuns as well as other nonprofit religiously affiliated groups told the justices that the so-called contraceptive mandate forces them to either violate their religious beliefs by providing \u201cabortifacients and contraceptives\u201d or pay ruinous fines. Although the Obama administration has offered them an accommodation meant to respect their religious objections, the groups said it is not good enough because it still makes them complicit in providing the coverage. They are seeking an exemption from the mandate similar to what has been provided to houses of worship such as churches. Liberals on the bench suggested that the government had reached a proper balance in the accommodation between respecting the rights of female employees to full coverage and the religious liberty concerns of the groups. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out that under the accommodation, it is the insurer or a third party who have an \u201cindependent obligation\u201d to provide the coverage which exempts absolves the objecting groups from having to do so. Ginsburg said that \u201cno one doubts\u201d the sincerity of the religious beliefs of the groups but that \u201cthere has to be an accommodation, and that\u2019s what the government tried to do.\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that she was worried \u201cbecause there are some women who don\u2019t adhere\u201d to the religious tenet of their employers and \u201chave a real need for contraceptives.\u201d Justice Elena Kagan also supported the government\u2019s decision not to offer the groups the same full exemption that it offered houses of worship. \u201cChurches are special\u201d she said. Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote could be key to deciding the case, seemed to agree with Kagan that some of the religiously-affiliated universities involved in the case should not be treated the same way as churches. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for this Court to write an opinion which says that once you have a church organization, you have to treat a religious university the same,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI just find that very difficult to write.\u201d But when Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli stood up to defend the accommodation, Kennedy asked him whether he would concede that the accommodation could be a substantial burden on the groups. Both Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts wondered if the government might be \u201chijacking\u201d the groups\u2019 plans. Roberts said that the government wants \u201cto use the mechanism that the Little Sisters and the other Petitioners have set up to provide services because they want the coverage to be seamless.\u201d He said that the groups don\u2019t object to the fact that people who work for them will have contraceptive services provided, they only object to having to provide the coverage themselves. \u201cThey think that complicity is sinful,\u201d he said. He also questioned why the groups wouldn\u2019t be eligible for an accommodation that had been made available not only to churches, but for some grandfathered plans as well. \u201cIf you have a lot of exemptions it undermines your argument that this is such a compelling interest,\u201d Roberts said to Verrilli. A decision is expected by July. This is the fourth time the Supreme Court has heard a challenge to Obamacare, and Wednesday\u2019s case is the second one to target the mandate. A ruling in favor of the nuns would not threaten the balance of the entire law, but their lawyers and supporters hope it will bolster their religious liberty concerns. The challenge actually consists of seven consolidated cases brought by the groups who lost in the lower courts. The oral arguments were the first related to Obamacare since the sudden death last month of Justice Antonin Scalia, who voted against the Obama administration and the Affordable Care Act in the three previous cases. The fact that only eight justices heard the case raises the possibility that the justices might end up equally divided, which would mean the court would simply affirm the lower court rulings at hand but set no national precedent. So far the government has prevailed in eight appeals courts across the country, but lost in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2014, a divided 5-4 court ruled that Hobby Lobby, a closely held for profit company, did not have to provide contraceptive coverage that violated the religious beliefs of the owners. Justice Kennedy joined the majority in that case and suggested the government could provide Hobby Lobby with an accommodation similar to the one at issue in Wednesday\u2019s case. \u201cJustice Kennedy was more skeptical of the accommodation today than he appeared to be in his concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby,\u201d said Gregory Lipper of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which wrote a brief in support of the government. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t write off his vote quite yet \u2013 he also seemed worried by the breadth of the challengers\u2019 argument, and he didn\u2019t make clear whether he thinks that the government has other ways to ensure that women get effective access to contraception.\u201d If they are split, the justices could also decide to order that the case be argued again next term with the hope that by then Scalia\u2019s seat will be filled. President Barack Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the bench, but Senate Republicans say they have no interest in holding hearings or voting on Garland before the presidential election. Carrie Severino, a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, tied Wednesday\u2019s arguments to the fight over replacing Scalia. \u201cAs we saw today, the Supreme Court is only one vote away from a five-vote liberal majority that would undermine religious freedom,\u201d Severino said, adding that she believes \u201cthe more likely outcome\u201d will be the court holding over the case until the seat is filled. In court papers, Verrilli argues that when Congress passed the law, it determined that preventive services for women were \u201ccritical\u201d to improving public health. As such, the Department of Health and Human Services determined that group health plans provide a full range of contraceptive coverage at no cost. The law exempts houses of worship from the mandate, but only offers an accommodation to non-profit groups who raised religious objections. Under the accommodation, a religious non-profit must first notify the group that issues its health plan, or HHS, that it has a religious objection. After the notification, either the insurance plan or a third party administrator becomes responsible for providing the birth control coverage directly. \u201cThe accommodation made available under the Affordable Care Act respects religious liberty by allowing objecting employers to opt out of the generally applicable requirement to provide contraceptive coverage,\u201d Verrilli wrote. He said the accommodation also respects the \u201crights, dignity and autonomy of female employees\u201d by providing \u201cfull and equal\u201d health coverage. But the groups say the accommodation is not good enough and would force them to facilitate and encourage wrongdoing. They say the government is violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 law that prohibits the government from imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise unless doing so is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest. In briefs, lawyers say they want an exemption from the law similar to what is already being offered to the houses of worship, some small businesses and grandfathered plans. \u201cTruly exempt organizations do not need to comply with the mandate at all,\u201d argues Paul Clement, a lawyer for the nuns, in court papers. \u201cThey need not execute or deliver paperwork empowering anyone to use their plan infrastructure to provide contraceptive coverage, nor even notify the government of their desire for an exemption,\u201d he said. In the courtroom, there were about 10 nuns sitting in the audience and a couple of Dominican Friars. Jane Roberts, the wife of Chief Justice John Roberts also sat in the front rows. Outside of court groups supporting the administration said the law protects affordable access to birth control. In a statement Planned Parenthood\u2019s Cecile Richard said: \u201cLike we did before the law was signed six years ago, Planned Parenthood will keep fighting for the right to birth control, no matter who your boss is.\u201d Opponents \u2013 including some nuns \u2013 demonstrated holding sings that read: \u201cHHS mandate: I\u2019ll have nun of it.\u201d Last year, when Pope Francis visited Washington, he took time out of his schedule to meet with the nuns. A Vatican spokesman said the visit was meant as a \u201csign of support.\u201d Wednesday marks the sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, and Alito \u2013 who has never been a fan of Obamacare \u2013 took a swipe at the law and the exchanges set up  to provide health insurance. The larger point he was making was that there were other ways to accommodate the religious liberty concerns of religiously affiliated non profits then to require their insurers to provide the coverage. \u201cSuppose that it were possible for a woman who does not get contraceptive coverage \u2026under a plan offered by a religious non profit.. to obtain a \u201ccontraceptive- only policy\u201d free of charge on one of the Exchanges?\u201d Alito suggested. Verrilli didn\u2019t think that was a less restrictive alternative. Alito pushed on: \u201cWhat type of a burden does that impose?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it because these Exchanges are so unworkable, even with the help of a navigator, that a woman who wants to get free contraceptive coverage simply has to sign up for that on one of the Exchanges?\u201d Later in the argument Roberts also launched an ever so subtle dig. He went back at the government for saying the exchanges wouldn\u2019t be a viable alternative. \u201cYou said, yes, it is a hassle to go to the Exchange, although it\u2019s \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve heard about how easy it is,\u201d Roberts said.",

            "article_content": "While the billionaire's willingness to buck convention has been a strength in the tumultuous 2016 race, it came with a downside Wednesday Trump is getting the cold shoulder from GOP leaders who see him as a toxic influence that could cost them the White House and Senate Super Tuesday winners expect better. But there\u2019s never been a presidential candidate like Donald Trump, and while the billionaire\u2019s willingness to buck convention has been a strength in the tumultuous 2016 race, it came with a downside Wednesday. Any other candidate would be embraced by his party as a conquering hero after Tuesday night\u2019s wins. Instead, he\u2019s getting the cold shoulder reserved for an especially obstinate unwanted guest from GOP leaders who see him as a toxic influence that could cost them the White House and Senate \u2013 and leave a stain on the party of Lincoln, if not tear it apart. Trump might have cemented his role as front-runner in the GOP race, but he now faces a tricky period as he tries to put the nomination truly beyond reach of his rivals, and not only the ones on the ballot. He faces accelerating efforts by conservatives and establishment figures alike to thwart his White House dreams at the 11th hour. \u201cWe all agree Trump as the nominee would be a disaster morally, politically, and electorally. Well, then, let\u2019s do something about it,\u201d prominent talk radio host Steve Deace, who has endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, wrote in a Facebook post late Tuesday. Trump, however, dismissed any suggestions at a Tuesday night victory lap press conference that he would be a divisive force in the party. \u201cI\u2019m a unifier,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me.\u201d Some lawmakers are also beginning to break with precedent and repudiate the party\u2019s front-runner. Nebraska\u2019s Republican Sen. Ben Sasse said over the weekend he won\u2019t vote for Trump even if he becomes the nominee. And Virginia GOP Rep. Scott Rigell warned on \u201cThe Lead\u201d with Jake Tapper Wednesday that he would not vote for Trump either, arguing that he lacked judgment on foreign policy and was not fit to be commander in chief. \u201cThis extremis moment that we are in, in our country \u2013 the solution is not Donald Trump,\u201d Rigell said. \u201cI truly believe he would harm our country.\u201d Yet many Republican voters feel differently. Trump enjoyed a seven-state romp on Super Tuesday to take his primary and caucus win total to 10. Traditionally at this point he\u2019d be wallowing in the plaudits of his party and tasting the power endowed by his first few hours as its presumptive presidential nominee. After winning a swath of states with diverse ideological, geographical and demographic profiles, like Trump has, such a candidate would expect his main foes to fold their campaigns to fall in behind him \u2013 especially in an election likely to feature Democrat Hillary Clinton, a rallying point for GOP hatred for decades. RELATED: GOP reaches a crossroads Instead, Trump must brace for a torrent of revelations from his own side about his business practices, his personality, what he really believes behind closed doors and questions on whether he\u2019s qualified to preside over a nuclear arsenal from opponents who balk at his takeover of their party. It could be an onslaught with far more punch than the nascent #NeverTrump meme on Twitter \u2013 started by Republicans. As an anti-Trump movement gathered force Wednesday, former Republican nominee Mitt Romney scheduled a high-profile speech on the race on Thursday in which he\u2019s expected to criticize Trump. GOP candidate Ben Carson pulled out of Thursday\u2019s Republican debate and told supporters in a press release Wednesday that he saw no path forward, in a move that could help Trump rivals Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who dropped his own presidential campaign before the Iowa caucuses, said he would back Cruz over Trump because Trump is an \u201cinterloper\u201d and not a real Republican. \u201cTed and I are in the same party. Donald Trump is an interloper,\u201d Graham told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him.\u201d And doubts over Trump are not confined to his politics in a year in which conservatives had high hopes of nominating the most ideologically pure nominee since Ronald Reagan. There is also deep skepticism among some conservatives about his behavior and explosive rhetoric as well. Many Republicans feel Trump\u2019s emotive language toward groups including Mexicans, women and Muslims is disqualifying. \u201cThis is a guy who has made, shall we say, racially insensitive remarks, things that conservatives who care about defending the cause of conservatism cannot in good conscience abide,\u201d said Matt Lewis, a CNN commentator and author of a new book that argues the Republican Party has betrayed its conservative roots. Donald Trump's Super Tuesday press conference Former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin that he hoped Romney would lead an effort to explain that the race is not over. \u201cTrump ought to take a pause. He lost four states last night, which shows he is vulnerable. He only has right now 300 delegates. He needs 1,237,\u201d DeLay said. DeLay is technically correct that Trump has yet to put the nomination out of reach of Rubio and Cruz. The theory of his opponents is that once more states hand out delegates on a winner-take-all basis after March 15, his lead of around 100 delegates over Cruz and 200 over Rubio could be overhauled should either of them start claiming more first-place finishes. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is also hoping to stack up delegates when the race hits the Midwest. At the very least, Trump opponents hope to prevent the real estate mogul from harvesting sufficient delegates to clinch the nomination before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in July. But Trump has advantages that could blunt any organized GOP bids to thwart him \u2013 just as he has succeeded in bending the contours of the presidential race to his will throughout his campaign. In his press conference on Tuesday night, he several times delivered a veiled warning to Republican Party leaders that they would be taking on more than just his campaign if they resorted to attacks on his character. \u201cBut remember this. I have millions and millions and millions of people,\u201d he said in a possible reference to his earlier warnings that he could bolt the party and mount an independent bid for president if he was not treated fairly. No other candidate has greater momentum or a greater claim to the nomination at this point. His closest rival, Cruz, has only won four states and Rubio just one. A bid to wrest the party banner away from his hands would risk alienating his fervent supporters, who might then repudiate any subsequent nominee that emerges. RELATED: The backlash against Chris Christie Furthermore, Trump\u2019s strength in recent Southern nominating contests suggests he will run strongly in primaries and caucuses in places like Louisiana and Kentucky Saturday and next week in Mississippi. The Rubio camp\u2019s theory that a victory in his home state of Florida on March 15 will buckle the billionaire\u2019s hopes of the nomination is undercut by a recent Sunshine State poll showing Trump with a clear lead. In another odd twist, Trump\u2019s loss in Texas, the biggest state of Super Tuesday with 155 delegates, may have actually helped him, since Cruz\u2019s win gave him a rationale to stay in the race. That ensures opposition to the billionaire will remain fractured for a few more weeks at least. And while it is possible to pick holes in Trump\u2019s path to the nomination, his route is far more credible than those of his rivals. Many pundits have long suggested that Trump has a ceiling of around 30% in the polls and would slump once the field narrowed. But he hit 49% in Massachusetts, 39% in Tennessee and 43% in Alabama on Tuesday. In a new CNN national poll this week, Trump reached 49% support among all Republican voters. Donald Trump: His own words In a bid to underpin his wins on Super Tuesday, Trump argued at the press conference that he was a \u201cunifier\u201d and took immediate aim at Clinton, possibly to help GOP voters envisage a presidential race that could bring the party together, its numbers swelled by new Trump voters. \u201cWe are expanding the party,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we get all of this finished, I am going to go after one person \u2013 that is Hillary Clinton.\u201d And in a possible sign of a tack Tuesday towards female voters important in a general election \u2013 who may feel alienated by his rhetoric \u2013 Trump noted that millions of women had been helped by Planned Parenthood, an organization reviled by conservatives. Still, not all of Trump\u2019s positioning appears to be working. If securing the endorsement of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was meant to confer establishment approval on his campaign, it backfired. The former GOP presidential candidate has been widely lampooned over a move that seemed to fly in the face of his previous criticisms of Trump\u2019s fitness to serve as president. And Christie became the subject of Twitter mockery over his apparent discomfort on stage during Trump\u2019s news conference on Tuesday night. And there were some warning signs in the results on Tuesday. Following predictions that he could sweep up to 10 Super Tuesday states, Trump had to content himself with seven. He faced a tougher fight in a crucial swing state \u2013 Virginia \u2013 than polls had predicted, in a sign that not all Republican voters are reconciled to having the former reality star as their presidential nominee. Exit polls showed that voters who made up their minds there in the last few days chose Rubio, a possible indication that the Florida senator\u2019s furious attacks on his rival\u2019s character and business record may have had an impact over the last week. \u201cFive days ago, we began to explain to the American people that Donald Trump is a con artist,\u201d Rubio told supporters in Florida on Tuesday night. \u201cIn just five days, we have seen the impact it is having all across the country,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are seeing in state after state \u2013 he loves to talk about polls \u2013 we are seeing in state after state his numbers coming down, our numbers going up.\u201d That kind of evidence may embolden Republican opponents of Trump \u2013 and a super PAC effort currently lining up against him staffed by establishment Republican operatives \u2013 to test what damage a full-bore negative advertising assault on Trump\u2019s character and business record could wreak on the billionaire\u2019s polling. But there is little precedent in this campaign for any effort by establishment figures to succeed in denting his hopes. It\u2019s even possible that efforts by the likes of Romney might do more to endear Trump with his loyal outsider base of voters than to harm him among traditional Republicans.

The author works at the institute. Conservative commentator tells CNN analyst he wouldn't vote for Donald Trump even in a race against Hillary Clinton He said a larger issue for Republicans than Donald Trump is the current fight over the Supreme Court Conservative commentator Erick Erickson, who has never been a fan of Donald Trump, said he wouldn\u2019t cast a vote for the Republican front-runner even if he wins the GOP nomination. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely not going to vote for Donald Trump, even if he\u2019s the Republican nominee,\u201d Erickson told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast from CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for the liberal who likes Planned Parenthood and universal health care, and I\u2019m not going to vote for Hillary Clinton either, but there will be someone whom I will vote for.\u201d The conservative pundit, who writes for The Resurgent website, said he expects the GOP race to take shape after Super Tuesday, with either of Trump\u2019s top rivals Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio forced to drop out. \u201cOne of them is going to have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think that you\u2019re going to see conservatives try to push Cruz out if he doesn\u2019t do well in Texas,\u201d he noted. \u201cEven if he wins, but it\u2019s close, I think they\u2019ll probably start rallying around Rubio.\u201d \u201cIf Ted Cruz can\u2019t win Texas, then he does need to get out of the race. But a lot of the conventional wisdom that he needs to get out, I think, isn\u2019t premised in fact. I mean, he\u2019s doing better than Rubio in Florida right now. He\u2019s doing better even than Trump in California in the Republican primary right now.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know that there is an impetus for them to get out. At this point it\u2019s become ego. I mean, they\u2019ve gotten along in the Senate for a very long time and I think right now they and their staffs hate each other, so there\u2019s no incentive for either to get out when they think that the other should get out, which is essentially handing the race to Trump.\u201d But there\u2019s something even more important going on in Washington, according to Erickson, who said he believes a bigger problem for Republicans would be caving to Democrats\u2019 demands to confirm a new Supreme Court justice before the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. \u201cIf Republicans cave, I mean, this would be more the end of the Republican Party than Donald Trump,\u201d Erickson said. \u201cBecause going back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s election in 1980, the Supreme Court has been the issue of the Republican Party. It comes up in every presidential campaign, every Congressional campaign, every even numbered year. If the Republicans were then to say this year - after years of saying, \u2018The Supreme Court hangs in the balance, you must vote Republican\u2019 - \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to go through with this,\u2019 it would be game over.\u201d To hear the whole interview with Erickson, which also touched on his upbringing abroad and much more, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

            "article_content": "Planned Parenthood is launching a coordinated on-air and digital ad campaign Thursday for Hillary Clinton in Nevada The support comes at a critical juncture for Clinton Planned Parenthood is mounting an advertising campaign in Nevada Wednesday on behalf of Hillary Clinton, as the former secretary of state vies for support ahead of Saturday\u2019s caucuses. The group will air three spots featuring three women talking for 15 seconds each about why they support Clinton. Planned Parenthood never mentions Clinton\u2019s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders by name. Sanders took heat last month after he dismissed Planned Parenthood\u2019s endorsement of Clinton as \u201cthe establishment\u201d supporting its own. Shortly after his comment, he began citing his support for Planned Parenthood more often on the campaign trail and also highlighted the 43rd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. \u201cThere\u2019s only one candidate in this race who has been an outspoken champion for women\u2019s health and rights for decades \u2013 and who has a real plan to not just protect the progress we\u2019ve made, but to keep expanding women\u2019s access to basic health care,\u201d said Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement to CNN. The ads, which were provided first to CNN, feature a white woman who was a former Planned Parenthood patient, an African-American woman who is a Planned Parenthood community health educator in Nevada and a second-generation Mexican-American woman. \u201cRemember, there\u2019s a lot at stake in this election. Hillary Clinton is a champion for women\u2019s health care. That\u2019s why Planned Parenthood Action Fund has endorsed her,\u201d says Reyna, a Mexican-American single mother, in one of the ads. Clinton is just barely leading Sanders, 48%-47% in Nevada, with just three days until the caucuses, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday morning. It\u2019s a marked difference from the last CNN/ORC poll of Nevada, taken in October, which showed Clinton leading Sanders 50%-34%. But the latest poll also shows that roughly one-third of likely Nevada caucusgoers has made their final decision between the two. Sanders has done well among younger women in both Iowa and New Hampshire, according to exit polling in both contests, forcing the Clinton campaign and their supporters to focus on shoring up her support there. RELATED: Clinton shows weakness among women But Clinton has continued to do well among non-white voters, who figure more prominently in both the Nevada and South Carolina contests. The latest Nevada poll found Clinton leading Sanders 56%-43% among non-white voters. And a CNN/ORC poll of South Carolina Democrats found Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d holding strong with the support of black voters, who back her over Sanders 65%-28% and women, who support her over Sanders 60%-33%.",

            "article_content": "\"While I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them,\" Fiorina said in a Facebook post The writing was on the wall after she didn't qualify for last week's ABC News debate Carly Fiorina is ending her bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The former Hewlett-Packard executive announced the decision on Facebook Wednesday after finishing seventh in New Hampshire\u2019s primary. \u201cWhile I suspend my candidacy today, I will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them,\u201d Fiorina said in a post. The writing was on the wall after she didn\u2019t qualify for last week\u2019s ABC News debate, and a last-minute campaign on her behalf to allow her in was unsuccessful. Fiorina\u2019s best moments of the campaign came in the first two presidential debates. She shined in the \u201cundercard\u201d for the first debate, hosted by Fox News, earning enough of a bump in the polls to make the cut for the main stage in the second debate, hosted by CNN. And then she handed in a strong enough performance in that debate to rise into the top-polling tier of GOP candidates. Those poll bounces didn\u2019t stick, though \u2013 fading slowly as Donald Trump dominated media attention, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz courted evangelicals and hard-line conservatives and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio worked to consolidate establishment Republicans. Fiorina also found herself facing a barrage of criticism from Planned Parenthood and its allies after her characterization during one debate of the undercover videos assailing the organization\u2019s handling of fetal tissue proved inaccurate. The real story behind the Planned Parenthood videos Her campaign was built on the argument that \u2013 as a woman with a lengthy private-sector resume \u2013 she was the Republican best suited to take on Hillary Clinton in a general election. Fiorina\u2019s willingness to attack Clinton \u2013 she once invited media to a press conference outside the same hotel in South Carolina where Clinton was holding an event just minutes later \u2013 could keep her in the running for the vice presidential nomination. Fiorina\u2019s disappointing performance in Iowa \u2013 she received 2% support there \u2013 was punctuated by her decision to skip her caucus-night party there, citing a snowstorm ahead, and head straight for the airport for her flight to New Hampshire. The 2016 race was Fiorina\u2019s second bid for political office. She previously for California\u2019s Senate seat in 2010, but lost by 10 percentage points to incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer.",

            "article_content": "83% of voters aged 18-29 chose Sanders, according to exit polls. Sanders also won 78% of first-time voters In a year that voters are craving authenticity and a break from the political norm above all else, Clinton's nearly three decades in the political limelight is a liability. The Iowa caucuses were days away, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign had tapped \u201cIn the Attic\u201d \u2013 a band of four 19- and 20-year-olds from Cedar Rapids \u2013 to warm up the audience before she, Bill and Chelsea took the stage. Two days later, the band caucused for Bernie Sanders. \u201cWe like Bernie, but we think Hillary is a solid candidate,\u201d Grant Blades, the band\u2019s 19-year-old frontman, told CNN in an interview in an effort to be diplomatic. Then 20-year-old drummer Tanner Parks dropped it, saying, \u201cOK, we are supporting Bernie.\u201d They aren\u2019t alone in choosing Sanders. Tuesday night in New Hampshire, 83% of voters aged 18-29 chose Sanders, according to exit polls. And those voters were a full one-fifth of the electorate. Sanders also won 78% of first-time voters. The only age demographic Clinton won? People 65 and older. New Hampshire primaries: 5 takeaways Clinton acknowledged the gap in her concession speech. \u201cI know I have some work to do, particularly with young people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will repeat again what I have said this week: Even if they are not supporting me now, I support them.\u201d The overwhelming support for Sanders \u2013 a disheveled 74-year-old who has spent two decades in Congress \u2013 among younger voters is perhaps the biggest challenge confronting Clinton\u2019s campaign in the Democratic nominating contest. It also underscores the problem with what Clinton represents: In a year that voters are craving authenticity and a break from the political norm above all else, her nearly three decades in the political limelight is a liability. \u201cHillary just seems like a normal Democrat, and Bernie seems a little revolutionary to me,\u201d said Jonah Hunt, an 18-year-old high school senior in Rochester, New Hampshire. For Clinton to win the Democratic nomination, or at least stave off a lengthy, damaging primary fight, she needs to win over those voters \u2013 and those she can\u2019t win now, she\u2019ll need on her side if she advances to the general election. The advantage for Sanders extends beyond support at the polls. His supporters have built social media campaigns \u2013 Twitter Bombs \u2013 designed to inject Sanders\u2019 campaign with thousands of new, small-dollar donations. Clinton\u2019s campaign aides have acknowledged they need to close the age gap with Sanders, but remain confident she will be able to win them over by speaking directly to issues that they care about, namely college affordability, social issues and women\u2019s rights. Aides also feel targeted rollouts like the one she made on campus sexual assaults in Iowa earlier this year will help. \u201cGo out there and talk to young people. She\u2019d be way better for them,\u201d Bill Clinton told supporters Monday afternoon in Rochester. Sanders had visited the same town just two days earlier, and had drawn local high schoolers to his rally at city hall. Al Spader, a 37-year-old sixth grade science teacher, said he ran into several of his former students there. \u201cHe\u2019s very genuine, and he\u2019s offering to help them out \u2013 and I think he\u2019s empowering them,\u201d Spader said. \u201cThey\u2019re actually understanding that message.\u201d His description of Sanders \u2013 \u201cgenuine\u201d \u2013 comes up constantly in interviews with young voters. \u201cBernie is really in touch with the middle class. I know Hillary claims that she is, but I really don\u2019t feel that. She\u2019s been wealthy for so long,\u201d said Gillian Under-Mochrie, 18. \u201cIt\u2019s just refreshing to see a candidate who really gets it.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign has turned to celebrities \u2013 namely Lena Dunham, Christina Aguilera and America Ferrera, among others \u2013 to court the generation Sanders has captivated. And the campaign has also tailored their media strategy to young people. Clinton joined Snapchat and now snaps about Planned Parenthood and other issues important to millennials. (Sanders, too, has targeted young people on Snapchat, with different themed filters each day leading up to the Iowa caucuses, and he benefits from a hugely active base of support on Facebook.) She has participated in interviews aimed at young people, too, like when she chatted with BuzzFeed\u2019s \u201cAnother Round\u201d podcast. And the campaign has engaged with Internet \u201cinfluencers,\u201d like working with Karen Civil and sitting down for an interview with Glozell Green. Chelsea Clinton \u2013 someone the Clinton campaign sees as an asset with younger voters \u2013 has also started to hit the trail for her mother, campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire and headlining fundraising events. And to be sure, Clinton has young supporters, too \u2013 some of whom attended an event at Grand View University just before the Iowa caucuses. They said what they\u2019ve heard about Sanders from fellow students makes them worry he\u2019d lose a general election. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s a socialist \u2013 that\u2019s probably the biggest reason I wouldn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d said Danni Finn, an 18-year-old elementary education student from Glenwood, Iowa. The generational divide \u2013 particularly among women \u2013 is the subject of an increasingly bitter battle between campaign surrogates and supporters. Clinton lost the vote among women Tuesday night, 44% to Sanders\u2019 55%, according to exit polls. The disconnect: Older women who waged the wars against sexism don\u2019t understand why the prospect of the first female president doesn\u2019t excite their younger counterparts; younger women see presidential politics as open to their gender now, so electing a woman in this election \u2013 as opposed to any that follow \u2013 doesn\u2019t seem pressing. \u201cThere is a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other,\u201d former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a rally for Clinton in New Hampshire. Then came a rebuttal from Emily Ratajkowski, a 24-year-old model who spoke at a Sanders concert and rally Monday night at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cI want my first female president to be more than a symbol,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "At rallies across New Hampshire, women from every generation have flocked to Bernie Sanders' events The former secretary of state lags behind Sanders by 11 percentage points among women As Hillary Clinton seeks to break that \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling,\u201d she is finding that \u2013 at least in this state \u2013 women voters aren\u2019t so eager to help her shatter it. And it\u2019s not just young women. At rallies across New Hampshire, women from every generation have flocked to Bernie Sanders\u2019 events. They sport \u201cGrandmas for Bernie\u201d buttons, laud him for his vision, and seem content to pass up the opportunity to put Clinton on a historic path to the White House, betting that there will be another chance down the line. \u201cThat ceiling will be shattered at some time and I just think it takes the right person to do that and right now she is not the right person for me,\u201d said Ann Kaiser, a gray-haired grandmother from Hampton, New Hampshire, who is supporting Sanders. \u201cI think she would be very vulnerable. She would be hit so hard, in so many sectors that I think it would be tough for her to win.\u201d Related: Frantic campaigning on eve of New Hampshire vote Kaiser, who said she voted for Clinton in the 2008 primary, attended a Sanders rally in Portsmouth with her granddaughter, who echoed her sentiments. \u201cI did start out this election supporting Hillary because I thought it\u2019s time to have a woman president \u2013 we just took a huge leap and bound, electing someone who is an African-American, why can\u2019t we have a woman?\u201d said Emily Smith, 19, also of Hampton. \u201cBut then Bernie ran for president and I loved his ideas. It\u2019s outrageous that I\u2019m going to be $80,000 in debt\u201d after college, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a political revolution and it\u2019s time to pay attention to the middle class because we\u2019re diminishing.\u201d The former secretary of state lags behind Sanders by 11 percentage points among women, 53% to 42%, according to the latest CNN/WMUR poll. Her struggle to attract women voters in the Granite State reflects Sanders\u2019 overall strength in the state that borders his Vermont home base; he leads her 61% to 35% in the poll conducted February 4-February 8. Still, Sanders\u2019 ability to win over women voters \u2013 long considered Clinton\u2019s strongest base \u2013 suggests that she could struggle to piece together a reliable coalition in upcoming states as well. For Clinton, it\u2019s a reversal from 2008, when in a mutli-candidate contest, she earned 46% of the women\u2019s vote in New Hampshire and won the contest by 2 percentage points. Women will likely make up the majority of Democratic primary voters in most states as they did in 2008, and winning those voters will drive overall success. In 2008, Clinton largely carried the women\u2019s vote in states she won and lost the women\u2019s vote in states she didn\u2019t. When she ended her campaign in June of that year, she told supporters: \u201cAlthough we weren\u2019t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it\u2019s got about 18 million cracks in it, and the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.\u201d Now, if she is to close the massive gap between herself and Sanders, Clinton will have to again solidify her support among women, starting with New Hampshire on Tuesday. As the campaign moves on to other states, she will particularly need to sharpen her appeal among younger women, who are more likely to back her than their male counterparts but, much like them, have broken for Sanders overall. To that end, the Clinton campaign has flooded New Hampshire with women surrogates hoping to wrap her race in the larger struggle for women\u2019s equality. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan told a group of Clinton volunteers that the \u201creal revolution\u201d is electing the first woman president. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota reminded that same group of \u201chow important this historical moment is for us.\u201d And in the last Democratic debate, Clinton framed her gender as an anti-establishment credential. But other attempts to court young women voters have not gone so well. Famed feminist and Clinton supporter Gloria Steinem had to backpedal this weekend after she suggested that young women voters flocked to Sanders to attract boys. Read more: Gloria Steinem apologizes for female Sanders supporters remark Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, repeating one of her most famous quotes, told young women that they should support Clinton and that \u201cthere\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other.\u201d And Bill Clinton chastised the band of online Sanders\u2019 supporters known as the \u201cBernie Bros,\u201d who have trolled Clinton supporters online. In one instance, the former president said, a progressive blogger who wrote a favorable column about Hillary Clinton was compelled to post it under a pseudonym out of fear of blowback from Sanders proponents. \u201cShe and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary and explain \u2013 just explain \u2013 why they supported her have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often, not to mention sexist, to repeat,\u201d Clinton said. Aiming to tamp down some of the online trolling, which has been chronicled by prominent women progressives like Joan Walsh, Mike Casca, Sanders\u2019 director of rapid response, tweeted last month: \u201cIf you support @berniesanders please follow the senator\u2019s lead and be respectful when people disagree with you.\u201d In a CNN interview with Jake Tapper, Sanders put it more bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting; we don\u2019t want that crap,\u201d he said. While Sanders has outpaced Clinton among white women here, he has yet to show any strength among a more diverse pool of women. Although there is little reliable polling of black and Latino women, two groups that will help decide the next contests in South Carolina and Nevada, Clinton is dominant among both men and women in those voting blocs. For instance, the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll in South Carolina shows Clinton leading Sanders among African Americans by 57 percentage points and, as in other demographic groups, women traditionally have higher turnout rates. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t had an opportunity to see how she is doing with women of color, so women of color\u2019s voices have been left out so far,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a political science scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Clinton has spoken out on women\u2019s issues for decades and most famously declared at a 1995 World Conference in Beijing that \u201chuman rights are women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d Because of her longtime support of feminist causes, she has been embraced by organizations like Emily\u2019s List and Planned Parenthood and supported by many historic leaders of the women\u2019s movement. Sanders has touted his \u201c100% Planned Parenthood voting record,\u201d and likened his grassroots campaign to the struggle for women\u2019s rights. Dittmar said Clinton has been better than her surrogates in trying to appeal to young women. She tells them she will support them even if they don\u2019t support her. \u201cShe does need to be careful about her surrogates and the people who are talking for her. We don\u2019t want it to be [that] young women don\u2019t know what they are talking about; that\u2019s not fair,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the generational divide and it\u2019s led to creating a narrative about who is more feminist, Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton. Well that all depends on how you define feminism.\u201d At Sanders\u2019 final rally of the New Hampshire race, supermodel and actress Emily Ratajkowski defended young women and feminists who support the Vermont senator over Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m here because I support Bernie Sanders; I\u2019m not here for the boys,\u201d she said, alluding to Steinem\u2019s remarks. \u201cBut yeah, I want a female president so that I can say to my daughter one day, \u2018You, too, can become president of the United States.\u2019 I believe in that symbolic importance. \u201cBut I have seen symbolism in election, symbolism that fails the people that so desperately need the action to make change,\u201d Ratajkowski added. \u201cI want my first female president to be more than a symbol, I want her to have politics that can revolutionize.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Laurie Garrett is a Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Four individuals in Miami-Dade and Broward counties have been infected with the Zika virus by local mosquitoes Laurie Garrett:  Yes, we all know Washington is dysfunctional these days, but this is about the nation's babies Local mosquitoes in the Miami area are carrying the Zika virus, and have infected at least four Floridians. In announcing this alarming news during a press conference Friday morning, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, added a sharp warning: \u201cThis is not just a Florida issue. It\u2019s a national issue \u2013 we just happen to be at the forefront.\u201d Now all the falderal typical of American outbreaks will commence: Political posturing, hysteria versus naysaying, conspiracy theories, demands for safety and care and a daily mounting toll of identified cases. And this year the hoopla will unfold against the background of one of the ugliest, most deeply divided election years in modern history. In Washington, House Republicans are likely gambling that the United States outbreak will be relatively mild, and GOP denunciation of the Obama administration\u2019s failure to swiftly juggle budgets to conjure funds for fighting the virus will garner public support. In the White House, the opposite is the case: Officials assume a severe outbreak is unfolding, and blame GOP refusal to allocate new money for the current vulnerability to the mosquito-borne disease across southern states. But please, Mr. Trump and Secretary Clinton, do not add Zika to your list of crazy political talking points. Four individuals in Florida\u2019s Miami-Dade and Broward Counties have come down with Zika infections, with no evidence of their having traveled to an area, such as Brazil, that has a florid epidemic, or of having sexual intercourse with a partner who so-traveled. While Florida public health investigators scour the counties in search of infected local mosquitoes and other people showing Zika symptoms, the Food and Drug Administration is playing it safe, calling for a halt of blood donations collections in the area. The Zika virus can be spread by Aedes aegypti mosquito bites, sex and blood transfusion. Zika can also be found in human urine, semen and saliva, and Florida authorities are now collecting urine samples from family members and neighbors of the four identified cases, hoping to determine how widespread infection may already be in the area. Skeptics will want scientists to capture infected mosquitoes, prove that they carry Zika and demonstrate that the insects caused the four identified cases of the disease: This is nonsense. For more than a year, scientists with Brazil\u2019s premier health sciences institute, Fiocruz  have collected mosquitoes, smashed them up in the lab and studied DNA in search of Zika virus genes \u2013 only days ago, on July 22, were they finally able to announce that of the 1,683 mosquitoes of various species captured in and around Rio during the city\u2019s huge epidemic fewer than three pools of aegypti (out of 198 pools of insects) contained Zika DNA. If finding a virus-containing mosquito is the necessary proof for action, thousands of humans could get Zika disease before disease detectives identify the smoking guns. Florida\u2019s Gov. Scott acknowledged this, saying scientists are chasing mosquitoes, but tough public health action must go forward, regardless. Zika symptoms of exhaustion, fever, skin rash and flu-like ailments don\u2019t occur in everyone \u2013 indeed 80% are asymptomatically infected, meaning Florida could have many more human Zika cases caused by local biting mosquitoes. Florida has identified 386 Zika cases so far, all acquired overseas or via sexual intercourse with a partner who traveled to a Zika-epidemic location: 55 of them are pregnant women. Florida authorities are taking the situation seriously, warning pregnant women not to leave their homes without insect repellent, testing hundreds of urine samples, and hunting for mosquitoes to test for viral DNA. Scott no doubt saw the threat coming: every health expert knew swampy, mosquito-infested Florida would get hit with Zika first. Like some dreadful slow-motion horror movie Scott and scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have for months watched the Zika crisis unfold across Latin America, the Caribbean, Puerto Rico \u2013 all the while expressing exasperation over the lack of congressional approval for federal funds to augment the state\u2019s $26 million emergency fund. Scott said he found Washington\u2019s partisan disputes over Zika funding \u201cprofoundly disappointing,\u201d and his consternation only increased when Congress closed for summer recess, having reached no Zika funding agreement, thereby leaving states to muddle through the nation\u2019s peak mosquito season without hope of significant federal support until well after Labor Day. \u201cThe federal government needs to show up and do their part,\u201d Scott said this week. By shuffling its budget around, putting other health programs on hold, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found $1.4 million this month for Florida, and is now trying to rob more of Peter to pay more to Paul in the form of another $5.6 million Zika grant. Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health is also taking funds from various other research pots to urgently fund pursuit of essential tools for the fight against Zika: a vaccine, treatment, a quick reliable diagnostic test, the clinical dimensions of Zika infection, and ways to determine in utero whether or not a fetus has been infected and/or damaged. Without hundreds of millions of dollars the NIH is executing the efforts on the fly, at the expense of valuable work on other diseases. All of this is nuts. Think about it: This isn\u2019t a sudden surprising pandemic slamming America with no warning \u2013 no, we have been watching it creep our way for months, public health officials have shouted from the rafters, yet Washington postured and shrugged. On Friday the CDC forecast that more than 10,000 pregnancies this year in Puerto Rico could be affected by Zika infections \u2013 ten thousand. Whether you are inclined to support a right to life position or Planned Parenthood the prospect of idly bearing witness to thousands of pregnancies that result in miscarriages or birth defects should enrage. Brazil\u2019s experience offers real lessons \u2013 if any politicians care to pay attention. Though the first cases of Zika disease and babies born with severe birth defects and microcephaly skull malformations were seen in one part of the country in October 2015, the nation\u2019s epidemic didn\u2019t peak until March 2016, six months later, by then causing 8,000 symptomatic cases per week, spread out over much of the enormous country. (Brazil\u2019s epidemic is waning now, as the Olympics approach, with fewer than 200 new cases seen nationwide weekly, as winter sets in and mosquitoes retire into hibernation.) Could Zika be the next HIV? And what began as a completely mosquito-spread disease morphed into an increasing burden of sexual transmission, accounting for much of the pregnancy tragedies in Brazil. It started as a handful of suspicious births of microcephaly cases in northeastern Brazil less than a year ago and has now spread to more than 50 countries and territories, basically circumnavigating the Southern Hemisphere of the planet. Four of those countries have possible endemic transmission, meaning that, like Brazil, they are overrun by local mosquitoes that carry and spread the virus. As winter drives southern mosquitoes into hibernation, our northern hemispheric summer is getting hot and steamy. The mosquitoes are coming. It\u2019s our turn now. CDC Director Tom Frieden told Time that, \u201cWe have an unprecedented health threat, and we don\u2019t have the robust resources that would enable us to respond most effectively. Without additional resources, this is like fighting a fight with one hand tied behind our backs.\u201d Top officials in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have shown me that activating money, transferring it between federal accounts or to state coffers takes months of federal bureaucratic work, as dictated by congressionally mandated accounting procedures. In the absence of an emergency fund for health akin to special reserves held under FEMA, the CDC and their bosses at HHS cannot swiftly conjure funds for Florida. But it isn\u2019t just Florida. It would be a grave mistake to imagine that Zika will confine itself to the seaside villas of Miami or the suburbs of Broward County. Look out, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, the Carolinas, and, yes, the District of Columbia. The pressure Floridians are now applying in pursuit of federal support will swiftly magnify, as counties from Cameron, Texas, to Monmouth, New Jersey, join the din, demanding help from Washington.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Stanley, a conservative, is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Timothy Stanley: Clinton and Trump are running against each other for president, but in many ways they are the same He says the similarities run from dying their hair to being New Yorkers, to being one percenters -- and under investigation Are Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump the same person? The normal test for that is asking if they\u2019ve ever been seen in the same room together \u2013 and, OK, they have. At Trump\u2019s third wedding. Clinton says she and Bill only went because they thought \u201cit would be fun.\u201d But it\u2019s more than that: Power also attracts power; egos are drawn to ego. And when chatting over a glass of champagne at the reception, they might have found they have a surprising amount in common. 1. Age. Clinton is 68; Trump turns 70 in a few days. They\u2019re both baby boomers and their lives followed two very \u201cSixties\u201d trajectories. Clinton, the young idealist, grew up to become a left-wing activist. Trump, the square WASP, grew up to become a filthy rich yuppie. They\u2019re like Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford in \u201cThe Way We Were.\u201d  Without the romance. Thank God. 2. There are some things they agree on. Seriously. Trump flirts with extremism but on many practical questions his instincts are moderate. Both candidates pledge to preserve Social Security. Both have found nice things to say about Planned Parenthood. Both think it\u2019s time to spend more on infrastructure. Both probably think Bernie Sanders is nuts. 3. They\u2019ve been on television since television was invented, or thereabouts. I was born in 1982. Clinton entered the Arkansas governors\u2019 mansion in 1979; Trump was making headlines for his real estate deals in the early 1980s. There hasn\u2019t been a year of my life in which one of these two wasn\u2019t explaining to Barbara Walters why they\u2019re misunderstood/innocent of all charges/fighting back/still happily married. Their lives are rolling episodes of \u201cThe View.\u201d 4. They\u2019re members of the 1%. Both rail against the iniquities of modern capitalism \u2026 and both of them have made a heap of money out of it. Clinton is thought to be worth about $15.3 million \u2013 an income boosted by speeches given to Goldman Sachs that were so boring that attendees say they can\u2019t remember what was in them. No one\u2019s ever said that about Donald Trump. His precise net worth is disputed: There\u2019s evidence he inflates it \u2014 a lot. But a man who flies everywhere in his own branded aircraft probably doesn\u2019t dine out on food stamps. 5. They color their hair. Sexism works both ways. Yes, women have to put up with the pay gap, but at least Clinton can fess up to using dye. Men, by contrast, try to pretend that they\u2019re just naturally cherry red. The evolution of Trump\u2019s hair is fascinating: from blond to ginger to gray and all the way back to a kind of dirty mustard. His bathroom sink must look like an artist\u2019s palette. 6. They\u2019re New Yorkers. Clinton has the politics: liberal, big machine. Trump has the machismo attitude. Of the two, however, Clinton distinguishes herself by knowing how to eat a pizza. With the fingers, not the fork. 7. They have marital issues. Clinton has had to suffer Bill\u2019s adultery. Trump\u2019s \u201cpublicist\u201d says he\u2019s irresistible to women, including a young Madonna. And he had an extramarital affair with Marla Maples when he was married to Ivana Trump. The same year Trump sued his ex-wife for a tell-all book, 1992, Clinton was on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to say she was standing by her man. 8. They face investigations for potential misconduct. Clinton for alleged use and abuse of government email. Trump for setting up Trump University, for which he is facing three lawsuits that argue the program defrauded thousands of people of millions. Former students say they were told they\u2019d be meeting the head professor himself only to be invited to have their photo taken with a cardboard Trump cutout. Someone should write a piece of speculative fiction in which both candidates wind up running for office from jail. 9.They share a lot family history. Clinton\u2019s grandparents were British Isles stock. Trump\u2019s paternal grandparents came from Germany and his mother was raised on an island in Scotland. So both the candidates are mostly the descendants of 19th century WASP arrivals but, and this is interesting, they both have daughters who married Jewish men \u2013 Ivanka Trump even converted. Incidentally, you know the federal judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, and who Trump calls a \u201chater\u201d because of his Mexican heritage? Curiel\u2019s father arrived in the United States in the 1920s. Trump\u2019s mother landed in 1930. Now who seems more American? 10. They are loathed by large swathes of the population. Trump has a net negative of -33%. Clinton only does slightly better with -21%. Both are widely regarded as untrustworthy. The only point of contrast might be how well voters judge that they lie. Clinton\u2019s fabrications are well polished: One senses that she could be trusted to lie on the world stage and not embarrass us. Trump\u2019s fabrications are more transparent but also more fun. He lies loudly. The magic beans he sells are \u201cgonna be huuuuuge.\u201d Yes, there are a lot of differences between Clinton and Trump \u2013 and the election probably provides the starkest choice in terms of personality and outlook in decades. But their similarities suggest that in many ways this election is business as usual. Clinton claims to be on the side of the little guy, but is far too rich and cozy with Wall Street to be a populist. And Trump talks about jobs, greatness and China \u2013 but made his billions in ways that some call unethical. Look beyond the rhetoric and America still seems like a country run by the rich for the rich. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of  \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are their parties' presumptive nominees As primary season winds down, Julian Zelizer looks at what it has taught us about their strengths and weaknesses Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump. Barring a big surprise, that\u2019s your choice of major party candidates in the November election, like it or not. And with almost all of the primaries behind us, we know a lot more about their strengths and weaknesses. As we head toward the party conventions in late July and as a result of the vigorous competition in the primaries, voters have a better sense of what to expect when Clinton and Trump perform on the national election stage. Here\u2019s a look at their pluses and minuses: 1. Fighter: Clinton, once again, has proven to be a formidable political fighter. She does not give in easily and can punch back hard in adversity. During her many encounters with Sen. Bernie Sanders, as well as during the congressional hearings into Benghazi, she has proved that she could do remarkably well when confronted by political opponents who question every word that she utters. Aside from the debates, she has proven to be a public official who can absorb many body blows, still maintaining her standing in the polls and able to attract votes. Her blistering speech last week warning about the dangers the nation, and the world, would face if Donald Trump had access to nuclear weapons painted him in a devastating light and goaded him into an angry response that seemed only to confirm her warnings. 2. Coalition builder: With the voting results in many primary states, Clinton also demonstrated the ability to build broad electoral coalitions in different parts of the country, something that will be pivotal in the swing states during the general election. This has been the key to her success against Sanders, who often had trouble reaching beyond his core supporters of younger, educated and independent voters. Clinton\u2019s appeal as a strong partisan leader has been a big attraction to different kinds of voters and she has been able to develop strong loyalties among groups such as African-American voters. Hillary Clinton clinches Democratic presidential nomination 3. Crusader for Democratic causes:  Clinton has shown that she can articulate and defend a robust Democratic domestic agenda even though she is often criticized by progressives for being too much in the center. Over the course of the primaries she has heard and seen the growing unrest in the Democratic electorate and the demand for a more progressive set of policies. She has been willing and capable of adapting by becoming more vocal on issues like the national minimum wage and a stronger health care system. While she needs to do much more work to convince many Democrats that she won\u2019t turn away from her promises, she has done well. 4.    She would be the first female president: This makes her candidacy truly historic. Although too often dismissed as the \u201cgender card,\u201d the possibility that Americans could elect a female president would be one of the biggest landmarks in American political history. The decision would mark a huge step forward in a nation where women were not even allowed to vote until 1920 and where gender inequality and sexism remains part of the national culture. 5. Ties to Democratic power centers: Clinton has developed strong relations with Democratic elected officials and candidates whom she is helping in Senate and House races. This is an important asset. Often dismissed by her opponents as representing ties to the \u201cestablishment,\u201d these connections will be instrumental to ensuring the best possible relations with Congress if Clinton is elected. Rather than shy away, she needs to make this part of her campaign case. Why Bernie Sanders shouldn't be Hillary Clinton's VP pick 1. Can she be trusted? The most essential problem Clinton faces has to do with trust. Some of the problem has to do with the legacy of her husband, who some Democrats felt betrayed them during the 1990s on issues like NAFTA and welfare reform. Yet Clinton has contributed to her low ranking for trustworthiness with the unusual way she handled her email as secretary of state, by setting up a private computer server outside the official system. 2. Hiding stuff: For all her savvy Clinton has shown a tendency to hide information rather than take the risk of being more open. This was evident in the way she handled the email controversy by giving a variety of different explanations and in her refusal to show Americans what she said in the infamous Goldman Sachs speeches. The perception of covering up the facts, even more than the alleged wrongdoing, has continued to create ongoing controversy and questions.  Moreover, the FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s handling of email is ongoing and it could adversely affect her reputation, even if the probe ends without charges being filed. What kind of commander in chief would Hillary Clinton be? 3. Where\u2019s the vision?  A key weakness comes down to what former President George H.W. Bush once called the \u201cvision thing.\u201d To be sure, the vision thing is often exaggerated. Candidates can sometimes avoid grandiose mission statements and do quite well. But at some level the winners in American history have inspired people to get behind their visions. This was certainly the case with Barack Obama, who drew millions into a campaign that promised to fundamentally change the course of policy and politics that had been undertaken by President George W. Bush, and with President Ronald Reagan when he called for a new era after the broken promises of the 1960s and 1970s. Trump has benefited from a concise slogan \u2013 Make America Great Again \u2013 while Clinton has struggled to come up with an enduring rationale for her candidacy. 'Why do they hate Hillary Clinton so much?' 4. Not a natural campaigner: Clinton has struggled to match the enthusiasm Sanders and Trump have evoked on the campaign trail and has even admitted that campaigning is not her strength, in contrast to Bill Clinton. 1. Master of the media: If there is one strength that stands above all others it has to do with the media. Despite blasting reporters in a recent press conference, Donald Trump has proven that he has a crafty feel for the way the modern news media and social media work, and has the capacity to shape and direct conversations in the direction that he wants. He has the uncanny ability to make   statements that will dominate news discussion for days and has a feel for the arguments that will capture attention. 2. Turning flip-flops into a positive: He has also learned to use the flip-flop to his advantage. Whereas many politicians, like Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry in 2004, have been greatly damaged by taking different sides of the same position, Trump often gets away with it. He says many different things, providing a little bit for many to agree with. He refuses to get pinned down when questioned about these inconsistencies. He has argued that flexibility is a positive, particularly in a president who needs to negotiate with Congress and leaders overseas. With Trump attack on 'Mexican' judge, has he hit a new low? 3. Willing to break the mold:   Trump is unafraid to advocate unorthodox views. In an era when many politicians, including Clinton, instinctively back away from any statement that defies the standard party line, Trump seems willing to do so with reckless abandon. And so far it has worked. He has made a number of arguments, such as staunchly defending Social Security or offering words of praise to Planned Parenthood, that would have doomed most Republican presidential contenders in years past. Given that voters think so little of the status quo, he has found more leeway by just being different than the politicians they heard in earlier years. Why Trump is the next Walter White 4. Speaks to alienated voters: He is a candidate who knows to speak to the anger that exists in the electorate. Like others who have come before him, for example George Wallace in 1968, he has a strong feel for the anger in the electorate and knows how to tap into this and is not shy about doing so. He is willing to say the things that some voters want to hear, even if there are potential risks in doing so, and he can connect with that anger in a way that has proven difficult for others, like Jeb Bush, or takes him into territory they would rather avoid. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any boundaries as to what kinds of rhetoric he is willing to use, as has been evident with his words about immigrants. 5.    Being an outsider at a moment people detest \u201cThe System\u201d: This is one way in which Trump can use his inexperience and distance from Washington to his advantage. At a moment when many voters don\u2019t trust anything in Washington, he can claim that he is not part of this city. 1   Flirting with extremism: Repeatedly Trump has made statements that demonstrate his willingness to court dangerous extremists in the electorate. He played word games when Jake Tapper questioned him about condemning the KKK. He has made statements about immigrants, women and Muslims that play directly to some of the most nativist, sexist and xenophobic parts of the electorate. His comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel, as well as his doubts that a Muslim judge could fairly decide the case, even led his more enthusiastic supporters, like Newt Gingrich, to dissociate themselves from such racist claims. On race and ethnicity, Trump has always been a divider 2. Unpredictable, erratic and angry?   Trump is unpredictable, he is erratic and it is unknown how or what he would do if he was in the White House. This means, at some level, he is a big risk. This gives Democrats a significant opening to play into the doubts of the electorate.  His hair-trigger temper has popped up several times, providing an unsettling image of what he would be like as the nation\u2019s commander in chief.   It also raises questions, as has been the case in his attacks on the judge handling the Trump University case, about whether he will be willing to work within the boundaries of the Constitution. Why I am backing Donald Trump 3. Lukewarm support from GOP establishment: He also has been unable to win enthusiastic support from many in the GOP. While the Never Trump movement was paper thin and didn\u2019t last, much of the support from Republicans remains lukewarm, a grudging acceptance that he is the only choice that Republicans will have. He will need the support of around 90% to 95% of the Republican electorate to win. He will also need high levels of voter turnout and strong ground mobilization to win in swing states, all of which remains in doubt at this time. 4. Controversy galore: He is saddled with an enormous amount of controversy and scandal, not all of which has surfaced. Just in recent weeks the discussions about Trump University and ongoing questions about why he won\u2019t release his tax returns, as well as alleged connections to organized crime, along with the many comments that can be dug up about his personal life, will remain a vulnerability. The best news for him is that the Clinton controversies of the past 25 years can cancel some of this out or at least neutralize it in the final vote. But there is a long history of controversy involving Trump and further scrutiny by the media could raise new doubts among voters. Donald Trump: The whiner in chief? 5. Weak on knowledge of policy issues: During the primaries Trump has often shown a very thin grasp of some basic policy issues. Sometimes it quickly became evident that statements he made about a certain area of policy were just wrong. And while it is true that he has been able to win the nomination anyway, ignorance can hurt when he faces off against Clinton, one of the smartest and most experienced people in the political realm. He has made baffling statements about allowing Japan and South Korea to have nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, he was stumped by a question about the nuclear triad and was confused by a question about \u201cBrexit,\u201d the upcoming referendum in which United Kingdom voters will decide whether Britain should leave the European Union, just to name a few examples. These strengths and weaknesses are likely to drive the dynamic of the general election, even though it\u2019s likely that new issues will arise. To be sure, there is room for candidates to work on some of their weaknesses and bring to the forefront aspects of their candidacies that have not yet been on the table. But the basic outlines of candidates do tend to become clear in the first phase of the election. We have learned a lot and have a much better feel for the key elements of the race ahead.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. S.E. Cupp: Donald Trump's decision not to debate Bernie Sanders deprives us of an enlightening spectacle She says Hillary Clinton would lose by being seen as forfeiting chance to stand up to Trump In what has felt like the longest, most grueling, soul-sucking election season in modern history, there finally seemed to be a bright spot. Trump v. Bernie: Yaaasss! Please! For a few days, we could amuse ourselves with the idea that Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump would debate each other. Can you think of a better gift? And it\u2019s not even Christmas. Late-night talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel played the role of Henry Kissinger in getting these two characters at least to say they want to come together in a televised debate before the June 7 California primary. And then, cruelly, Donald Trump dashed our hopes with his statement Friday afternoon that, \u201cit seems inappropriate that I would debate the second-place finisher,\u201d adding that the Democratic nominating process is \u201ctotally rigged.\u201d Trump says he will not debate Sanders So, back to reality. After all, Sanders has practically no shot at becoming president, and no matter what Trump would say at such a debate it would be unlikely to have any effect on his poll numbers. Trump predicted it would be a ratings bonanza. Sanders tweeted, \u201cI am delighted that @realDonaldTrump has agreed to debate. Let\u2019s do it in the biggest stadium possible.\u201d I am delighted that @realDonaldTrump has agreed to debate. Let\u2019s do it in the biggest stadium possible. Trump said he would do it for charity \u2013 \u201csomething over $10 million\u201d \u2013 which he and Sanders would donate to \u201cmaybe women\u2019s health issues or something.\u201d Planned Parenthood, perhaps? This now-dashed debate had something for everyone. Who in the world really wants Donald Trump to win? If you want to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d you\u2019d likely revel in the expert counterpuncher\u2019s savvy swings at the self-described Democratic socialist. I wanted to see Trump call Sanders \u201cSwedish Bernie\u201d or \u201cComrade\u201d once or twice. For Sanders\u2019 critics, who assert he can\u2019t deliver on all of his unrealistic campaign promises, Trump have done them proud. \u201cFree college? Trust me, Bernie, as a businessman, I know \u2026 nothing\u2019s ever free.\u201d If you\u2019re feeling the Bern, imagine how deftly the senator would have been able to expose Trump\u2019s total ignorance on domestic and foreign policy? Sanders could have finally explained to Trump that he can\u2019t overturn the Geneva Conventions, that he probably shouldn\u2019t unilaterally arm Saudi Arabia with nukes, and that he might want to brush up on the policies he says he supports. A joint event would have allowed these two to bro out from time to time. They share similar positions on trade, Super PACs, and preserving Social Security. They are both anger candidates who made the calculation not to quell their constituents\u2019 fears but to foment them. Both emerged unexpectedly as contenders despite most election watchers\u2019 dismissals. If they had debated, we could have expected to hear the words \u201crigged system\u201d as many times as both candidates like to say, \u201cYuge.\u201d And just this week, Trump told Bloomberg Politics he wants to make the GOP the \u201cworker\u2019s party.\u201d Music to a socialist\u2019s ears. Hillary Clinton's shrinking email defense Erica Jong: Why I trust Hillary Clinton The news of Trump\u2019s decision not to debate had to be a rare sweet moment for Hillary Clinton, who decided she didn\u2019t want to do another debate with Sanders before California, where polls show her an embarrassing defeat to the Vermont senator is a possibility. The Sanders/Trump debate retaliation would have been sososo evil-genius, locking her out of a huge story, a big ratings event, and, to be less cynical, an important conversation. It would have elevated Sanders to be debating the Republican nominee with Clinton nowhere in sight, and make her look weak for ducking an opportunity that Trump is tough enough to take on. In a contest between Trump \u2013 who can\u2019t tell us what exactly he plans to accomplish as president \u2013 and Sanders, who can\u2019t tell us how, it\u2019s hard to say who would have emerged the winner here. But one thing is certain. As marketing goes, this would have been P.T. Barnum\u2019s \u201cGreatest Show on Earth.\u201d Note: This article has been updated with news of Donald Trump\u2019s decision not to debate Bernie Sanders.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Stanley, a conservative, is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Tim Stanley: Trump won Super Tuesday, but GOP still tearing itself apart as it tries to stop him; its best hope, Rubio, didn't come close Congressional Republicans may break with Trump if he wins; they're missing point that voters have made plain, he says GOP must acknowledge issues Trump has raised and build some kind of constructive partnership with his voters. Donald Trump won Super Tuesday. All other analysis feels like a distraction at this stage. He is ahead. He is the dominant candidate Yet, despite this, the GOP continues to throw everything it\u2019s got at the front-runner. And continues to tear itself apart. It\u2019s become a kind of madness. The Virginia primary result was a good illustration of the mood of the Republican Party. Here was a chance for Marco Rubio really to break through. He was doing well among late deciders. But as the evening wore on and the votes came in, it became obvious he wasn\u2019t going to do it. Rubio won the college educated, the overspill from Washington  and the wealthy. But Trump dominated among rural dwellers and in the suburbs. Some analysis says that John Kasich stole enough votes to deny Rubio the state, but why assume that all of Kasich\u2019s voters would\u2019ve backed him? By the time Virginia was called, one could feel the momentum drain away from Rubio \u2013 even as he would go on to win one state: Minnesota. Will the energy ever come back? It\u2019s hard to see how or why. He\u2019s enjoyed every advantage: a week of great headlines, the support of the establishment, a consensus that he\u2019s the best placed to beat Hillary Clinton. Despite this, he failed to make his mark on Super Tuesday and is trailing Trump in his home state of Florida. Hillary Clinton wins tennis match while GOP keeps mud wrestling And yet the only alternatives left in the race are John Kasich, with little appeal outside the North, and Ted Cruz, whom moderates broadly despise. The most rational thing to do right now might be for Kasich and Rubio to drop out and back Cruz \u2013 the anti-Trump person who has won the most. And yet the most rational thing doesn\u2019t even seem to be on the table. We know that the GOP is looking for answers. Insiders have tried to persuade others to drop out \u2013 an approach that has been stymied by ego. How else to explain the absurd statement by Kasich\u2019s chief strategist that: \u201cRubio\u2019s presence in the race is keeping Republicans from consolidating around Governor Kasich\u201d? Other party bosses have started to raise money for an anti-Trump PAC; some are preparing for a brokered convention. Given that so many delegates are distributed proportionately, this is not a bad Plan B. Although it\u2019s hard to imagine that Rubio would be the main beneficiary, given that he did so badly in the primaries. Why crown a loser? Most depressing, however, are the plans by congressional Republicans simply to break with Trump in the event of a general election. They\u2019ve done the math. They\u2019ve seen the polls that put Trump way behind Hillary Clinton and they know he could cost them dearly. Better, they think, to cauterize the nomination \u2013 let Trump have the presidential ticket, cut him off and stop the poison contaminating them. But the bigger, existential problem they face is that Trump\u2019s rise has told them things about their voters that they weren\u2019t ready to hear and don\u2019t know how to respond to. It is surely significant that so many have voted for a candidate who is willing to soften his words on Planned Parenthood, who thinks that the Iraq War was a huge mistake or who won\u2019t reform entitlements. Is Donald Trump another Barry Goldwater? On policy, Trumpism is often more moderate than orthodox conservatism. In tone, however, it is considerably cruder. This is old-fashioned populism: an economic platform that is intended to help Middle America, even if its economic illiteracy ends up hurting the entire country. In 2016, conservatives might have to surrender to Trump and/or find some way of distancing themselves from him. But in the long run, they have to acknowledge the issues he has raised and build some kind of constructive partnership with his voters. Republicans and a few crossover Democrats are defecting to Donald Trump. He is huge, and he isn\u2019t going away. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Richard Gabriel is President of Decision Analysis, a national trial consulting company. He is the author of \u201cAcquittal: An Insider Reveals the Stories and Strategies Behind Today\u2019s Most Infamous Verdicts.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Would presidential candidates say false things if they had to swear to them under penalty of perjury? Richard Gabriel: We should set higher standards for our presidential candidates Was Donald Trump correct when he said that thousands of Muslims were cheering in Jersey City when the World Trade Center came down on September 11, 2001? Was Hillary Clinton correct when she said the gun industry was the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability? Was Carly Fiorina correct when she said that a Planned Parenthood video showed a living, kicking fetus with someone saying, \u201cWe have to keep it alive to harvest its brain\u201d? The answer to all three is of course not. Yet, there were no consequences to the candidates for these untrue and misleading words. The question we should ask is \u2013 why not? Would these presidential candidates have said these things if they had to swear to them under penalty of perjury? In a court of law, lawyers are officers of the court and have a professional responsibility to not misstate the law or mislead the court. This applies to them 24/7 in all of their activities, not just when they practice law. Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton lost their law licenses for their conduct in office and not because of anything they did as practicing attorneys. While attorneys do not have the greatest reputation among the American public, their peers and judges often hold them accountable if they make misrepresentations. In a court of law, an attorney has to submit both evidence and law that is relevant to their case. If they misstate the facts or law, a judge can sanction them with fines, limit or even dismiss their case. They can be subject to disciplinary action and even lose their license to practice law if the infraction is severe. In a court of law, witnesses who lie or knowingly misrepresents facts or their expertise can be subject to contempt of court ruling and prosecuted for perjury, potentially incurring fines or even jail time. Why don\u2019t we have the same standards for our presidential candidates? First Amendment rights are absolute when it comes to political speech, and we want candidates to speak freely about the issues. However, a candidate is not just a citizen; he or she aspires to be the commander of an entire nation. As representatives who aspire to lead our country, their comments prompt national dialogue on war, the environment, and health care. They shape public opinion on important issues and when they are on the stump discussing their policy positions, their words should be held to the highest standard of truth. Donald Trump should be held accountable for his position on Muslims. Hillary Clinton should be accountable for her position on guns, and Carly Fiorina should be accountable for her statements about Planned Parenthood. As in a court of law, they should have to prove their case and be responsible for the accuracy of their evidence. They are officers in the court of public opinion and should have attendant responsibilities as a prospective representative. This is not to say that a candidate cannot frame a statement as their belief. When Donald Trump says he can shoot someone and not lose voters or when Ben Carson says that he thinks that Obamacare is the worst thing to happen to this country since slavery, they are stating their opinions, no matter how extreme or bizarre their beliefs may be. In our current field of presidential candidates, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Martin O\u2019Malley and Rick Santorum are all lawyers. All are bound by ethical rules and professional responsibilities, whether they are in the courtroom or on the campaign trail. But even though the other candidates are not lawyers, why shouldn\u2019t all those seeking office not only be held up to a professional code of conduct, but to the standard of a sworn witness in a court of law? When Ted Cruz says he lost his health care because of Obamacare or Bernie Sanders says that \u201calmost all\u201d polls suggest he would be a stronger candidate against the Republicans than Hillary Clinton, voters take these as statements of fact. And voters, just like jurors, are relying on the accuracy of candidates\u2019 statements to make an informed choice that is at the very heart of their citizenship. The significant increase in the whoppers being told this political season indicates that candidates feel they can say almost anything with impunity because they face little or no consequence for their misstatements, half-truths, or outright lies. Rather than lose credibility, some of the candidates \u201cdouble down\u201d on their comments and have actually experienced poll bumps for their extreme and inaccurate statements. Campaign strategists, political consultants, and think tanks for both parties are relying on social science and propaganda research to further the cynical view that truth need not matter in the political arena. A social science study published last year on the \u201cillusory truth effect\u201d in the Journal for Experimental Psychology has shown that even when we know something is false, if we hear it repeated enough times, we start to believe it is true. We demand professional standards from doctors, lawyers, scientists, engineers and even real estate agents. The NFL and NBA have the power to fine, suspend and even ban players for bad conduct, both on and off the court. Why can\u2019t we have a set of standards and a code of conduct for our elected officials? While an actual legislative system to review and sanction candidates for their statements is untenable and probably unconstitutional, we the public should demand an \u201cunder oath\u201d and \u201cqualified or unqualified\u201d report card standard for those running for office. With an estimated $5 billion that will be spent on the 2016 election season, we have commoditized our candidates, polishing and packaging them as products so that their commercials, debates and social media feeds blend into the information environment of television series, car commercials, and fast-food ads. With candidates hurling accusations at each other and vying for prime media stage time, it\u2019s easy to dismiss their lies as part of the political theater. Our resignation and cynicism has cost us dearly as we see a steady erosion of public trust for our elected representatives. In a Pew Research Center poll conducted last November, only 29% of respondents said they would describe elected officials as honest. In a Gallup poll conducted in June of last year, only 8% of the public stated that they had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in Congress. Routinely, Politifact, FactCheck and other news organization rate the statements of our politicians as \u201cHalf True,\u201d \u201cMostly False,\u201d and \u201cPants on Fire.\u201d Our choice of a new president should inspire trust in our leaders. By accepting false or even partially true statements, we are selling our elected officials, our political process, and ourselves short. Let\u2019s not turn this \u201cfact optional\u201d election season into our new norm. We should be more engaged and more vigilant with our national conversations. Even if we can\u2019t formally regulate political speech, we should set standards and tell the candidates that we consider everything they say to be an oath for which they will be held accountable. Only then will we get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

The presidential election wasn\u2019t the only contest to see an upset. Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian, who came to national attention for heftily fining a local bakery that refused to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple, lost.  Avakian, a champion of the LGBTQ community, was running for Secretary of State. As labor commissioner since 2008, Avakian often made news for his tough calls against businesses discriminating against gay and transgender customers. The most noteworthy was when Sweet Cakes by Melissa refused to make the wedding cake for the same-sex couple in 2013, citing the owners\u2019 religious beliefs. Shop owners Melissa and Aaron Klein were ordered to pay $135,000 in emotional damages. They were also told they couldn\u2019t refuse customers based on sexual orientation. Melissa Klein claimed the ruling stripped the couple of their First Amendment rights. \u201cAccording to the state of Oregon we neither have freedom of religion or freedom of speech,\u201d she said in a Facebook post at the time. \u201cSweet Cakes by Melissa\u201d eventually shut down completely, though their Facebook page remains active. Avakian was also responsible for slamming a $400,000 fine on a Portland bar owner who refused service to transgender customers, according to the Oregon Live. In his bid for Secretary of State, Avakian promised a push for \u201cprogressive values\u201d like wage equality and reproductive freedoms. His conservative opponent promised to adhere to the position\u2019s basic, more traditional roles, like auditing public records and officiating elections. In the end, the opponent, Dennis Richardson won 48% of the popular vote, beating Avakian by nearly 100,000 votes. The victory makes Richardson the first Republican to win a statewide office in Oregon since 2002.",

            "article_content": "Thousands of atheists turned out Saturday on a muggy Washington day to take part in \u201cReason Rally,\u201d dedicated to boosting the political power of the growing number of non-religious Americans. \u201cWe are here, we are one, we are joined and we are celebrating our secular movement and we want more of this in our government,\u201d said rally attendee Doc Gregory, from Hagerstown, Maryland. Signs and slogans bearing atheist slogans \u2013 \u201cI think therefore I\u2019m Atheist\u201d \u2013 proliferated on the National Mall as musical guests and promotional videos played on stage. A small group of protesters stood nearby, holding signs that said \u201cGod Doesn\u2019t Believe in Atheists.\u201d \u201cScience Guy\u201d Bill Nye, comedian Lewis Black and members of the hip-hop collective the Wu-Tang Clan were part of a high-profile lineup preaching to atheists at the Lincoln Memorial. The coalition of secular organizations hoped for a turnout of 30,000 people, though the attendance seemed somewhat more sparse. Still, the speakers seemed inspired by the setting: the Lincoln Memorial, the site of Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, among other historic moments. \u201cI have dream that some day children are encouraged to reach their full potential by providing them with the tools they need to learn and encouraging them to question everything,\u201d said Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and atheist activist. Other participants called for a non-religious approach to politics amid a hotly contested presidential campaign. They also hoped to flex the political muscles of the religious unaffiliated, turning one of the fastest-growing groups in the country into a powerful voting bloc. In an informal survey of the crowd, Bernie Sanders, who has called himself a \u201cnon-religious\u201d Jew, was the standout favorite. The Book of Bernie: Inside Sanders\u2019 Unorthodox Faith \u201cHe seems to be the only candidate that really cares about everybody,\u201d said Brenda Germain, from Aberdeen, North Carolina. Germain, a member of the group Military Atheists and Secular Humanists of Fort Bragg, was at the rally with her husband, an Air Force veteran. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of watching our politicians pandering to the religious and ignoring us as if we don\u2019t even exist,\u201d Germain said. While the rally featured musical entertainment, flashy speakers and late-night cocktail hours at neighboring hotels, the thousands of \u201cnones\u201d \u2013 people who don\u2019t identify with any religion \u2013 coming to the nation\u2019s capital also have a more serious agenda. The Reason Rally is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a political event, said executive director Lyz Liddell. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we\u2019re holding this in an election year. We want to see reason taking precedence over religious-driven ideology.\u201d Our Executive Director, @lyzmaytweet, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial! Soon... #ReasonRally #WashingtonDC pic.twitter.com/tdan204LOm The rally\u2019s major political issues are climate change, reproductive rights and LGBT equality, all hotly contested political topics whose opposing voices often come from the religious right. Larry Decker, executive director of the Secular Coalition for America, said his group scheduled meetings with more than two thirds of the members of Congress, whom they hope to lobby on behalf of secular values. They also hope to soften some of the social stigma still attached to the \u201catheist\u201d label. According to a Gallup poll, 40% of Americans would not vote for an atheist president, though that number has declined in recent years. Gallup: Record number of Americans would vote for an atheist president What happened to God in America? There is a \u201csmall vocal group of people in this country who have really demonized what atheist means,\u201d Decker said. But while organizers hope to distance religion from the conversation, the rally\u2019s attendees and speakers include people of faith, notably such legislators as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia. \u201cIt would be great if we get proportionate representation in Congress, but we are being represented by religious members of Congress and we want to work with them. We want to be heard by them,\u201d said Liddell. Gabbard said that, as a U.S. soldier serving in the Middle East, she witnessed \u201cendless\u201d conflicts driven by religious sectarianism. Bigotry based on faith also occurs closer to home, the congresswoman continued, citing conservative who insist that President Obama is Muslim, despite his frequent invocations of his Christian faith. \u201cA pluralistic, secular government is the only way to ensure that all individuals have the freedom to follow the religious path of their choice,\u201d said Gabbard,  who is the first and only American Hindu elected to Congress. When Gabbard ran for Congress in 2012, her opponent argued that she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to serve because her religion doesn\u2019t \u201calign\u201d with the Constitution. The last Reason Rally, held in 2012, may have had a much more excluding vibe, Liddell said. \u201cSome of our speakers were anti-theists and anti-religion.\u201d This year, she said, the focus has shifted to secularism. \u201cWe need to ally with people who share our goals. It\u2019s not an \u2018atheist vs religious people\u2019 conversation.\u201d Decker himself identifies as an unaffiliated Christian. But even so, \u201cI really feel more comfortable in this community,\u201d he said. Secularists might be the only group that sees hope in a presidential election so rife with vitriol because religious identity hasn\u2019t been a big part of either party\u2019s leading candidates, said Reason Rally organizers. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to see that we\u2019re not looking at one religious group as the primary influence in elections,\u201d Liddell said. Decker said it was good thing when Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich dropped out of the presidential race because they were among the candidates who had invoked God in their reason to run for president.",

Martha Pease: Allegations about Trump's behavior toward women could cost him the election But Trump may start nation down the path of finally deciding, once and for all, to treat women as equals, Pease says With three weeks left before election day, most Americans are asking whether there\u2019s any silver lining to this mess we call a presidential campaign. And perhaps there is. The \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording \u2013 which captured Donald Trump\u2019s raw, predatory approach toward women \u2013 sparked controversy concerning the Republican nominee. This political firestorm was only further fueled by the stream of women who have come forward with allegations of sexual assault in the wake of this scandal, and Trump\u2019s inflammatory response to these claims. This situation could cost Trump the election. Yet in an ironic twist, the world\u2019s most notorious misogynist may start the nation down the path of finally deciding, once and for all, to treat women as equals.  What an unexpected blessing that would be! Without intending it, Trump has brought us the ultimate reality show, revealing what is really said behind the scenes among men seeking power over women.  A predator one can see can at least be confronted, but a predator who lurks in the shadows \u2013 or, rather, in the case of Trump and Billy Bush, on the luxury bus \u2013 is hard to identify and even harder to stop. Trump's new problem: He's becoming a bore Trump\u2019s casual description of stalking and thrusting himself upon unsuspecting victims is, for many women, an ugly reminder of the worst moments of their lives.  And for many men, especially younger ones, it has yanked back the curtain and revealed the brutal underbelly of misogyny and how the instigators of actions like these are often hidden from sight. For women and men, this episode has been a wakeup call. The intensity of voter reaction may also be fueled by the intimate nature of the topic.  Unlike other important feminist moments in our history, this is not about groups of women acting out in protest by burning bras, or even marching for reproductive rights.  This one is about bodies, about each woman\u2019s and girl\u2019s individual right to expect that hers is off limits to anyone she doesn\u2019t want touching her. Unlike older generations, young men today have a keener sense of justice when it comes to women and their right to physical security. In my own household of millennial men, the case of the former Stanford swimmer, who was convicted of rape but given only the lightest of sentences,  was greeted with anger and outrage. The point is that elevating sensitivity around sexual assault and rape culture \u2013 whether proven in court or captured on tape \u2013 is beginning to bring about significant changes in attitude. Why this expat can see beyond Trump's personal flaws It is way too early for proponents of women\u2019s rights to declare victory.  Even as some polls show Hillary Clinton opening up a huge lead among women, a Washington Post-ABC poll taken nine days after the scandal had reached its peak found that 63% of all likely voters say the contents of the Trump tapes would not affect their vote. While this is certainly not a hopeful figure, a number of signals do point in an optimistic direction and that suggests widespread change can happen. First, people do seem more ready to make this issue both a personal and a public one. Michelle Obama is at the head of that line, testifying from her powerful  and personal perspective that aggression toward women is simply unsupportable in our society.  After the Trump tapes were revealed, author Kelly Oxford tweeted about her own sexual assault experience, and encouraged others to do the same. More than 30 million people either left a response or visited her Twitter page over the past week. There have been other moments in history when a national conversation like this moved from the institutional to the personal level, which in turn shifted the balance of power as well. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. used the personal testimony of black Americans to drive the civil rights movement forward, and Nelson Mandela used the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to move South Africa toward unity. When painful confrontation like this begins, change is often not far behind. Women also seem to be taking action. There has been widespread acknowledgment that these misogynistic actions occur for a while now, but the latest push is one that is distinctively toward attitudinal change: a sense that it\u2019s time for men like Trump to move on and that women are done tolerating the status quo. Some of the subtle realities of sexual harassment are also being discussed and considered more openly. The truth is coming out that when it comes to facing the comments of men who behave like Trump, women often have to choose whether they want success or the emotional satisfaction of confrontation. Even Ivanka Trump admitted she faced aggressive behavior like this from men on her father\u2019s construction sites, but didn\u2019t do anything about it out of fear of damaging her job prospects.  While Hillary Clinton should be the person benefiting from this scandal, due to her husband\u2019s past infidelities she can\u2019t be as full-throated as she might like. Trump might have the power to throw Bill\u2019s women in her face now, but once elected \u2013 as seems likely \u2013 she will be in a stronger position to make the empowerment of women, both here and overseas, a central theme of her presidency. Ultimately, then, Trump\u2019s scorched Earth legacy with women may have a positive effect on America.  If the collective moral reaction against Trump means that society is finally ready to say enough is enough, this ugly chapter in our politics could actually turn out to be a victory.",

Sophie was elected leader in July 2015, and in January 2016 was voted to represent the party in the London mayoral election. The views expressed are her own. Hillary Clinton is first woman to become presumptive major-party nominee for U.S. president Sophie Walker: It's not enough to have more female politicians. We need female political leaders at the top This week, I joined a party at the House of Commons to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first petition for women\u2019s votes being delivered to Britain\u2019s Parliament. But in that ancient room \u2013 its richly brocaded walls hung with dark portraits of centuries of male power \u2013 there was another buzz. While we celebrated our hard-fought democratic rights, there were cheers, too, for the right of women to lead the democratic process from the very top. Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic securing of the Democratic presumptive nomination for president is a game-changer. After centuries of glacial progress toward equality for women, Clinton\u2019s race to the White House offers a thrilling political alternative. This might be the point at which we get to see \u2013 finally \u2013 what U.S. politics looks like when women see another woman in a position to change their lives. In politics, it matters to have the people who represent you look like you. It matters to have the people who look like you govern in a way that understands your experiences and can help you fully participate in society and the economy. Despite this, most political decisions are made by men, based on a male understanding of the world. In Britain we set up the Women\u2019s Equality Party because we were frustrated by the dearth of women\u2019s voices in politics. We had had enough of the absence of women at the top of major businesses and the huge numbers forced into low-paid work or unpaid employment as carers. We were sickened by the ever-rising rate of violence against us; the denigration of our lives in the media and the lowering of our daughters\u2019 expectations at school. In short, WE carved out a space in politics from which to challenge the other parties\u2019 assertion that equality for women was not a political priority. Breaking the ultimate glass ceiling What we\u2019re doing, like the huge response to Hillary Clinton\u2019s nomination, has been termed \u201cidentity politics,\u201d a phrase that was coined to express political activity founded in the shared experiences of members of certain social groups. I think it\u2019s very telling that feminist politics is viewed as such rather than just politics \u2013 which should be, but never has been, the shared experience of the whole population. But politicians have always succumbed to group-think when it comes to women, while having little understanding of or relationship with that group. We go from daily being addressed as homogenous humans (based on a male understanding of human) to, at election time, being seen as a special interest collective that will only vote according to which option presents the lowest risk. It\u2019s not enough just to have more female politicians, though that is a vital step toward better representation. We need female political leaders right at the top to create and steer inclusive policymaking. It\u2019s worth noting that during the course of her grueling nomination campaign, Hillary Clinton has struggled to attract young women who refuse to vote \u201cgender first\u201d and working-class women who feel she is too privileged to understand their lives. And certainly, inclusive politics does not always follow when women lead: former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher preferred the company of men in her Cabinet and gave little attention to issues like child care and equal pay, preferring to shore up patriarchal structures. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, when asked in 2013 if she considered herself a feminist, responded she was not, but last year went into a crucial G7 summit on a platform of improving gender equality in the workplace. She has introduced policies around early childhood education, parental leave and better representation of women on boards. Hillary Clinton makes and inherits history Clinton\u2019s manifesto also promises to fight for paid family leave and affordable child care. Other commitments include working to close the pay gap by promoting pay transparency across the economy, supporting women to fight workplace discrimination, defending women\u2019s reproductive rights and confronting violence against women. Promisingly, her campaign adds that \u201cIssues that affect women\u2019s lives are not just \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 \u2013 they are family issues, they are economic issues, and they are crucial to our future competitiveness.\u201d It is no small thing to hear this from someone who may be the next White House resident. The fight for women\u2019s equality has always been a fight to show that women\u2019s rights are human rights, that we are not a special interest group for consideration once important matters of state have been seen to. Inclusive policymaking is one thing; inclusive governing is another. It\u2019s often suggested the reason so few women go into politics is because there are so few women there already to inspire and support them. A President Hillary Clinton would be a huge advance as far as the adage \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be it, to see it\u201d goes; her challenge is to encourage and involve black and ethnic minority women by creating a diverse and intersectional leadership team. The numbers of women in her campaign and advisory circles suggest she would likely appoint women to senior jobs in her administration \u2013 a further encouragement for other women to participate. America\u2019s women won full voting rights in 1920. They have waited nearly a century to be able to vote for a woman president. Let\u2019s hope Hillary Clinton can speed up the history of women\u2019s equality. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs. Democratic candidate in 1968 was defeated in part due to opposition from anti-war members of his own party Jim Bendat and Steve Lubet say they learned that refusing to vote for the lesser of evils candidate was a horrible mistake, with tragic consequences On a warm August night in 1968, the two of us joined thousands of other young people in front of Chicago\u2019s Hilton Hotel, braving tear gas and billy clubs to demand an end to the Vietnam War. While delegates to the Democratic Convention remained sheltered inside, with police and National Guard troops protecting the entrances, we shouted \u201cBring the Troops Home\u201d and \u201cThe Whole World is Watching.\u201d We didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but our most consequential chant was \u201cDump the Hump,\u201d derisively aimed at Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who had until then refused to distance himself from the war policies of President Lyndon Johnson. We wanted to change how the government worked \u2013 and it turned out that we did, although far from the way that we wanted. The Democrats had been fighting among themselves throughout 1968. President Johnson had been poised to run for another term, but Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota announced in late 1967 that he would challenge Johnson on an anti-war platform. Many college students took up McCarthy\u2019s cause, and the challenger nearly won the first primary, in New Hampshire on March 12. Four days later Sen. Robert F. Kennedy of New York, sensing that Johnson was vulnerable, decided to run. Then, suddenly, on March 31, Johnson announced that he was withdrawing from the race. There was little secret to Johnson\u2019s motivation: by dropping out, he would avoid the embarrassment of losing his party\u2019s nomination, and he could join party bosses such as Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley in support of Vice President Humphrey. Who's really winning presidential race? Humphrey didn\u2019t officially announce his candidacy until April 27, conveniently too late to enter any of the nation\u2019s fourteen primaries. (Delegates from the other 36 states were chosen in party conventions that were typically dominated by local political bosses.) Consequently, the big primary elections that spring \u2013 most notably, Indiana, Oregon and California \u2013 were contests between McCarthy and Kennedy. Then came Kennedy\u2019s assassination, on the same night as the California primary, leaving McCarthy as the only anti-war challenger to Humphrey. Bernie Sanders is the future of the Democratic Party That August, the Democratic National Convention took place in Chicago. Humphrey, despite having won zero primaries, easily won the nomination, which seemed as though it had been rigged from the beginning. Young people, and some who were not so young, flooded the streets and parks in protest. The cops responded by cracking heads, in what Connecticut Sen. Abraham Ribicoff called \u201cGestapo tactics.\u201d When Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey squared off in the 1968 election, along with third party candidate George Wallace, the biggest issues were the Vietnam War, civil rights, and anticipated vacancies on the U.S. Supreme Court. As undergrads at Northwestern, neither of us could yet vote in1968 (the voting age was still 21 at the time) but it would not have mattered. Many thousands of Democrats had been alienated by the \u201cpolice riot\u201d at the Chicago convention, and they stayed away from the polls out of \u201cprinciple.\u201d The two of us surely would have done the same. Why Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders should watch 'All the Way' To us, Humphrey, Nixon and Wallace were all pro-war, with no meaningful difference between them. Humphrey\u2019s leadership in the civil rights movement seemed like ancient history, and his association with LBJ was more than enough to condemn him in our eyes. We wanted to change the world, and we thought we had a lot of answers \u2013 none of which involved picking the lesser of evil candidates. We were immature and shortsighted in 1968, rejecting Humphrey even when he belatedly announced his opposition to the war. Nixon was elected by a narrow margin. He escalated the war and invaded Cambodia. He appointed Warren Burger as chief justice of the Supreme Court, as well as William Rehnquist, who would serve on the court for the next 33 years. Nixon\u2019s criminality subverted the 1972 presidential election, for which we are still paying a price in national cynicism. American history would have been dramatically different \u2013 and far better \u2013 if Humphrey had won. Merrick Garland, Obama's Supreme Court pick, gives GOP a headache The president who takes office on January 20, 2017 will most likely have at least one Supreme Court vacancy to fill, and probably more. The rights of today\u2019s children \u2013 to vote, to control their reproductive lives, to have access to health insurance \u2013 will be determined by those justices for decades to come. We have heard the \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d slogans of many Sanders supporters, who threaten never to vote for Clinton in the general election. That would be a horrible mistake. The principled opposition to Hubert Humphrey was deeply misguided in 1968, with monumental consequences for the nation and the world. We can only hope that Sanders and his supporters \u2013 of all ages \u2013 will heed the lesson that we learned so bitterly once Nixon was in the White House.

            "article_content": "Julian Zelizer says the animosity in the debate audience reflects the intense hostility between the two camps He says the candidates and supporters clearly don't like each other, but can they unite against the GOP? If they don't, they could elect a Republican president, he says I was fortunate to have the opportunity to watch Thursday\u2019s Democratic debate in Brooklyn live and in person. Although I have seen the other debates on television, there was something more visceral about being there. What was most dramatic was not any particular point in the debate or any statement the candidates made, but the display of sheer and intense animosity that has developed between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters. With so much attention focused on the civil war taking place among Republicans, commentators may have missed the anger brewing among Democrats. The most exciting Democratic debate The tension was on display to everyone in the room. The candidates themselves barely looked at each other during the commercial breaks or when the contest ended. Besides the tense words they exchanged, their body language made it clear there is now considerable fury at the very top of the campaign about how each has characterized the other and about the kind of politics each represents. Will Sanders' base get behind Clinton? At one moment, CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer implored both of them to stop \u201cscreaming at each other\u201d or else the \u201cviewers won\u2019t be able to hear either of you. \u2026\u201d The tensions on the stage were nothing compared to the tension in the crowd. I sat next to one Sanders supporter who sat with his tattooed arms tightly crossed and head angrily shaking whenever Clinton said anything. In his mind it was clear there was nothing Clinton could do or say that was right. Even when Clinton made a statement about the need to defend women\u2019s reproductive rights, something Sanders strongly supports, he and his friends wouldn\u2019t stand up. Throughout Clinton\u2019s comments, they yelled that she was bought by Wall Street or how she was a liar who refused to answer any question, \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d One of the people in the group said, \u201cI\u2019m a Bernie Democrat. She\u2019s Trump light.\u201d They were not alone. Throughout the room, Sanders supporters made it very clear they disliked Clinton almost as passionately as they dislike the GOP. When Clinton said the party will need to unite when the primaries were over, the man to my left said: \u201cnot for you. We just won\u2019t vote.\u201d His friends agreed. Debate coach: Bad night for Bernie Clinton supporters didn\u2019t feel much better about their opponents. Though not with the same vigor, they yelled when Sanders made statements, saying he was lying about her record or that he would not answer any question with specific statements. In their view, he was an idealist, a demagogue, a candidate who was making promises he could never keep. They yelled at Sanders supporters to sit down when they cheered. At one unpleasant moment, a Clinton supporter sitting behind me mockingly yelled at three of the Sanders backers who were standing up and pumping their fists a slogan used by the Nazis, \u201cSieg Heil.\u201d The nasty comment even led his friend to suggest he calm down. \u201cThat\u2019s offensive,\u201d another Sanders supporter, who had been sitting quietly and calmly throughout the evening, turned to say. Who won Democrats' epic debate in Brooklyn? The tensions are not unique to the debate audience in Brooklyn. A look at the online universe quickly reveals angry vitriol that is flying back and forth between the campaigns. The supporters on each side are reaching the point of demonizing the other, questioning their legitimacy and denying that there is any virtue on the other side. Write something that is slightly positive about either candidate (I have heard it from both sides) and you are instantly subject to a barrage of fury about your words. This is a dangerous state for Democrats. It is logical and expected that passions run high during political campaigns. When primaries are competitive and last for a long time, and when candidates inspire passionate followers, fights tend to break out and feelings are hot. But there does come a time when both sides need to unite or the party will pay the price. In 2008, when the anger between Obama and Clinton supporters ran high, the party was able to move beyond the division and focus their attention on the GOP once Obama received the nomination. Most Clinton supporters joined the party fold, as did the Clintons, and mounted a united front against a danger they deemed much greater to the nation. The Brooklyn Democratic debate in 90 seconds There have been other times, however, when unity didn\u2019t come and the party suffered. Most famous was the political disaster of 1968 when the Democratic party had broken so far apart over issues like Vietnam that party leaders were unable to bring it together. Many supporters of Eugene McCarthy or Robert Kennedy couldn\u2019t stomach supporting Hubert Humphrey, part of an administration that brought the nation and the world the Vietnam War. The result was a Republican president, Richard Nixon. Similar tensions, over different issues, played out in 1980 when supporters of Sen. Ted Kennedy could never find it in their heart to throw themselves behind the re-election of Jimmy Carter, who in their minds had abandoned the Democratic tradition. The most vivid image from the Democratic convention, besides Kennedy\u2019s rousing speech, was when Carter had to literally scramble to find Kennedy on the stage. Carter wanted to hold their hands up in a sign of unity, instead he only could muster a cold handshake. The result was a Republican president, Ronald Reagan. In his memoir, Carter, still bitter about what happened, wrote that the news stories about the incident  \u201cemphasized his lack of enthusiasm as an indication that the split in our ranks had not healed. This accurate impression was quite damaging to our campaign, and was to linger for a long time.\u201d These kinds of tensions don\u2019t have to play out this way, but the candidates can\u2019t take unity for granted. Whoever wins and whoever loses will need to work extraordinarily hard to bridge these two camps. The good news is that polls show at this point in the 2008 campaign there were a greater number of Clinton supporters who said they would never vote for President Obama. Today, 25% of Sanders supporters say they would not support Clinton if she won  the nomination. In May 2008, about half of Clinton backers said they wouldn\u2019t back Obama. Clinton campaign won't release speech transcripts Yet the kind of anger that was evident in Brooklyn suggests the party is closer to a tipping point than it has been at any point in this campaign. If Democrats want to avoid a replay of 1968 or 1980, with a Donald Trump or Ted Cruz winning the White House, they are going to have to lower the temperature in the room and find ways to remind their supporters that the cause of party is more important than the imperative to be right.
