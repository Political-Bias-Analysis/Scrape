Starbucks is going out on a limb with a new concoction featuring oil \u2013 resulting in a slippery sheen that floats to the surface. As the company intended, the bold move has already caused a stir on the internet. But it remains unclear whether the hype will translate to sales, as many consumers are certainly not clamoring for oily drinks.

The Biden administration released a new rule Tuesday that largely bars migrants who traveled through other countries on their way to the US-Mexico border from applying for asylum in the US, marking a departure from decadeslong protocol. The proposed rule, which could affect tens of thousands of people, has garnered wide condemnation from Democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocates alike. Though it is reminiscent of a Trump-era policy, White House officials on Tuesday rejected the comparison to the Trump administration, saying that it\u2019s not a categorical ban on asylum and emphasized efforts to expand access to legal pathways to the US. The rule will likely take effect in May when a pandemic-era border restriction known as Title 42 is set to expire. More than 65 million people in the US are under winter weather alerts today as a massive coast-to-coast storm hits the country with heavy snow and high winds. The alerts extend from as far west as California to Minnesota through Maine, but the Upper Midwest is expected to bear the brunt of the storm in terms of snowfall totals. Minnesota\u2019s Minneapolis area is at the highest risk to pick up at least 15 inches of snow, according to the latest forecasts. The expected conditions today have spurred states to take safety measures as travel conditions continue to deteriorate. More than 500 flights scheduled for today have also been canceled, with Minneapolis and Denver each accounting for more than 100 cancellations, according to FlightAware. A number of Republicans have been making moves suggesting interest in a national presidential campaign and openly considering presidential bids. The primary field is early in its stages, but candidates are beginning to come forward \u2013 and many more are expected in the coming months. The latest GOP hopeful to announce a run for the Republican presidential nomination is entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. He follows Nikki Haley, who\u00a0became the first major rival to challenge former President Donald Trump when she announced her bid last week. Trump announced his third campaign for the White House last year. On the Democratic side, President Joe Biden has yet to officially state his reelection plans, but analysts say an announcement is coming soon. Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, Mexico\u2019s former security minister, was found guilty in federal court Tuesday of taking bribes from the drug cartels he had sworn to combat, the US Attorney\u2019s Office said. The former Secretary of Public Security in Mexico served as his country\u2019s equivalent of the FBI director from 2006 to 2012. Garc\u00eda Luna, who is the highest-ranking current or former Mexican official ever tried in the US, faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum of life behind bars. He will be sentenced in June. Jesus Ramirez Cuevas, a spokesperson for Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, praised the verdict on Twitter: \u201cThe crimes against our people will never be forgotten.\u201d Three climbers were killed in an avalanche while scaling an 8,000-foot peak in Washington state over the weekend, officials announced. A six-person group was attempting to climb a steep gorge on Colchuck Peak in the Cascade Mountains on Sunday when the avalanche happened, the Chelan County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. The three victims ranged in age from 53 to 66 and died after being swept down about 500 feet, according to officials. Their names have yet to be released. More than two dozen personnel have been involved in the rescue effort and local officials are urging people to be aware of the dangerous avalanche conditions before attempting this particular climb. 18-year-old stuns Simon Cowell on \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 Watch the dangerous stunt that left judge Simon Cowell at a loss for words.

President Joe Biden visited the US-Mexico border on Sunday amid record levels of border crossings, but he did not appear to see or meet with migrants, including during a trip to a migrant respite center. The visit to El Paso, Texas, marked Biden\u2019s first to the southern border since he took office and appeared largely focused on enforcement issues and speaking with border enforcement personnel. The president\u2019s flight was also met by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a persistent critic of Biden and his administration\u2019s federal response to migration. The Republican governor confirmed to reporters that he gave Biden a letter outlining what he described as \u201cchaos\u201d on the border. Biden is scheduled to travel to Mexico today, where he will discuss migration issues with the country\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Kevin McCarthy was elected House speaker on Saturday \u2013 a major victory for the California Republican that elevates him to a powerful position leading the GOP majority in the chamber and an outcome that followed days of painstaking negotiations and failed votes. To win over critics, McCarthy and his allies made a series of concessions to hardline conservatives \u2013 a move that frustrated moderates concerned the concessions may make it harder for the new GOP majority to effectively govern. House Republicans are now turning their attention to implementing their agenda, which includes gearing up to investigate the Department of Justice and the FBI. This will set up a showdown with the Biden administration and law enforcement agencies over their criminal probes, particularly those into former President Donald Trump. Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro broke into the country\u2019s congressional building, Supreme Court and presidential palace Sunday. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva described events in the capital Brasilia as \u201cbarbaric\u201d and said \u201ca lack of security\u201d had allowed Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cfascist\u201d supporters to breach barriers set up by the Armed Forces. He also emphasized those responsible \u201cwill be found and punished,\u201d as police made at least 400 arrests, according to CNN Brasil and a local official. The breaches come about a week after the inauguration of Lula da Silva, who defeated Bolsonaro in a runoff election on October 30. Bolsonaro denounced his supporters\u2019 actions Sunday and his office previously said it would cooperate with the transition of power, but he has not explicitly conceded. Several California communities are bracing for another round of likely flooding and power outages today. More than 34 million people were under flood watches across much of California Sunday night, while more than 30 million were under moderate risks for excessive rainfall. About 28 million people across the West were also under wind alerts. In Sacramento County, various evacuation orders have been issued, with officials warning that \u201cflooding is imminent.\u201d El Dorado, Monterey, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara and Alameda counties have issued evacuation warnings or recommendations for some areas due to possible flooding and other safety risks. This storm is arriving on the heels of a powerful cyclone that flooded roads, toppled trees and knocked out power to much of California last week. Prince Harry\u2019s highly anticipated memoir \u201cSpare\u201d will be published late today, setting the stage for an explosive week for the royal family as they navigate his highly publicized disclosures. In two interviews with British and US networks ITV and CBS, the Duke of Sussex spoke of the death of his mother, the former Princess of Wales; his disdain for the British press; his anger over the treatment of his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and the subsequent fallout with his family since their marriage. Speaking to CBS\u2019 60 Minutes on Sunday, he said he hadn\u2019t spoken with his brother, Prince William, and his father, King Charles III, for \u201ca while,\u201d adding the \u201cball is very much in their court\u201d when asked about the possibility of a reconciliation. Buckingham Palace has repeatedly declined to comment on the memoir, which has been the subject of leaks detailing some of his most controversial claims. Nurses from New York City hospitals go on strike About 7,000 nurses in New York City went on strike this morning after contract negotiations at two major hospitals stalled. Tentative deals were reached in recent days covering nurses at seven hospitals, but deals have not yet been reached for Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan or Montefiore in the Bronx. The nurses are seeking increased pay as well as promises by management to increase staffing to address the union\u2019s major complaint of nurses being overworked and facing burnout. The affected hospitals have developed contingency plans, which include transferring some patients and paying temporary \u201ctraveling\u201d nurses to fill in where possible.

            "article_content": "Gabby Beckford\u2019s plan to visit the British Virgin Islands started with a flurry of searches on what to wear, eat and do in between exploring the islands\u2019 pristine beaches and sapphire waters. But instead of using Google or other search engines, she turned to TikTok. \u201cOn TikTok, I can search what restaurants to go to, I can see what people ate and their reaction to the food,\u201d says Beckford, 27, who\u2019s visiting the British territory in the Caribbean this week. \u201cI can see what they\u2019re wearing, what the weather\u2019s like.\u201d Beckford, a travel content creator who splits her time between Seattle and Washington, DC, says TikTok has become a lifeline for her and many other users. She says the short-form video platform is much more than cat videos and posts by \u201cinfluencers.\u201d To her it\u2019s a one-stop shop for a wide range of content, from mental health advice to product reviews, all presented in bite-sized clips that don\u2019t require plowing through blocks of text. \u201cIt\u2019s visual,\u201d she says. \u201cI can tell who posted the content, and whether it\u2019s done with me in mind.\u201d Beckford\u2019s devotion to TikTok illustrates why US lawmakers and others, who view the platform as a security threat because of its parent company\u2019s roots in China, will have a challenge trying to scrub it from Americans\u2019 digital lives. In recent weeks more than a dozen US states and the US House of Representatives have banned TikTok from government devices. One US congressman, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, called it \u201cdigital fentanyl\u201d because of its addictive nature among young users and believes it should be blocked across the United States. Some universities also are restricting access to the app. But with more than 1 billion global users, TikTok may be too entrenched in our culture to be shut down. It was the most-downloaded app in the United States last year, and its users say its platform is much more than teens watching viral dance or cute animal videos. It\u2019s become a critical tool for content creators, small business owners and many others who have made TikTok an integral part of their lives. Avid TikTok users tell CNN they\u2019re not spending sleepless nights worrying about the app\u2019s ties to China and whether it poses security risks. They are more concerned about what they say would be lost in a world without TikTok: business income, entrepreneurial opportunities and a platform \u2013 built around short, creative and informational videos \u2013 where they can express themselves and connect with others. TikTok has exploded in numerous ways since its international debut in 2017. It now hosts videos on almost every topic under the sun. Khamyra Sykes, 16, shares short comedy skits and lifestyle content with her 560,000 TikTok followers. She uses the platform to make money by partnering with clothing brands and doing political ads \u2013 like a get-out-and-vote clip for the recent midterm election. The Atlanta-area resident sometimes cross-posts her TikTok videos on Instagram, where she has 1.5 million followers. Like many other teens, Sykes also watches a lot of TikTok content. Some days, she says she falls asleep to TikTok videos \u2013 anything with cuddly puppies or tasty-looking recipes. Brands consider TikTok key to social media marketing, she says, and many consider the size of creators\u2019 followings and their engagement numbers when signing promotional deals. \u201cIf Tiktok was banned in the US, I would lose out on a large part of my fanbase and also brand deals,\u201d Sykes says. \u201cBanning TikTok will cause a huge job loss for creators who depend solely on TikTok for their livelihood, and will have a devastating impact on small businesses that use it for marketing and sales.\u201d Saman Movassaghi Gonzalez, an immigration attorney in Miramar, Florida, uses TikTok to market her law practice to her 83,000 followers. Her short videos offer a light take on an otherwise heavy subject: In one, an image of her morphs into a fiery superhero who takes flight. \u201cMe on my way to get my client out of immigration deportation/removal proceedings,\u201d the caption reads. \u201cIt\u2019s entertaining and catchy, so it works in getting people\u2019s attention in a short period of time,\u201d Gonzalez tells CNN. Sometimes, she breaks into dances as informative captions with immigration facts scroll on the screen. The 42-year-old says she\u2019s gained some clients though the app, and checks it hourly to stay on top of messages. \u201cIt fits my personality. There are so many options to showcase who you are through the app, whether it\u2019s short clips, skits or dances,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cAnd I love spreading information to people while trying to make it fun and entertaining.\u201d Like Facebook and Instagram before it, TikTok has become deeply embedded in American culture. The platform has created bestsellers and hit songs. Millions turn to it for wellness tips and fashion advice. CNN and other media outlets post news clips on TikTok. Rihanna introduced her new baby to the world on TikTok. Some believe Madonna used TikTok to make a recent statement about her sexuality. TikTok has launched countless careers, dance trends and memes. The app is especially popular with young people. A majority of its users are Gen Z, and a third of them are under 19, says Saif Shahin, an assistant professor of digital culture at Tilburg University in The Netherlands. But \u2013 ask any parent of a teenager \u2013 some adults feel the app consumes too much of young people\u2019s attention. \u201cWhile most social media apps tend to be addictive, none is more so than TikTok,\u201d Shahin says.  \u201cEvery day, users spend an average of an hour and a half on TikTok, which is nearly double the average time spent on Facebook or Instagram.\u201d This popularity, experts say, can be a double-edged sword. For example, public health experts have used TikTok to convey important messages during the coronavirus pandemic. The White House has even hosted TikTok influencers for briefings on the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other pressing topics. But researchers found TikTok\u2019s search engine has spread misinformation about the pandemic, abortion, school shootings and other topics. And while TikTok provides resources on mental health, Shahin says it and other social media platforms can heighten attention deficiency, anxiety and depression. \u201cTikTok has changed some aspects of our lives negatively \u2026 it has shortened our attention span and allows for the proliferation of misinformation,\u201d says Christina Ferraz, founder of Houston-based public relations agency Thirty6five. \u201cIf TikTok were to go away, it would remove one of the free sources of joy, connection and entertainment still available to anyone, anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection,\u201d Ferraz adds. \u201cHowever, it would also remove access to a platform known to create space for bullying and illicit activities for Gen Z.\u201d TikTok has made a number of announcements in recent years in an effort to ease concerns about its content, including adding controls to help parents restrict what their children can see on the app. \u201cTikTok is loved by millions of Americans who use the platform to learn, grow their businesses, and connect with creative content that brings them joy,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson told CNN last month. In response to concerns about national security, TikTok has said the Chinese Communist Party has no control over its platform and that ByteDance is a private company which is owned mostly by global institutional investors \u2013 including Americans. Taccara and Yinka Lawanson, a couple who go by Ling and Lamb on TikTok, have 3.7 million followers on the platform. When they first joined, they referred to it as \u201cthe fast food of social media.\u201d \u201cIt was the app you could go to and feel that you have the creative freedom to be yourself \u2026 goofy, playful with no one judging you,\u201d they said in an email to CNN. \u201cIt was the app that in 60 seconds or less allowed the user the opportunity to go viral and become a star \u2013 which other platforms did not offer at the time.\u201d The thirtysomething Connecticut couple \u2013 she grew up in the US and he\u2019s from Nigeria \u2013 share short musings about daily life, including their cultural differences from growing up on opposite sides of the world. Like all social media platforms, they say, TikTok has its pros and cons. \u201cIt\u2019s up to each individual to decide what apps are positive or negative for the purpose in which they are looking to use the app, or what they are looking to get out of it,\u201d they say. \u201cFor us, we don\u2019t really have negative viewpoints of TikTok, as it has allowed us the opportunity to build and grow a great community of people around the world.\u201d Phillip Calvert, a Milwaukee resident who goes by PhilWaukee on TikTok, downloaded the app when he lived in Shanghai, China, in 2018. He didn\u2019t have much choice \u2013 he says social media platforms such as Instagram were blocked in the country. Now that Calvert has moved back to the United States, he\u2019s glad he got an early introduction to TikTok. \u201cPeople don\u2019t even ask me for my Instagram anymore, they ask me for my TikTok,\u201d he says. Calvert believes the app, with its steady diet of digestible videos, has become Gen Z\u2019s alternative to television. \u201cThe other day, I asked my 15-year-old cousin to watch TV until I return. He told me, \u2018Why would I watch TV when I have TikTok?\u2019 \u201d he says. Calvert, who\u2019s in his 30s, earns income by posting travel videos and other content to TikTok. He says he earned his first TikTok payment from a Black History Month partnership. He\u2019s trying to grow his TikTok following and checks the platform several times a day. \u201cI don\u2019t wake up in the middle of the night to check it, because I\u2019m on it until the middle of the night,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had to give up all social media and keep one, I\u2019d choose TikTok because it\u2019s the newest, and it\u2019s fascinating to see where this is going.\u201d All the content creators CNN spoke to say that losing TikTok would be a major setback for their brands. Calvert is hoping the pushback against his favorite social app will have the opposite effect. \u201cSometimes when you take something and you vilify it, it gets bigger and better,\u201d he says. But the creators also agree that if they\u2019re barred from TikTok, they won\u2019t spend too much time mourning. They\u2019ll move on to the next shiny social platform.",

In fact, depending on where you live, your income tax rate may have already changed. Sales taxes on common items like gas and groceries have also undergone some noteworthy alterations. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The battle for House speaker will resume for a fourth day today. On Thursday, GOP leader Kevin McCarthy continued to suffer a string of defeats in multiple rounds of voting before the House adjourned. As the fight for the gavel drags on, it has now become the longest speaker contest in 164 years. Each failed vote only increases pressure on McCarthy to end the impasse, but it is unclear whether he will be able to lock in the 218 votes he needs to win. Talks are continuing among Republicans after negotiations aimed at winning over McCarthy opponents picked up steam on Thursday. Key House GOP negotiators said they were moving toward an agreement that would bring McCarthy closer to the number of votes he needs. Today marks two years since the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and security officials are preparing for a wave of planned protests in the area. Multiple sources tell CNN that the US Capitol Police will have civil disturbance units on standby for several protests on the Capitol grounds that have already been granted permits and at the Supreme Court building. The increased security measures come out of an abundance of caution, sources tell CNN, and reflect what has become standard protocol for Capitol Police in the wake of the deadly insurrection two years ago. Also today, President Joe Biden is expected to mark the anniversary by awarding the Presidential Citizens Medal to 12 people. The individuals include law enforcement officers who were injured defending the Capitol, a Capitol Police officer who died in the attack, and election workers who rejected efforts by former President Donald Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election. All 32 teams in the NFL are set for their final scheduled regular-season games this weekend, but many players across the league are contemplating an emotional return to the field in the wake of Damar Hamlin\u2019s mid-game cardiac arrest. On Thursday, doctors said the 24-year-old Buffalo Bills player is awake in a Cincinnati hospital, is neurologically sound and is moving his hands and feet \u2013 news that has elicited relief from supporters nationwide after he collapsed on the field Monday. Several players across the league are cheering on Hamlin\u2019s improvement, but many are still understandably shaken up and unsure if they\u2019re ready to play this weekend. On Thursday, the NFL canceled the Bills vs. Bengals game, meaning both teams will head into the playoffs having played one fewer game than other teams in the American Football Conference. League officials are expected to meet today with all NFL teams to discuss a proposal for playoff options amid such unforeseen circumstances. President Biden on Thursday announced he is expanding a program to accept up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela \u2013 along with a plan to expel as many migrants from those countries who circumvent US laws. In a speech at the White House, Biden unveiled plans to visit the US southern border this weekend, stopping in El Paso, Texas, to meet local officials and address border security issues. It will be his first stop at the border as president. Biden will also visit Mexico early next week, where he will discuss migration issues with the country\u2019s president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. The Biden administration is trying to lean on Mexico and other countries in the Western Hemisphere to provide temporary protections to migrants who have fled their home countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine for 36 hours beginning today to allow Orthodox Christians to attend Christmas services. But the proposal was swiftly dismissed as \u201chypocrisy\u201d by Ukrainian officials. During his nightly address Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced skepticism about the temporary ceasefire, saying Moscow is using Orthodox Christmas \u201cas a cover\u201d to pause and resupply equipment and ammunition. The proposal for a temporary truce also raised eyebrows among the international community. President Biden later voiced his skepticism on Putin\u2019s move: \u201cHe was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches on the 25th and New Year\u2019s. I think he\u2019s trying to find some oxygen.\u201d Homeowner spots two-legged fox in her yard \u201cIt was the weirdest thing I\u2019ve seen in my life,\u201d the woman told CNN.

            "article_content": "Mark Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal County, has filed paperwork to run for Senate in Arizona, entering the unpredictable three-way race for the seat currently held by independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. Lamb is the first prominent Republican to formally join the primary, which could escalate further with the entry of Kari Lake, the far-right unsuccessful 2022 Arizona gubernatorial nominee who has also teased a bid. Over the last few years, Lamb has worked to raise his profile with the GOP base, making regular appearances on Fox News, focusing on immigration and criticizing Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Lamb also has a checkered history as a proponent of false claims about election integrity. He supported former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, defended rioters at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and vowed to investigate voter fraud in the 2022 midterms. However, at a congressional hearing earlier this year, Lamb admitted he had seen \u201czero evidence\u201d of fraud that could have impacted the outcome in 2020. Ahead of a potentially crowded and contentious primary, Lamb is viewed favorably by some top Republicans, GOP sources have told CNN. Meanwhile, Abe Hamadeh, formerly the Republican nominee for Arizona attorney general, is also weighing a run. Both Lamb and Hamadeh met recently with National Republican Senatorial Committee officials. Two other Republicans, Jim Lamon and Karrin Taylor Robson \u2013 who ran in 2022 for Senate and governor respectively \u2013 are also considering jumping into the race, sources familiar with the matter say. Trump\u2019s influence looms large. His endorsement of Blake Masters in the 2022 race proved influential, and Lake has been loudly auditioning for his support as she\u2019s traveled the country following her loss in the gubernatorial race. In addition, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego announced in January that he will also challenge Sinema in 2024 after she declared she was leaving the Democratic Party late last year to register as an independent. Gallego\u2019s declaration sets up a three-way race in a battleground state that\u2019s been the epicenter of election controversies in consecutive cycles. The race will also put pressure on national Democrats, who are attempting to retain a two-seat US Senate majority while defending several vulnerable incumbents across the country. Sinema has not yet announced her plans for 2024, but The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that her team is preparing for reelection.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden often envisions what he could accomplish with a second term, advisers and allies who speak with him say, but he has expressed no urgency to formally launch a campaign to win another four years in office. The president has not settled on a campaign manager, narrowed down whether a headquarters would be placed in Philadelphia or Wilmington, Delaware, or selected a date to make a reelection bid official. Long known for stretching out major decisions \u2013 including several times as a senator when he was weighing a run for president \u2013 Biden is offering up one final wait for Democrats as they look ahead to next year\u2019s vote. \u201cIn what I think is the unlikely chance that he ultimately decides not to run this time, he will need to do so soon enough that other candidates can get into the field to be competitive,\u201d said Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, the president\u2019s close friend and ally. \u201cI am encouraging him to run, and I think he will run. But he will make that decision on his timeline, not mine.\u201d CNN Poll: Americans' views of the economy have improved but overwhelming majority still say it's in poor shape The President has been notoriously deliberate over the course of decades in public office, often putting off major decisions until the 11th hour. But holding off on making a reelection announcement is rooted in far more practical considerations, aides say, first and foremost of which is focusing on governing matters such as raising the debt ceiling and avoiding getting drawn into the political fray a moment sooner than he must. \u201cHe\u2019s not ambivalent about serving a second term, but he\u2019s in no rush to be a candidate again,\u201d a longtime Democratic adviser, who has worked closely with Biden over the years, told CNN. \u201cWhat\u2019s the upside?\u201d That question came into sharp view this week, given how former President Donald Trump dominated the conversation and commanded outsize attention with his arraignment on criminal charges in New York. And the Democratic Party has largely coalesced behind Biden, particularly since the midterm elections last fall, and know the lack of a serious primary threat offers him \u201cthe ability to move on his own time,\u201d a senior White House official said. Biden has told several elected officials in private conversations that he\u2019s in \u2013 \u201cI am definitely running,\u201d he told one person a few weeks ago, according to that person \u2013 but he has been less forthcoming on timing. April had for a while been seen as a likely timeline for announcing his candidacy, given that it comes four years after he jumped into the race in 2019. And as vice president, he joined then-President Barack Obama in opening a reelection campaign in April 2011. The timing of a Biden announcement is now more likely to be the summer rather than spring, three Democratic officials say, with a target date still not determined. \u201cPresident Biden has been clear that he intends to run, and his focus is on finishing the work he\u2019s doing for American families: continuing to bring manufacturing back from overseas, further cutting the deficit by having rich special interests pay their fair share, and standing up for fundamental rights like the freedom to choose,\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates told CNN. \u201cThere has never been a timeframe for any announcement.\u201d Outside of interviews, Biden has remained mostly silent about his reelection plans. That made two nods he gave recently to a likely run more notable. During an event handing out national Arts and Humanities medals at the White House last month, Biden said certain people were \u201cready to run\u201d and, noting novelist Colson Whitehead\u2019s two Pulitzer Prizes, said he was \u201ckind of looking for a back-to-back myself.\u201d The allusions were hardly lost on anyone in the East Room, many of whom were ardent supporters of Biden\u2019s last presidential bid and are eager to back a campaign for a second term. For other observers, including some in touch with the president that week, the asides also felt like subtle brushback against those who still question whether he actually plans to run again. Signs of a pending campaign have been hard to miss. Biden has spent the opening months of the year traveling the country to promote the accomplishments of the first half of his term at events that could easily be confused for campaign stops. He has intensified his attacks on Republicans, including taking aim at anti-LGBTQ laws in Florida championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely contender for the GOP nomination. And a string of moves on immigration, crime and energy have bolstered Biden\u2019s image as a moderate while angering some liberals for appearing to back off his prior promises. Taken together, the portrait is of a candidate-in-waiting. Yet Biden has put off making a final decision about running again, and the time frame for a potential announcement \u2013 never set in stone \u2013 appears to be extending further into the year. Last year, senior advisers to Biden discussed launching the reelection campaign early in the new year, and some members of Biden\u2019s family, too, are said to have favored an announcement as early as February. But that once-debated aspirational timeline has come and gone. Now, sources say, a reelection announcement taking place even by the end of April doesn\u2019t appear guaranteed. So far, the stretched-out timeline doesn\u2019t appear to be worrying Democrats, at least outwardly. \u201cI have no doubt President Biden will run again and will win,\u201d said Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democratic congressman who has long been a booster of Biden running, attended his very first fundraiser in April 2019 in Philadelphia on the day he launched and who hosted Biden a few weeks ago in his district for the official release of the budget. \u201cAs far as when he exactly officially announces his reelection campaign, I couldn\u2019t care less. It\u2019s meaningless.\u201d Obama formally launched his reelection campaign in April 2011. George W. Bush filed official papers to run for reelection in May 2003 but didn\u2019t begin actively campaigning until much later. Donald Trump declared his intention to run again the day he entered office in 2017. All of those presidents\u2019 reelection bids were considered givens. While Biden has said from the get-go that he intends to run again, he faces perpetual misgivings over his advanced age and soft approval ratings. In a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS released Thursday, just a third of Americans said Biden deserves to be reelected, with a majority in his own party saying they would like to see someone else as the Democratic nominee for president next year. One person familiar with internal deliberations said a reason there is not a great sense of urgency is because potential Republican presidential candidates, too, have been slow to launch their campaigns. So far, the only major GOP candidates to have formally declared runs have been Trump, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Sources also said Biden feels that as an incumbent president, without any serious primary challengers, he has more time to make a final decision. And some close to Biden suggest there is political upside to waiting. \u201cWhy not just let the Republicans try to out-crazy each other for a little while?\u201d asked one former White House official. As Democrats wait for Biden to officially declare a bid for a second term, some crucial decisions for the party remain in limbo. Among those is the location for the 2024 Democratic National Convention, as well as where a Biden reelection campaign would be headquartered \u2013 both decisions that need final sign-off from the President himself. He is said to personally favor a Wilmington, Delaware, base for his reelection campaign, though there has been active talk of centering it in Philadelphia as well. Inside the White House, deputy chief of staff Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon and senior adviser Anita Dunn \u2013 in consultation with other senior Biden aides \u2013 have been running point on preparations for a reelection campaign. Multiple sources said that names that have emerged for potential senior roles on the campaign include Jenn Ridder, national states director for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign, and Sam Cornale, executive director of the Democratic National Committee. Preston Elliott, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s former campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, director of White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, and Quentin Fulks, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock\u2019s ex-campaign manager, are also said to be up for possible senior jobs. Other names in the mix include Emma Brown, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly\u2019s former campaign manager, Roger Lau, deputy executive director at the DNC, Addisu Demissie, former campaign manager for New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, Mitch Stewart, founding partner of 270 Strategies, and Rob Flaherty, director of digital strategy at the White House. Other top Democratic strategists who have been approached for jobs on the campaign declined to sign on, citing personal or professional reasons. And Biden himself hasn\u2019t engaged deeply on the staffing for the senior levels of his potential campaign \u2013 another sign that an announcement, at least for now, appears to remain in the distance. Many of Biden\u2019s longest-serving and most trusted advisers are expected to remain at the White House for the duration of the campaign, setting up a potentially awkward dynamic for any campaign manager. There is a general expectation that at least one of Biden\u2019s longtime advisers would transfer from the White House to a campaign job, but it remains to be seen whom that would be. Other recently departed White House officials, including former chief of staff Ron Klain and ex-communications director Kate Bedingfield, have also suggested they are prepared to assist the campaign. At the handful of Democratic fundraising events the president has held over the past month, he has made only vague allusions to reelection. \u201cWe have a real choice in this election \u2013 unrelated to me, unrelated to me \u2013 between the Democrats and Republicans and what they stand for and what they\u2019re about,\u201d Biden said in Las Vegas, careful not to run afoul of federal rules barring fundraising before officially declaring his candidacy. Even as those around the president wait for an official 2024 decision, there is an air of inevitability about an eventual announcement. Those close to the White House have pointed to some of Biden\u2019s recent policy decisions that have tacked to the center as sending an important signal that his mind is all but made up. Earlier this year, Biden blindsided many Democratic lawmakers when he announced that he would not veto legislation to block a controversial Washington, DC, crime bill that critics had painted as being weak on crime. The Biden administration has also rolled out a number of tough proposals aimed at curbing the entry of migrants at the US southern border, to the dismay of many Democratic lawmakers and immigration activists. A number of other domestic policy announcements aimed at eliminating so-called \u201cjunk fees\u201d and lowering the price of insulin \u2013 all moves considered to have broad appeal \u2013 have also signaled to Biden allies a pivot to reelection mode. But that air of inevitability is also creating jitters among some Democrats, who worry that an unexpected scenario in which Biden decides not to seek a second term would spell disaster for the party. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no clear backup plan. There\u2019s no one else to get fired up about,\u201d said one Democratic congressman. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you see anybody else lining up in the wings to really to take him on.\u201d Biden himself, along with his wife, have said in interviews they intend to mount another campaign barring unforeseen events. Yet both have given themselves some room to back away. \u201cIt\u2019s Joe\u2019s decision,\u201d the first lady told CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz during a trip to Africa earlier this year. \u201cAnd we support whatever he wants to do. If he\u2019s in, we\u2019re there. If he wants to do something else, we\u2019re there too.\u201d CNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and Jasmine Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Just a third of Americans say President Joe Biden deserves to be reelected, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, as a majority in his party say they would like to see someone else as the Democratic nominee for president next year. The survey fielded throughout the month of March and was completed almost entirely before a Manhattan grand jury voted to indict former President Donald Trump last week. It cannot reflect any shifts in public opinion after news of that vote was revealed. CNN polling released Monday, which was conducted after the vote to indict him, suggested that it had little effect on views of Trump himself. The March poll suggests that just before the indictment, the uptick in views of Biden that had seemed to have been sparked by Democrats outperforming expectations in the 2022 midterms had stalled. The poll finds Biden\u2019s approval rating at 42% overall, with 57% disapproving. In January, 45% approved and 55% disapproved. That shift falls within the poll\u2019s margin of error and is not statistically significant. CNN Poll: Majority of Americans approve of Trump indictment On major issues, Biden\u2019s numbers are also stagnant. His approval ratings for handling immigration (35% approve), the economy (37%) and gun policy (37%) all fall significantly below his overall approval rating. On national security (44% approve) and the US relationship with China (40% approve), his numbers are about the same as his overall approval rating. The only issue on which Biden significantly outperforms his overall standing is environmental policy, and even there, most disapprove (46% approve, 52% disapprove). The poll also finds negative views of Biden persist across several personal attributes, with majorities saying he does not have the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president (67%), does not inspire confidence (65%), is not honest and trustworthy (54%) and does not care about people like them (54%). Americans are more evenly split over whether Biden can work effectively with Congress \u2013 48% say he can, 51% that he cannot. All told, just 32% say that Biden deserves reelection to the presidency, down 5 points since December and about on par with the 33% who said the same about Trump in November 2017. The largest shifts come among younger adults, with just 26% of those younger than 35 saying Biden deserves another term in the new poll, down from 36% in December, and among liberals, shifting from 63% saying he deserved reelection in December to 53% now. Generally speaking, the vast majority of people who approve of a president\u2019s performance also say that president deserves reelection, but the new poll suggests an unusually large group of Biden approvers currently say he does not deserve reelection. In September 2019, 3% of all Americans fell into that category for Trump, and just 5% did in March 2010 during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. For Biden, that number is significantly higher: 11% overall approve of Biden\u2019s handling of the presidency and also say he does not deserve to be reelected. This group differs from stronger Biden backers in key ways: Despite their approval of his overall handling of the presidency, majorities in this group have significant doubts about his stamina for the job (70% say he lacks the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president) and ability to inspire confidence (62% say he does not inspire confidence). This \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d group is also nearly 30 points less likely than others who approve of Biden to say they approve of his handling of the economy. Compared with others who approve of Biden, those who fall into this group are also more likely to be political independents (57% identify as independents, compared with 36% who approve and do want him reelected) and younger (64% are younger than 45 compared with 37% of those who approve and do want the president reelected). They are also significantly less likely to be registered voters (60% say they are registered to vote, compared with 86% among those who approve and do want to see Biden reelected), which could mean that they ultimately sit out the presidential election, and in a close race, Biden would need robust turnout among those who approve of his performance. Among registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents, most (54%) say that they would like to see the Democratic party nominate someone other than Biden in 2024, while 44% say Biden should be the nominee. Despite the stagnation in overall views of the president, that marks an improvement for him. In December, 59% said they would prefer a different candidate, and last summer, that figure stood at 75%. The uptick in support comes largely among college graduates (from 32% wanting Biden to be renominated in December to 45% now) and among independents who lean Democratic (from 22% in December to 36% now). As in other recent CNN polling, few who say they\u2019d like to see someone else head the Democratic ticket have a specific replacement candidate in mind. About 7 in 10 in that group say they just generally want to see someone other than Biden, and no individual candidate is named by more than 5% of those looking for an alternate nominee. Those named by more than 1% include Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 5%, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 4%, Vice President Kamala Harris and former first lady Michelle Obama at 3% each, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 2% each. Democratic-aligned voters split over whether the party would have a better chance of winning in 2024 with Biden at the head of the ticket (49%) or if they\u2019d have a better chance with someone else (49%). Biden\u2019s strongest boosters on this question are Democratic-aligned voters age 65 or older (65% say the party would have a better chance with Biden than someone else), while 61% of those younger than 45 say the party would have a better shot at winning with someone else. Why Trump is still favored for the GOP nomination, despite his indictment The survey also mirrored other national polling conducted before Trump\u2019s indictment in finding an uptick in support for the former president as the GOP nominee (52% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said they thought he ought to be the nominee over another unnamed candidate, up from a low of 38% in December). A sizable share of those seeking a different candidate named Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis when asked if there was someone specific they\u2019d like to see nominated (28% who want to see another candidate lead the ticket named him unprompted). Republican-aligned voters were also split in the pre-indictment poll over whether the party would have a better chance with Trump at the top of the ticket or if someone else would have a better shot at winning. The poll found that Republicans and Republican-leaners were more likely to be looking forward to the 2024 election than were Democrats and Democratic-leaners (54% among Republican-aligned Americans, 26% on the Democratic side). The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS from March 1 through 31 among a random national sample of 1,595 adults initially reached by mail. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups. Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Adapted from \u201cNINE BLACK ROBES: Inside the Supreme Court\u2019s Drive to the Right and Its Historic Consequences,\u201d by Joan Biskupic, published by William Morrow. Some Supreme Court justices thought Donald Trump was setting them up. Two days after the official swearing-in of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in October 2018, the president arranged a televised ceremony at the White House and invited all the justices. Justices had declined to attend similar White House events under previous presidents, resisting the optics that would conflict with separation of powers. This time, they especially worried about being used for political purposes and were concerned that an appearance by the full contingent of sitting justices could look like an endorsement of the president. In the end, their concerns were justified. Most of the justices sat stone-faced, disturbed by what Trump said during the event and by being unwitting participants in a political exercise. Trump had a way of ensnarling the court in politics, fomenting rhetoric of personal destruction and conspiracy, all the while generating challenges to the rule of law. Even today at this historic moment, as the ex-president faces criminal charges in Manhattan, one of Trump\u2019s first responses involved attacking the judge who will preside over his initial proceedings. Trump\u2019s terms of aggrievement and personal affront (\u201cHATES ME\u201d) were familiar. Trump wrote in a social media post Friday on Truth Social: \u201cThe Judge \u2018assigned\u2019 to my Witch Hunt Case, a \u2018Case\u2019 that has NEVER BEEN CHARGED BEFORE, HATES ME. His name is Juan Manuel Marchan, was hand picked by Bragg & the Prosecutors, & is the same person who \u2018railroaded\u2019 my 75 year old former CFO, Allen Weisselberg, to take a \u2018plea\u2019 deal (Plead GUILTY, even if you are not, 90 DAYS, fight us in Court, 10 years (life!) in jail.\u201d During Trump\u2019s term as president, the Supreme Court justices navigated challenges to his administration\u2019s policies, his attempts to block various investigations and, finally, his effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Chief Justice John Roberts presided over Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, in 2020. Trump\u2019s presidency further propelled the judiciary into a new era of polarization, through his actions, plus the forceful influence of his appointees, seen most strikingly in last June\u2019s reversal of nearly a half century of women\u2019s abortion rights. Trump\u2019s choice of Kavanaugh for his second Supreme Court appointment triggered an enormous political fight that had not ended with his Senate confirmation. News networks still buzzed that October with coverage of the Senate hearings, especially Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusation that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her while a teenager and Kavanaugh\u2019s denial. Some of the justices later privately revealed that they found the hearings too painful to watch. The sessions stirred their own anxieties from their time in the witness chair, and even those who found Ford credible shuddered at the public thrashing of Kavanaugh. They knew he was destined to join their ranks and already felt some institutional allegiance. Wary of Trump\u2019s invitation after the contentious hearings, Roberts quietly sought reassurance from the White House counsel\u2019s office that the October 8 ceremonial swearing-in would not be overtly political. A secret deal between Justices John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy on gay rights and what it means today With his fears calmed, Roberts and the associate justices went to the White House for the evening event. As the cameras flashed, they took their front-row seats in the East Room. Jane Roberts sat behind her husband. At her side were the other spouses: Ginni Thomas, Joanna Breyer, Martha-Ann Alito and Louise Gorsuch. Trump immediately highlighted the rare attendance of the full Supreme Court: \u201cJoining us for tonight\u2019s ceremony is every sitting Supreme Court justice.\u201d He announced their names, individually, like blue ribbons he had just won: \u201cChief Justice Roberts. Thank you. Justice Thomas. Thank you. Justice Ginsburg. Thank you. Justice Breyer. Thank you, justice. Justice Alito. Thank you. Justice Sotomayor. Thank you. Justice Kagan. Thank you. And Justice Gorsuch.\u201d The audience applauded. What came next shattered the decorum of a judicial ceremony. \u201cI would like to begin tonight\u2019s proceeding differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOn behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure. Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception. \u201cWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency and due process,\u201d Trump continued. \u201c[In] our country, a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. And with that, I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.\u201d But that was not true. There had been no trial, nor even much of an investigation into Ford\u2019s accusations. But as with so many of Trump\u2019s assertions, the truth did not matter to him or to a certain number of his supporters. Some justices confided later that they were sorry they had gone. Justice Clarence Thomas, however, was conspicuously enthusiastic, applauding heartily after Kavanaugh spoke. A Department of Justice spokeswoman, speaking on Fox News, later described Thomas as \u201cthe life of the party\u201d at the Kavanaugh event. Two years later, when Trump hosted a swearing-in for Justice Amy Coney Barrett immediately after her Senate confirmation, Thomas was the only justice present. Thomas administered the constitutional oath in the televised ceremony; the next day she took the judicial oath at the Supreme Court. That night at the White House when Kavanaugh stepped to the lectern, the new justice began his remarks by singling out Roberts. \u201cI\u2019m honored to serve on a Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice John Roberts,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cChief Justice Roberts is a principled, independent and inspiring leader for the American judiciary. As a country, we are fortunate to have John Roberts as chief justice of the United States.\u201d How Ginsburg's death and Kavanaugh's maneuvering shaped the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade and abortion rights The move showed that the two justices had established an early alliance at the high court. (A few weeks later Roberts would favorably cite Kavanaugh in a speech, for the ideal of judicial neutrality: \u201cAs our newest colleague put it, we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation.\u201d) Roberts and Kavanaugh had been friends, first working together in the Department of Justice during President George H.W. Bush\u2019s tenure (1989-1993). Their social circles overlapped, too, through their membership in a Chevy Chase club and poker games among DC\u2019s legal elite. Trump had already made his feelings about Roberts clear as he vilified those who did not act or rule the way he wanted, such as in June 2012 when the chief justice voted to uphold the Obamacare health insurance law. Then known mainly for his New York real estate ventures and reality TV shows, Trump posted on Twitter after the ruling: \u201cWow, the Supreme Court passed @ObamaCare. I guess @JusticeRoberts wanted to be part of Georgetown society more than anyone knew.\u201d The chief justice resisted speaking out against Trump when he became president. Roberts also sought to avoid decisions that divided 5-4 and reinforced Trump\u2019s partisan ways. The sole time Roberts went public to counter Trump came \u2013 perhaps fittingly \u2013 when Trump railed against a federal judge in a way that struck at the heart of Roberts\u2019 assertions of judicial neutrality. The episode marked an extraordinary clash between the heads of two branches of government. In November 2018, Trump disparaged a US district judge who had ruled against his administration\u2019s policy regarding asylum-seekers at the southern border. \u201cThis was an Obama judge, and I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s not going to happen like this anymore,\u201d Trump said of US District Judge Jon Tigar as he spoke to reporters outside the White House. \u201cWe will win that case in the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d Roberts responded with a rare statement issued by the Supreme Court that began: \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d Why Chief Justice John Roberts spoke out Trump fired back on Twitter immediately: \u201cSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u2018Obama judges,\u2019 and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.\u201d Roberts let Trump have the last word, resisting any further provocation. He never again directly addressed a Trump attack on the judiciary. The intemperate Trump has continually tried to pull judges into the political muck with him. His fixation was evident early. During his presidential campaign in 2016, he tried to disparage US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was then hearing a Trump University fraud case in San Diego, as \u201ca Mexican\u201d judge who was unlikely to give him a fair shake. As Trump intensified his dismissive comments about Curiel and sowed other doubts about his regard for the rule of law, the justices declined to comment on his candidacy, with one exception: Ruth Bader Ginsburg. During an interview in July 2016, Ginsburg, surprised that Trump had become the Republican presidential nominee, told me, \u201cHe is a faker. He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.\u201d Trump fired back, saying she should leave the bench: \u201cHer mind is shot \u2013 resign!\u201d Ginsburg soon afterward expressed regret for her remarks, which were criticized across the ideological divide as improper for a jurist. Once he became president, Trump continued to openly disdain the judiciary. He constantly tweeted about the justices, alternately viewing the Supreme Court as his savior or tormentor. \u201cSee you in the Supreme Court!\u201d he crowed in 2017 when he lost an immigration case before lower court judges. A few years later, when the high court majority turned against his administration on a series of issues, Trump tweeted, \u201cDo you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d The court, led by Roberts with a slim 5-4 conservative majority, did become increasingly skeptical of Trump administration policies. In spring 2019, Roberts pulled back on an initial vote for Trump\u2019s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form. Roberts\u2019 switched vote sealed the 5-4 ruling against the plan that immigrant rights groups feared would diminish Latino completion of the important decennial census questionnaire. RELATED: How John Roberts killed the census citizenship question After the ruling, Trump notably declared he would not give up the fight. \u201cI have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census,\u201d he said in one tweet, following it later with a post that, \u201cWe are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question.\u201d But Trump soon had to retreat. There was no time to write a new justification for the citizenship question and defend it in court. The following year, Roberts quietly brokered strong majorities against Trump as the president was trying to keep his personal tax and other financial records from the Manhattan district attorney and, separately, committees of the US House of Representatives. These two cases represented the most direct separation-of-powers battles with Trump during his presidency. The pair of disputes traced to business activities Trump had engaged in before becoming president. New York prosecutors were seeking nearly a decade\u2019s worth of documents related to possible fraud committed by the Trump Organization and Trump himself, including whether he had, when a candidate, directed \u201chush money\u201d to women who claimed to have had affairs with him. Trump has denied the women\u2019s claims. (This New York financial investigation helped lead to Trump\u2019s current charges.) Separately, committees of the House of Representatives, led by Democrats in 2020, were trying to obtain Trump\u2019s accounting and banking records as they developed ethics legislation to tighten money-laundering prohibitions. Both disputes, Trump v. Vance and Trump v. Mazars, initially produced splintered, narrow votes among the justices as they privately discussed the cases. Over two months, however, Roberts coaxed and compromised behind the scenes for two 7-2 decisions against Trump\u2019s arguments as he tried to keep his records secret. Roberts had wanted to lift the issues beyond Trump and show the kind of court unity the justices were able to attain in past separation-of-powers battles, for example with Richard Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1997. Also lurking in the background was the chief justice\u2019s effort to distance the court from the most polarizing president in modern history. As the turmoil continued, Roberts presided over Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial (and acquittal) in the Senate, which arose from Trump\u2019s 2019 apparent bargaining over military aid to Ukraine and a request to President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Ukrainian activities of Joe Biden, whom Trump faced in the 2020 election. Roberts declined to preside during Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial, in 2021, when Trump had just left office and faced charges related to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The Supreme Court continued to confront Trump post-presidency. In January 2022, the justices rejected Trump\u2019s attempt to block the release of presidential records to a congressional committee investigating the siege of the Capitol. Only Thomas publicly dissented as the majority brushed away Trump\u2019s effort to prevent the National Archives from turning over the documents to a US House select committee. Trump\u2019s East Room celebration for Kavanaugh in 2018, eclipsed by so many conflicts in the nearly five years since, still epitomizes an uneasy chapter of the Roberts Court in the Trump era. As Trump tried to keep the court in his clutches, he only widened the fissures. He is out of office, but his presence looms in the judicial system and his legacy at the Supreme Court endures.",

            "article_content": "Wolf Blitzer will sit down with former Vice President Mike Pence to discuss a judge\u2019s order that he testify in a Trump investigation, his political future, global turmoil and more. Watch the CNN Primetime conversation Thursday, March 30 at 9 p.m. ET. The GOP in 2024 is moving toward a reprise of its most consequential foreign policy debate ever in a presidential primary. Only this time, the results may be reversed. The 1952 GOP presidential nomination fight proved a turning point in the party\u2019s history, when Dwight Eisenhower, a champion of internationalism and alliance with Europe to contain the Soviet Union, defeated Sen. Robert Taft, a skeptic of international alliances who wanted to shift America\u2019s focus from defending Europe toward confronting communist China. A similar divide is opening within the GOP now. In a distant echo of Taft, former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the race\u2019s two front-runners have both declared that defending Ukraine against Russia is not an American \u201cvital interest\u201d and \u201cdistracts\u201d (as DeSantis put it) from the more important challenge of confronting China. Other likely 2024 candidates, such as former Vice President Mike Pence and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, come closer to upholding the Eisenhower position that the US must remain steadfast in protecting Europe against Russian aggression \u2013 and insisting that abandoning Ukraine would embolden China and other potential US adversaries. After Eisenhower\u2019s landmark victory over Taft in 1952, every Republican presidential nominee over the next six decades \u2013 a list that extended from Richard Nixon through Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney \u2013 identified more with the internationalist than isolationist wing of the party. But Trump broke that streak when he won the nomination in 2016 behind a message of brusque economic nationalism and skepticism of international alliances. Now, the GOP appears on track for a 2024 nomination fight which may demonstrate that Trump\u2019s rise has lastingly shifted the party\u2019s balance of power on foreign policy \u2013 and ended the long era of GOP internationalism Eisenhower\u2019s victory began. The fact that DeSantis unveiled his views about Ukraine in a statement to Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a fierce opponent of American engagement with allies, underscored the governor\u2019s determination to court Trump\u2019s base with his provocative remarks. After several days of intense criticism from Republican internationalists, DeSantis retreated last week from his description of the war as a \u201cterritorial dispute\u201d and called Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201ca war criminal,\u201d much harsher language than Trump has ever used. But DeSantis, in his interview with British journalist Piers Morgan for another Fox outlet, also reiterated his skepticism of open-ended US support for Ukraine. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s a sufficient interest for us to escalate more involvement,\u201d the governor said. Even with his qualifying statements last week, DeSantis\u2019 skeptical posture toward Ukraine shows the magnetic pull that Trump has exerted on his party, tugging it away from the Eisenhower tradition. \u201cTrump-ism is the dominant tendency in Republican foreign policy and it\u2019s isolationist, its unilateralist, its amoral,\u201d said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and former director of policy planning at the State Department under George W. Bush. The \u201ctraditional institutional approach to the world [which was] \u2026 the dominant Republican approach since World War II \u2026 has clearly been eclipsed for now,\u201d  said Haass, who also held foreign policy positions in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. Ivo Daalder, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and former US permanent representative to NATO under Barack Obama, agrees. The fact that both 2024 GOP front-runners are expressing a broad skepticism about US engagement abroad, he said, raises the possibility that Republican \u201cinternationalists have not only lost in \u201916 and \u201820\u201d when Trump headed the GOP ticket, \u201cbut have lost the party forever.\u201d The 1952 presidential election, by contrast, was the moment when GOP internationalists seemed to win the party forever. Leading into World War II, the party had been closely split between an internationalist wing determined to counter Adolf Hitler and imperial Japan and an isolationist faction resistant to entanglement in the intensifying confrontation with fascism, especially in Europe. The divide was both ideological and geographic, pitting generally more moderate internationalist East Coast Republicans (many of them tied to Wall Street and international finance) against more conservative isolationist forces centered in the small towns and small businesses of the Midwest and the far West. The Japanese surprise attack that triggered the US entry into World War II ended the political viability of a purely isolationist stance. \u201cAfter Pearl Harbor there was no way to be a strict isolationist and a national political [figure],\u201d said Joyce Mao, an associate professor of history at Middlebury College and author of the book \u201cAsia First,\u201d which recounts the GOP foreign policy debates of that era. After World War II, Republican internationalists joined with Democratic presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman to build the international institutions meant to prevent another global war: the United Nations, the Marshall Plan to economically rebuild Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to militarily defend it from the Soviet Union. Eisenhower, who had organized the Allied invasion of Europe on D-Day in 1944, was firmly in that camp and, in fact, returned to Europe in January 1951 to serve as NATO\u2019s first supreme commander. But Robert Taft led a block of \u201cold guard\u201d congressional Republicans that remained much more skeptical of European commitments. Taft, a senator from Ohio and the son of former Republican president William Howard Taft, had generally opposed American aid to Europe before Pearl Harbor and even after the war he pushed to reduce the Marshall Plan and voted against the creation of NATO. Like many of the Republicans who initially resisted involvement in World War II, Mao noted, Robert Taft in the post-war period tried to separate himself both from that isolationist past and the contemporary priorities of GOP internationalists like Eisenhower by arguing for an \u201cAsia First\u201d foreign policy that would shift resources and emphasis from defending Europe to confronting the Communists who had seized control of China. \u201cEisenhower was viewed by Taft and his colleagues as much too moderate,\u201d Mao said. \u201cHis European focus was deemed by that conservative wing of the party as much too similar to the liberal Democrats. If this was going to be a moment for conservatism to reassert itself not only against liberalism but also against the moderates in the Republican Party, China provided an ideal plank\u201d to do so. All these strains culminated in the landmark battle for the 1952 GOP presidential nomination. Taft, the Republican Senate leader, was a passionate favorite of conservatives. Eisenhower, still in Europe as NATO supreme commander, was in many respects a reluctant candidate. But as Stephen Ambrose showed in his classic biography, Eisenhower felt compelled to run largely from fear that Taft would lead the US out of NATO, while simultaneously risking a catastrophic war in China. (Eisenhower was also deeply disenchanted with Truman\u2019s leadership.) Eisenhower resigned his NATO position, returned to the US, mobilized enough support from the GOP\u2019s internationalist wing to beat Taft at the 1952 Republican convention, and then decisively won the presidency that November. \u201cEisenhower became president precisely because he did not trust this version of isolationism in Taft,\u201d said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who served as a senior adviser for strategic planning on the National Security Council under George W. Bush. Both as a general election candidate and as president, Eisenhower tried to minimize his public conflicts with his party\u2019s \u201cold guard.\u201d But he unmistakably steered the party (and the nation) toward acceptance of American global leadership within a robust international system of alliances. With only modest variation, that became the dominant foreign policy ideology of the GOP for the next 60 years under Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Late in that period, George W. Bush offered a different emphasis by stressing unilateral American action over coordination with allies, but even he emphasized the need for the US to remain engaged with the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty unbroken streak,\u201d said Geoffrey Kabaservice, author of \u201cRule and Ruin,\u201d a history of the struggles between GOP conservatives and moderates. Taft-like isolationism, coupled with nativist opposition to immigration and protectionist opposition to free trade, first resurfaced as a major force in the GOP with the long-shot presidential campaigns of conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan in 1992 and 1996. Two decades later, Trump revived that same triumvirate of isolationism, protectionism and nativism \u2013 what scholars sometimes call \u201cdefensive nationalism\u201d \u2013 in his winning drive for the 2016 GOP nomination. Though some traditional GOP internationalists had hoped that Trump in office might moderate those impulses, as president he barreled down all those roads, repeatedly clashing with traditional allies. Now, DeSantis\u2019 choice to echo Trump in devaluing Ukraine \u2013 following the calls from so many House conservatives to reduce the US commitment there \u2013 is deflating another hope of the GOP\u2019s beleaguered internationalist wing: that Trump\u2019s ascent represented a temporary detour and the party would snap back to its traditional support for international engagement once he left office. \u201cTrump-ism has to be taken seriously,\u201d as a long-term force in GOP thinking about the world, Haass said. The foreign policy center of gravity in the Republican Party, he added, has moved toward \u201ca much more pinched or minimal American relationship with the world, [with] not a lot of interest in contributing to global responses to challenges like climate change or pandemics.\u201d Even before DeSantis qualified his comments in the interview with Morgan, Feaver believed the Florida governor was trying to find a position on Ukraine somewhere between Trump\u2019s undiluted skepticism and the unreserved support of Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. But, Feaver said, by including such inflammatory language as \u201cterritorial dispute\u201d in his initial comments, DeSantis demonstrated the risks of pursuing such a strategy of \u201ctriangulation.\u201d \u201cTriangulation is a risky game because if you get the language off, you may commit yourself in a campaign to a line that makes no sense when you are governing,\u201d Feaver said. \u201cThis is one of the hardest problems for newcomers and challengers when they are campaigning for president. By giving applause lines that work for the narrow segments of ideologically hardened factions that they are trying to win over for the primary, they can lock themselves into policy positions that are not sound when they actually win.\u201d As an example, Feaver said DeSantis\u2019 insistence that the US should shift more attention from countering Russia to containing China \u2013 an argument he repeated with Morgan \u2013 was illogical because \u201cabandoning Ukraine assists China\u2019s most significant ally, Russia.\u201d Haley made a similar case in her recent Wall Street Journal article criticizing DeSantis (though not by name) for his comments to Carlson. \u201cIt\u2019s naive to think we can counter China by ignoring Russia,\u201d Haley wrote. Daalder points out another logical flaw in the updated \u201cAsia First\u201d arguments from DeSantis and Trump. \u201cIf the US were to abandon its allies in Europe \u2026 our allies in Asia are going to ask, \u2018What\u2019s to say they are not going to do the same with regards to China?\u2019\u201d Daalder said. \u201cBy demonstrating your willingness to stand up to Russia you are also strengthening the view that in Asia that when it comes to it that we will be there to help them.\u201d But polls leave no doubt that both prongs of the modern Robert Taft position \u2013 that the US should reduce its commitment to Europe-focused international alliances and harden its resistance to China \u2013 have a substantial base of support in the contemporary Republican coalition. In a Gallup poll released earlier this month, by a lopsided margin of 76% to 12%, Republican voters were more likely to identify China than Russia as the principal US adversary in the world. (More Democrats picked Russia than China.) Polls have also found a steady decline in Republican support for US aid to Ukraine: polls this year by both the Pew Research Center and Quinnipiac University found that the share of GOP voters who believe the US is doing too much now equals the combined percentage who think it is doing too little or the right amount. (Quinnipiac found big majorities of Democrats and independents still believe the US is doing the right amount or not enough.) The latest Chicago Council on Global Affairs annual survey also tracks a broader retreat from the world among GOP voters. In that poll, conducted last November, the share of Republicans who said the US should take an active role in world affairs fell to 55% \u2013 the lowest the survey has ever recorded. Underscoring that erosion, a slight majority of Republicans in the poll said the costs of an active US international role now exceed the benefits. Opinions in the GOP about whether the US should do more or less in Ukraine don\u2019t vary much along lines of education or age, the Pew poll found. But generally, these surveys show that the turn away from global leadership is most powerful among two distinct groups of Republicans: those who are younger, and those who lack college degrees. While a solid three-fifths of Republicans with a college degree in the Chicago Council poll said the benefits of US leadership exceed the costs, for instance, a majority of non-college Republicans disagreed. Younger Republicans were also much more likely than those over 60 to say the costs exceed the benefits. It\u2019s probably no coincidence that those two groups \u2013 Republicans without a college degree and those who are younger \u2013 have consistently registered as Trump\u2019s strongest supporters in early polls about the 2024 race. Trump is signaling that in a second term he will likely push even further in an isolationist and protectionist direction. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, has said he believed the former president came close to withdrawing the US from NATO and would likely do so if elected to a second term. Trump certainly hinted at that possibility in a recent campaign video in which he declared, \u201cwe have to finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally reevaluating NATO\u2019s purpose and NATO\u2019s mission.\u201d Trump has also said he would impose a four-year plan \u201cto phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods, everything from electronics to steel to pharmaceuticals.\u201d That would be a wrenching change in the global economy. In all these ways, Trump is promising to fulfill Robert Taft\u2019s vision from seven decades ago \u2013 and to erase Eisenhower\u2019s lasting victory in setting the GOP\u2019s direction. DeSantis does not appear to have decided to jump entirely on that Trump train \u2013 but neither is he lying down on the tracks to stop it. With these two men far ahead of any potential rival, it seems highly likely that the GOP in 2024 will continue to move away from Eisenhower-style international cooperation toward a volatile compound of isolationism and unilateralism. And that could generate enormous turbulence across the globe. Trump\u2019s first term, as Daalder noted, was a chaotic time for the international order and traditional US alliances. But \u201cIf an isolationist leader gets elected president in 2024,\u201d Daalder added, \u201cyou haven\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President and current presidential candidate Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Saturday with a rally speech in Waco, Texas, that was littered with false claims \u2013 many of which he has made before. Trump also delivered unsubstantiated attacks on the integrity of the  criminal investigations into his conduct in various matters, including the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s probe of hush money payments to an adult film performer. Trump alleged deliberate \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d without providing evidence for the charge. Here is a fact check of some of Trump\u2019s other claims in the speech. Trump claimed that he actually won the 2020 election but it was \u201crigged.\u201d \u201cWe won in 2016. We won by much more in 2020 but it was rigged,\u201d he said. Later he reiterated the claim, saying \u201cIt\u2019s a rigged system. Like we had a rigged election.\u201d Facts First: This is one of Trump\u2019s regular lies. He lost the 2020 election, fair and square. Democrat Joe Biden won a 306-232 victory in the Electoral College \u2013 earning over seven million more votes than Trump, good for a margin of 51.3% to 46.8%. Trump went on to repeat a version of a false claim that he made more than 100 times as president \u2013 that the US used to have a trade deficit with China of more than $500 billion. On Saturday he claimed that before he took office, \u201cChina was ripping us off, making $600 billion a year.\u201d Facts First: The US has never had a $600 billion trade deficit with China, even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US runs a surplus with China. The pre-Trump record for a goods deficit with China was about $367 billion in 2015. The goods deficit hit a new record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years. Trump repeated his familiar claim that no president prior to himself had generated revenue from tariffs on China. He said, \u201cWe put massive tariffs, we took hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars out of China. No other president took anything out of China \u2013 not 10 cents.\u201d Facts First: As we have written repeatedly, it\u2019s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an \u201caverage of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\u201d Also, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments \u2013 and study after study during Trump\u2019s presidency found that Americans were bearing most of the cost of the tariffs. During the 2020 election, one of Trump\u2019s campaign slogans was \u201cpromises made, promises kept.\u201d Now that he\u2019s running again, he\u2019s reiterating what he claims were campaign promises he delivered. On Saturday, he referenced the border wall construction that occurred under his administration. \u201cI built hundreds of miles of wall and completed that task, totally as promised,\u201d he said. Facts First: It\u2019s not even close to true that Trump \u201ccompleted\u201d the border wall. According to an official \u201cBorder Wall Status\u201d report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump \u2013 but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not been completed. The report, provided to CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were \u201cin the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,\u201d and that 206 miles were \u201ccurrently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.\u201d Trump claimed, \u201cWe are a nation that has the highest inflation in 50 years.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s \u201c50 years\u201d claim is an exaggeration, though the inflation rate does remain high by historical standards. Last June, the year-over-year inflation rate hit its highest level since late 1981, 9.1%. But about 41 years does not round to \u201c50 years\u201d; the actual highest year-over-year inflation rate for the last 50 years is 14.8% (in early 1980), far higher than mid-2022 levels. More importantly, year-over-year inflation has now declined for eight straight months, hitting 6% in February 2023 \u2013 not even close to the 50-year high. Trump told his familiar story about how, until he was president, the US was unable to deport \u201creally bad people,\u201d including MS-13 gang members to other countries including Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras because those countries \u201cwouldn\u2019t take \u2018em.\u201d \u201cThe buses taking really bad people back into Honduras and El Salvador, Guatemala and other countries, they wouldn\u2019t allow us to go. So, I said to them, \u2018Well, how are we going to get them out?\u2019 They said, \u2018Well, sir, we can\u2019t get them out. We gave up years ago, under the Obama administration \u2018cause they won\u2019t take \u2018em back,\u2019\u201d Trump said. Facts First: It\u2019s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador wouldn\u2019t take back migrants being deported from the US during Obama\u2019s administration, though there were some individual exceptions. In 2016, just prior to Trump\u2019s presidency, none of these three countries were on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered \u201crecalcitrant,\u201d or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals. For the 2016 fiscal year, Obama\u2019s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported that Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here. Trump repeated a claim that, upon the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, it left behind \u201c$85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the \u201c$85 billion\u201d is a rounded-up figure (it\u2019s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment. Trump repeated his claim that while he provided lethal assistance to Ukraine, the Obama administration merely gave Ukraine \u201cpillows and sheets.\u201d Facts First: This is inaccurate. While it\u2019s true that the Obama administration declined to provide weapons to Ukraine, it provided more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 that involved far more than pillows and sheets. The aid included counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, armored Humvees, tactical drones, night vision devices and medical supplies. While talking about why he is running for president again, Trump delivered a mocking aside about the unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign of billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg. He said, \u201cI mean, Mike Bloomberg spent $2.5 billion, he never got past the first (debate) question.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s $2.5 billion figure was a major exaggeration. Bloomberg spent just over $1 billion on his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. That\u2019s a remarkable sum for a campaign that did not last even four months, but it\u2019s far less than $2.5 billion. Criticizing the accusation that he is \u201csoft\u201d on Russia, Trump claimed, \u201cI ended Nord Stream 2. The pipeline was done.\u201d Facts First: Trump did not \u201cend\u201d the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. While he did approve sanctions on companies working on the project designed to carry natural gas from Russia to Germany, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around an estimated 90% complete \u2013 and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump\u2019s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine early last year. The pipeline was damaged later in the year in what has been described as an act of sabotage. Trump also claimed that before he fought against the pipeline, \u201cnobody in this audience, nobody in Washington, ever heard of Nord Stream 2.\u201d Facts First: We can\u2019t speak about the pipeline knowledge of the people in this Waco audience, but Trump\u2019s claim that nobody in the nation\u2019s capital had heard of Nord Stream 2 before Trump came along is false. Nord Stream 2 was a regular subject of media, government and diplomatic discussion in Washington before Trump took office. In fact, Biden publicly criticized the pipeline as vice president in 2016. Trump reprised a story he told during his presidency about how he supposedly managed to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem for less than $1 million. He said, \u201cI promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem and I got it built\u2026for a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the time. It was supposed to cost $2 billion, I got it built for $500,000.\u201d Facts First: The State Department awarded a $21.2 million contract in 2018 for a company to design and build \u201ccompound security upgrades\u201d related to Trump\u2019s decision to turn an existing US diplomatic facility in Jerusalem into an embassy. While the initial modification that allowed the building to open as an embassy cost just under $400,000, that was not the final total as Trump has repeatedly claimed or strongly suggested. This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republicans hold a dour outlook on the country and prioritize finding a 2024 nominee who shares their views on major issues over one with a strong chance to defeat President Joe Biden, according to a new CNN poll of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents conducted by SSRS. The survey suggests sharp divisions within the potential GOP electorate by age, education, ideology and geography, as well as between Donald Trump backers locked into their choice and a more movable group in search of an alternative. Just 30% of all Republicans and Republican-leaners say the country\u2019s best days are still ahead of it \u2013 a dramatic shift from 2019, when Trump held the White House and 77% were optimistic that the best was ahead, and lower even than the 43% who said the same in the summer of 2016, prior to Trump\u2019s election. Most Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (61%) say that the country\u2019s increasing racial, ethnic and national diversity is enriching American culture, but a sizable and growing share see it as a threat. The 38% who consider those changes a threat now is about twice as high as four years ago, and similar to where the party stood in 2016. Meanwhile, a broad 78% majority of Republican-aligned Americans say that society\u2019s values on sexual orientation and gender identity are changing for the worse. And 79% say the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses, just a touch below the share who felt that way at the height of the Tea Party movement during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Looking ahead to the looming primary campaign, the survey finds that most Republicans and Republican-leaning independents would choose a candidate who agrees with their views on major issues (59%) over one who has a strong chance to beat Biden (41%). A broad majority see it as essential that the party\u2019s nominee demonstrate the sharpness and stamina to serve effectively in office (87%), while smaller majorities say it is essential for the nominee to pledge to maintain Social Security and Medicare as they are (59%), represent the future of the party (57%), support government action to oppose \u201cwoke\u201d values (54%) and attract support from outside the party (54%). Asked to name the issue they consider most important in determining who they might support for the nomination, 32% in the potential GOP electorate mention the economy, 16% immigration, and 13% cite specific qualities they\u2019d like to see in a candidate. Fewer name foreign policy (9%), government\u2019s size or spending (7%), or issues related to values, morals and rights (7%). When the potential electorate \u2013 broadly defined as those who say they might participate in the 2024 GOP nomination process \u2013 are asked to choose who they would most likely support from a list of nine potential candidates, two familiar names rise to the top: 40% say they would most likely back Trump and 36% Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. No other candidate reaches double digits, with former Vice President Mike Pence and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley at 6% each. Combining first and second choice candidates, 65% name DeSantis as their top or second choice, 59% Trump, 22% Pence, 15% Haley and 9% former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with the rest of the field at 5% or less. Although primaries and caucuses remain far in the future, about 6 in 10 of those who say they might participate in the nominating process and have a first-choice candidate say they will definitely support that choice. Trump\u2019s backers are most solidly locked in (76% say they\u2019ll definitely support him) and are the most enthusiastic about participating in the primaries (51% are extremely or very enthusiastic). A smaller majority of DeSantis\u2019 supporters say they will definitely support him (59%). The roughly one-quarter of the party who supports a candidate besides Trump or DeSantis is much more open to change. About 7 in 10 in that group say they could change their minds about whom to support (71% say so). All told, though, 7 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they would like the candidates to pledge their support to the eventual nominee regardless of who it is, while only 30% say they should not make that pledge. Here\u2019s a look at some of the key demographic, political and socioeconomic dividing lines within the party. Republicans and Republican-leaners who\u2019ve graduated college are 6 percentage points likelier than those without degrees to say that the government is trying to do too many things (83% to 77%, respectively), 9 points likelier to say America\u2019s best days are ahead (36% to 27%), and 12 points likelier to say that America\u2019s increasing diversity is enriching the country\u2019s culture (69% to 57%). Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who haven\u2019t graduated from college are more likely than the party as a whole to say it\u2019s essential the GOP presidential nominee pledges to maintain Social Security and Medicare (67% feel this way), as are those making under $100,000 annually (64%). Republicans and Republican-leaning independents with college degrees and household incomes above $100,000 particularly stand out as a bloc. They\u2019re significantly more likely than those in any other combination of educational and income categories to think that America\u2019s best days lie ahead (41%), to find increased racial diversity enriching (74%), and to say they believe Trump has had a bad effect on the GOP (45%). They\u2019re also the least likely to say it\u2019s essential that the Republican nominee pledges to maintain Social Security and Medicare (40%), and just 20% call Trump their current first-choice candidate. Echoing a pattern seen in other early polls, those with college degrees are about twice as likely to pick DeSantis as their first choice for the nomination as they are to pick Trump, 41% to 23%, with another 12% picking Haley. Among those without college degrees, 48% currently back Trump, 34% support DeSantis, and just 3% pick Haley as their top choice. Those within the GOP who hold the most conservative views \u2013 describing themselves as \u201cvery conservative\u201d \u2013 are most likely to have a negative impression of the ways in which America is changing today. Nearly 8 in 10 (77%) say America\u2019s best days are in the past, compared with about two-thirds of those who are less conservative, moderate or liberal. They also express the least support for government action to solve the country\u2019s problems, with a near-universal 88% saying the government is doing too many things better left to individuals and businesses. That deeply conservative segment of the Republican Party also appears most engaged in the 2024 nomination contest at this early stage. A little over 6 in 10 very conservative Republicans and Republican-leaners (61%) say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about participating in the primary or caucus where they live, compared with 37% of those who call themselves somewhat conservative, and just 22% of those who are moderate or liberal. The most conservative members of the potential Republican electorate also have a different set of issue and candidate criteria than those with less conservative ideological leans. Asked to name the most important issue in choosing a GOP presidential nominee, about as many who call themselves very conservative chose immigration (23%) as an economic issue (22%). Values or rights related issues came out on top for 13% in this group, compared with 5% or less among those who are somewhat conservative, moderate or liberal. Republicans and Republican-leaners who call themselves very conservative are also near universal in their belief that Biden was not legitimately elected president in 2020, with 84% saying his election was not legitimate, including 56% who say that there is solid evidence of that. There is no evidence that the results of the 2020 election were compromised or that widespread fraud occurred that could have affected the outcome. Independents who lean toward the party align with Republicans more broadly on whether government is overstepping and trying to do too many things better left to individuals and businesses (81% independents, 78% GOP). But, like those with less sharply conservative ideological views, independents who lean toward the party are less engaged in the GOP\u2019s nomination process: 18% say they don\u2019t plan to participate in the nominating process \u2013 about triple the share of Republican-identifiers who say the same \u2013 and just 21% are extremely or very enthusiastic about participating, which is about half the share of Republicans who feel that way (42%). Independents are more apt than partisans, though, to say they\u2019d like to see a candidate who shares their views on the issues than one who can defeat Biden (65% vs. 57%), and they are more likely to say it is essential that the Republican nominee can attract support from outside the party (62% to 52% among partisans). While Republicans generally say that Trump has had a good effect on the party (62% say so, while 25% say he\u2019s had a bad effect), independents who lean Republican are more closely divided, with 47% saying the former president has had a positive effect and 38% a bad one; the rest say he hasn\u2019t made much difference (15%). Within the Republican Party, geography and demography both play a role in outlook on the nation. Republicans and Republican-leaners who live in rural areas are most likely to say the nation\u2019s best days are behind it (78%, compared with 69% in the suburbs and 63% in urban areas), and residents of the Northeast (44% best days ahead) are most likely to see the best days in the future. There\u2019s a stark division by age in impressions of how the changing racial and ethnic makeup of the country is impacting American culture, with 72% of Republicans and Republican-leaners under age 30 seeing increased diversity as an enrichment compared with 47% of those age 65 or older. There is also a sharp split by race: While 41% of White Republicans and Republican-leaning independents see these changes as a threat, 26% of Republicans of color agree. On 2024, suburban Republicans and Republican-leaners express the least enthusiasm about a potential Trump nomination: 55% of rural residents would be enthusiastic if the former president won the nomination as would 45% of urban residents, but just 38% of suburbanites say the same. Older Republicans and Republican-leaners are most likely to say they prioritize nominating a candidate with a strong chance of beating Biden (52% who are 65 or older say so), while 6 in 10 or more in younger groups prioritize a candidate who shares their positions on major issues. Younger Republicans and Republican-leaners are less likely to consider it an essential priority for the nominee to support government action to oppose \u201cwoke\u201d values in American society: Just 40% of those younger than 30 call that position essential compared with 63% of those 65 or older. And pledging to maintain Social Security and Medicare as they are is a sky-high priority for older Republicans, with 81% of those age 65 or older saying it\u2019s essential for the nominee to commit to that. But among those younger than 45, just 45% feel the same way. This CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from March 8-12 among a random national sample of 1,045 self-identified Republicans and Republican-leaning independents drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 points, it is larger for subgroups.",

            "article_content": "In the coming weeks, Gov. Ron DeSantis is poised to show Floridians \u2013 and the country \u2013 just how much further he is willing to go than any other Republican leader to turn his state into a conservative vision where abortion is nearly outlawed, guns can be carried in public without training, private schools are subsidized with taxpayer dollars and \u201cwokeness\u201d is excised. DeSantis\u2019 agenda is expected to dominate the debate in Tallahassee when state lawmakers return to action on Tuesday for what is perhaps the most anticipated legislative session in recent memory. With a decision on his presidential ambitions waiting on the other side of the 60-day session, DeSantis has hyped the humdrum of parliamentary proceedings and legislative sausage-making into a spectacle worth following. \u201cPeople look at Florida like, \u2018Man, the governor has gotten a lot done,\u2019\u201d DeSantis told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d last month. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet.\u201d With DeSantis\u2019 backing or urging, Republican lawmakers have filed a slate of bills that will keep Florida at the forefront of the culture wars that are raging in statehouses across the country. There are legislative proposals targeting drag shows, treatments for transgender children, diversity and equity programs at public universities, gender studies majors, professor tenure, teachers unions, libel protections for the media, so-called \u201cwoke\u201d banking and in-state college tuition for undocumented residents. Other proposals would extend DeSantis\u2019 powers as governor, including to control the hiring of professors on every public campus through his political appointees and put him in charge of picking the board that oversees scholastic athletics in the state. Another would amend a longstanding \u201cresign to run\u201d law so DeSantis could launch a bid for president without stepping down as Florida governor. Though no governor in Florida\u2019s modern history has wielded executive power or the bully pulpit quite like DeSantis, it\u2019s the closely aligned, Republican-held legislature that has handed the governor many of the policy wins that have fueled his political rise. Already this year, the legislature has met in special session to shore up several of DeSantis\u2019 priorities, including the freedom to transport migrants from anywhere in the country to Democratic jurisdictions and fewer hurdles for his new election crime office to charge people for voting errors and violations. Lawmakers in the special session also approved DeSantis\u2019 plans for a takeover of Disney\u2019s special government powers \u2013 punishment for the entertainment giant\u2019s objection last year to the Parental Rights in Education law, dubbed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill by critics, which prohibited the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity until after third grade. Under the new law, DeSantis chooses the board members that oversee the taxing district around Disney\u2019s Orlando-area theme parks. Last week, he appointed to the board a political donor, the wife of the state GOP chairman and a former pastor who once suggested tap water could turn people gay. Now, lawmakers have proposed taking up the legislation at the heart of that feud once again, by extending the prohibited topics in the Parental Rights in Education law to eighth grade. The bill also declares \u201cit is false to ascribe to a person a pronoun that does not correspond to such person\u2019s sex\u201d and it prohibits school districts from requiring teachers or other employees to use a student\u2019s preferred name or pronouns. For his part, DeSantis will deliver the state of the state address on Tuesday and then spend much of the following weeks on the road to promote his new book, \u201cThe Courage to be Free,\u201d a memoir transfixed on the political battles from his first term. It will be up to Republican lawmakers to give DeSantis fresh material from which he can build a narrative for a presidential campaign, should he choose to run. DeSantis has said he intends to decide after the session if he will jump into the 2024 contest. Privately, DeSantis\u2019 political team believes that as a sitting governor, DeSantis\u2019 ability to stack policy wins is critical to mounting a campaign against former President Donald Trump. Like Trump and former Gov. Nikki Haley, the only other major declared candidate, many potential contenders for the nomination are out of office and unable to dictate an agenda for other Republicans to match. And, unlike DeSantis, their records may not reflect what animates GOP primary voters at the moment. In a speech behind closed doors last week to the conservative Club for Growth, DeSantis also suggested he is a singular force among elected Republicans in pushing the party to engage in ideological battles. \u201cI\u2019m going on offense,\u201d DeSantis said, according to audio of his speech obtained by CNN. \u201cSome of these Republicans, they just sit back like potted plants, and they let the media define the terms of the debate. They let the left define the terms of debate. They take all this incoming, because they\u2019re not making anything happen. And I said, \u2018That\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201d Democrats, a perennial minority in Tallahassee with even fewer members after the last election, have little recourse to stop DeSantis and Republican lawmakers. Democrats have asserted that the Republican agenda is failing to address the problems many Floridians are facing, including skyrocketing rents, a housing shortage and fast-rising property insurance rates. \u201cJust a reminder, eggs are still $5 for a dozen,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s $3.50 for a gallon of gas. If you live in the state of Florida in a high rise, you still have to buy flood insurance. But the Republicans want to fight about drag and which bathroom people use.\u201d Still, there are signs of dissent among Republicans in how hard to push on several fronts. Some Republicans have raised concern at the price tag for a DeSantis-backed expansion of a school voucher program that currently allows low-income parents to offset the cost of sending their children to private and religious school. Under the latest proposal, the program would be open to virtually all parents regardless of income, including those who choose to home school their kids. At a committee meeting last week, state Sen. Erin Grall, a Republican, warned that the \u201cpotential for abuse rises significantly with the dollar amount and keeping a child at home.\u201d Republicans also have not settled on a new legislative framework for the future of abortion access in the state. Before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, DeSantis signed a bill to ban abortion at 15 weeks without exception. He recently signaled he would support legislation that banned abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected; however, he has not publicly advocated for it with the same fervor as his other priorities. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s Senate President Kathleen Passidomo previously said she wanted a 12-week ban that included exemptions for rape and incest. John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, an influential conservative group, said he expects a compromise heartbeat bill will pass that includes some exceptions. Other anti-abortion groups want to see DeSantis sign a complete ban on abortion. \u201cWhile exceptions are important and represent real human beings, the bottom line is they are small in number, so it\u2019s a huge victory even with exceptions and I think the governor and his staff are thinking the same way,\u201d Stemberger said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly committed to signing a heartbeat bill.\u201d It remains to be seen, too, how Republicans respond to DeSantis\u2019 immigration agenda. DeSantis has proposed repealing a measure that granted in-state tuition for undocumented students who were brought to the US by their parents. The law, championed by his own lieutenant governor, Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez, when she was a state representative, was a top priority of his predecessor, then-Gov. Rick Scott, and passed the GOP-controlled legislature with help from many of the party\u2019s Latino members. Additionally, DeSantis wants lawmakers to mandate that employers check the immigration status of all workers against a federal database called E-Verify, a proposal opposed for years by the state\u2019s influential hospitality and agriculture industries that bankroll many Republican campaigns. Republicans have also faced pressure from the right on another DeSantis priority: eliminating the state permit to carry a concealed weapon in Florida. Under the proposal, eligible Floridians could carry a concealed gun in Florida without seeking approval from the state, which currently requires proof of training and a background check to obtain. While Democrats and gun-control advocates have criticized DeSantis for removing one of the few checks on firearms in the state, gun-rights activists have said the measure doesn\u2019t go far enough. They want Florida to allow people to carry a gun in public in the open and for the state to eliminate gun-free zones. In Florida, it\u2019s currently illegal to carry a firearm at a school or on a college campus. \u201cThe title of \u2018constitutional carry\u2019 for this bill is a lie,\u201d Luis Valdes, the Florida director of Gun Owners of America, said during a recent committee hearing on the bill. \u201cWhy are Republicans defending (former Democratic attorney general) Janet Reno\u2019s gun control policies?\u201d DeSantis has suggested, at times, that it is up to the legislature to put these bills on his desk. But for some conservatives, DeSantis has set the expectation that he can bully Republican lawmakers into supporting any measure he gets behind. DeSantis himself has said his political philosophy is guided by taking political risks that others won\u2019t. \u201cBoldness is something that voters reward,\u201d DeSantis said Sunday in California. \u201cThe lesson is swing for the fences. You will be rewarded.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Conservative Political Action Conference is underway in Maryland. And the members of Congress, former government officials and conservative personalities who spoke at the conference on Thursday and Friday made false claims about a variety of topics. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio uttered two false claims about President Joe Biden. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia repeated a debunked claim about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama used two inaccurate statistics as he lamented the state of the country. Former Trump White House official Steve Bannon repeated his regular lie about the 2020 election having been stolen from Trump, this time baselesly blaming Fox for Trump\u2019s defeat. Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida incorrectly said a former Obama administration official had encouraged people to harass Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina inaccurately claimed Biden had laughed at a grieving mother and inaccurately insinuated that the FBI tipped off the media to its search of former President Donald Trump\u2019s Florida residence. Two other speakers, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and former Trump administration official Sebastian Gorka, inflated the number of deaths from fentanyl. And that\u2019s not all. Here is a fact check of 13 false claims from the conference, which continues on Saturday. Marjorie Taylor Greene said the Republican Party has a duty to protect children. Listing supposed threats to children, she said, \u201cNow whether it\u2019s like Zelensky saying he wants our sons and daughters to go die in Ukraine\u2026\u201d Later in her speech, she said, \u201cI will look at a camera and directly tell Zelensky: you\u2019d better leave your hands off of our sons and daughters, because they\u2019re not dying over there.\u201d Facts First: Greene\u2019s claim is false. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky didn\u2019t say he wants American sons and daughters to fight or die for Ukraine. The false claim, which was debunked by CNN and others earlier in the week, is based on a viral video that clipped Zelensky\u2019s comments out of context. In reality, Zelensky predicted at a press conference in late February that if Ukraine loses the war against Russia because it does not receive sufficient support from elsewhere, Russia will proceed to enter North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries in the Baltics (a region made up of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that the US will be obligated to send troops to defend. Under the treaty that governs NATO, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and Zelensky didn\u2019t say Americans should fight there. Greene is one of the people who shared the out-of-context video on Twitter this week. You can read a full fact-check, with Zelensky\u2019s complete quote, here. Right-wing commentator and former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon criticized right-wing cable channel Fox at length for, he argued, being insufficiently supportive of Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. Among other things, Bannon claimed that, on the night of the election in November 2020, \u201cFox News illegitimately called it for the opposition and not Donald J. Trump, of which our nation has never recovered.\u201d Later, he said Trump is running again after \u201chaving it stolen, in broad daylight, of which they [Fox] participate in.\u201d Facts First: This is nonsense. On election night in 2020, Fox accurately projected that Biden had won the state of Arizona. This projection did not change the outcome of the election; all of the votes are counted regardless of what media outlets have projected, and the counting showed that Biden won Arizona, and the election, fair and square. The 2020 election was not \u201cstolen\u201d from Trump. Fox, like other major media outlets, did not project that Biden had won the presidency until four days later. Fox personalities went on to repeatedly promote lies that the election was stolen from Trump \u2013 even as they privately dismissed and mocked these false claims, according to court filings from a voting technology company that is suing Fox for defamation. Rep. Jim Jordan claimed that Biden, \u201con day one,\u201d made \u201cthree key changes\u201d to immigration policy. Jordan said one of those changes was this: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to deport anyone who come.\u201d He proceeded to argue that people knowing \u201cwe\u2019re not going to get deported\u201d was a reason they decided to migrate to the US under Biden. Facts First: Jordan inaccurately described the 100-day deportation pause that Biden attempted to impose immediately after he took office on January 20, 2021. The policy did not say the US wouldn\u2019t deport \u201canyone who comes.\u201d It explicitly did not apply to anyone who arrived in the country after the end of October 2020, meaning people who arrived under the Biden administration or in the last months of the Trump administration could still be deported. Biden did say during the 2020 Democratic primary that \u201cno one, no one will be deported at all\u201d in his first 100 days as president. But Jordan claimed that this was the policy Biden actually implemented on his first day in office; Biden\u2019s actual first-day policy was considerably narrower. Biden\u2019s attempted 100-day pause also did not apply to people who engaged in or were suspected of terrorism or espionage, were seen to pose a national security risk, had waived their right to remain in the US, or whom the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement determined the law required to be removed. The pause was supposed to be in effect while the Department of Homeland Security conducted a review of immigration enforcement practices, but it was blocked by a federal judge shortly after it was announced. Rep. Ralph Norman strongly suggested the FBI had tipped off the media to its August search of  Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Florida for government documents in the former president\u2019s possession \u2013 while concealing its subsequent document searches of properties connected to Biden. Norman said: \u201cWhen I saw the raid at Mar-a-Lago \u2013 you know, the cameras, the FBI \u2013 and compare that to when they found Biden\u2019s, all of the documents he had, where was the media, where was the FBI? They kept it quiet early on, didn\u2019t let it out. The job of the next president is going to be getting rid of the insiders that are undermining this government, and you\u2019ve gotta clean house.\u201d Facts First: Norman\u2019s narrative is false. The FBI did not tip off the media to its search of Mar-a-Lago; CNN reported the next day that the search \u201chappened so quietly, so secretly, that it wasn\u2019t caught on camera at all.\u201d Rather, media outlets belatedly sent cameras to Mar-a-Lago because Peter Schorsch, publisher of the website Florida Politics, learned of the search from non-FBI sources and tweeted about it either after it was over or as it was just concluding, and because Trump himself made a public statement less than 20 minutes later confirming that a search had occurred. Schorsch told CNN on Thursday: \u201cI can, unequivocally, state that the FBI was not one of my two sources which alerted me to the raid.\u201d Brian Stelter, then CNN\u2019s chief media correspondent, wrote in his article the day after the search: \u201cBy the time local TV news cameras showed up outside the club, there was almost nothing to see. Websites used file photos of the Florida resort since there were no dramatic shots of the search.\u201d It\u2019s true that the public didn\u2019t find out until late January about the FBI\u2019s November search of Biden\u2019s former think tank office in Washington, which was conducted with the consent of Biden\u2019s legal team. But the belated presence of journalists at Mar-a-Lago on the day of the Trump search in August is not evidence of a double standard. And it\u2019s worth noting that media cameras were on the scene when Biden\u2019s beach home in Delaware was searched by the FBI in February. News outlets had set up a media \u201cpool\u201d to make sure any search there was recorded. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a former college and high school football coach, said, \u201cGoing into thousands of kids\u2019 homes and talking to parents every year recruiting, half the kids in this country \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about race, I\u2019m just talking about \u2013 half the kids in this country have one or no parent. And it\u2019s because of the attack on faith. People are losing faith because, for some reason, because the attack [on] God.\u201d Facts First: Tuberville\u2019s claim that half of American children don\u2019t have two parents is incorrect. Official figures from the Census Bureau show that, in 2021, about 70% of US children under the age of 18 lived with two parents and about 65% lived with two married parents. About 22% of children lived with only a mother, about 5% with only a father, and about 3% with no parent. But the Census Bureau has explained that even children who are listed as living with only one parent may have a second parent; children are listed as living with only one parent if, for example, one parent is deployed overseas with the military or if their divorced parents share custody of them. It is true that the percentage of US children living in households with two parents has been declining for decades. Still, Tuberville\u2019s statistic significantly exaggerated the current situation. His spokesperson told CNN on Thursday that the senator was speaking \u201canecdotally\u201d from his personal experience meeting with families as a football coach. Tuberville claimed that today\u2019s children are being \u201cindoctrinated\u201d in schools by \u201cwoke\u201d ideology and critical race theory. He then said, \u201cWe don\u2019t teach reading, writing and arithmetic anymore. You know, half the kids in this country, when they graduate \u2013 think about this: half the kids in this country, when they graduate, can\u2019t read their diploma.\u201d Facts First: This is false. While many Americans do struggle with reading, there is no basis for the claim that \u201chalf\u201d of high school graduates can\u2019t read a basic document like a diploma. \u201cMr. Tuberville does not know what he\u2019s talking about at all,\u201d said Patricia Edwards, a Michigan State University professor of language and literacy who is a past president of the International Literacy Association and the Literacy Research Association. Edwards said there is \u201cno evidence\u201d to support Tuberville\u2019s claim. She also said that people who can\u2019t read at all are highly unlikely to finish high school and that \u201csometimes politicians embellish information.\u201d Tuberville could have accurately said that a significant number of American teenagers and adults have reading trouble, though there is no apparent basis for connecting these struggles with supposed \u201cwoke\u201d indoctrination. The organization ProLiteracy pointed CNN to 2017 data that found 23% of Americans age 16 to 65 have \u201clow\u201d literacy skills in English. That\u2019s not \u201chalf,\u201d as ProLiteracy pointed out, and it includes people who didn\u2019t graduate from high school and people who are able to read basic text but struggle with more complex literacy tasks. The Tuberville spokesperson said the senator was speaking informally after having been briefed on other statistics about Americans\u2019 struggles with reading, like a report that half of adults can\u2019t read a book written at an eighth-grade level. Rep. Jim Jordan claimed of Biden: \u201cThe president of the United States stood in front of Independence Hall, called half the country fascists.\u201d Facts First: This is not true. Biden did not denounce even close to \u201chalf the country\u201d in this 2022 speech at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.  He made clear that he was speaking about a minority of Republicans. In the speech, in which he never used the word \u201cfascists,\u201d Biden warned that \u201cMAGA Republicans\u201d like Trump are \u201cextreme,\u201d \u201cdo not respect the Constitution\u201d and \u201cdo not believe in the rule of law.\u201d But he also emphasized that \u201cnot every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans.\u201d In other words, he made clear that he was talking about far less than half of Americans. Trump earned fewer than 75 million votes in 2020 in a country of more than 258 million adults, so even a hypothetical criticism of every single Trump voter would not amount to criticism of \u201chalf the country.\u201d Rep. Scott Perry claimed that \u201caverage citizens need to just at some point be willing to acknowledge and accept that every single facet of the federal government is weaponized against every single one of us.\u201d Perry said moments later, \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have the right to tell you that you can\u2019t buy a gas stove but that you must buy an electric vehicle.\u201d Facts First: This is nonsense. The federal government has not told people that they can\u2019t buy a gas stove or must buy an electric vehicle. The Biden administration has tried to encourage and incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles, but it has not tried to forbid the manufacture or purchase of traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines. Biden has set a goal of electric vehicles making up half of all new vehicles sold in the US by 2030. There was a January controversy about a Biden appointee to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, Richard Trumka Jr., saying that gas stoves pose a \u201chidden hazard,\u201d as they emit air pollutants, and that \u201cany option is on the table. Products that can\u2019t be made safe can be banned.\u201d But the commission as a whole has not shown support for a ban, and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a January press briefing: \u201cThe president does not support banning gas stoves. And the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is independent, is not banning gas stoves.\u201d Rep. Ralph Norman claimed that Biden had just laughed at a mother who lost two sons to fentanyl. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether y\u2019all saw, I just saw it this morning: Biden laughing at the mother who had two sons \u2013 to die, and he\u2019s basically laughing and saying the fentanyl came from the previous administration. Who cares where it came from? The fact is it\u2019s here,\u201d Norman said. Facts First: Norman\u2019s claim is false. Biden did not laugh at the mother who lost her sons to fentanyl, the anti-abortion activist Rebecca Kiessling; in a somber tone, he called her \u201ca poor mother who lost two kids to fentanyl.\u201d Rather, he proceeded to laugh about how Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had baselessly blamed the Biden administration for the young men\u2019s deaths even though the tragedy happened in mid-2020, during the Trump administration. You can watch the video of Biden\u2019s remarks here. Kiessling has demanded an apology from Biden. She is entitled to her criticism of Biden\u2019s remarks and his chuckle \u2013 but the video clearly shows Norman was wrong when he claimed Biden was \u201claughing at the mother.\u201d Rep. Kat Cammack told a story about the first hearing of the new Republican-led House select subcommittee on the supposed \u201cweaponization\u201d of the federal government. Cammack claimed she had asked a Democratic witness at this February hearing about his \u201cincredibly vitriolic\u201d Twitter feed in which, she claimed, he not only repeatedly criticized Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh but even went \u201cso far as to encourage people to harass this Supreme Court justice.\u201d Facts First: This story is false. The witness Cammack questioned in this February exchange at the subcommittee, former Obama administration deputy assistant attorney general Elliot Williams, did not encourage people to harass Kavanaugh. In fact, it\u2019s not even true that Cammack accused him at the February hearing of having encouraged people to harass Kavanaugh. Rather, at the hearing, she merely claimed that Williams had tweeted numerous critical tweets about Kavanaugh but had been \u201cunusually quiet\u201d on Twitter after an alleged assassination attempt against the justice. Clearly, not tweeting about the incident is not the same thing as encouraging harassment. Williams, now a CNN legal analyst (he appeared at the subcommittee hearing in his personal capacity), said in a Thursday email that he had \u201cno idea\u201d what Cammack was looking at on his innocuous Twitter feed. He said: \u201cI used to prosecute violent crimes, and clerked for two federal judges. Any suggestion that I\u2019ve ever encouraged harassment of anyone \u2013 and particularly any official of the United States \u2013 is insulting and not based in reality.\u201d Cammack\u2019s spokesperson responded helpfully on Thursday to CNN\u2019s initial queries about the story Cammack told at CPAC, explaining that she was referring to her February exchange with Williams. But the spokesperson stopped responding after CNN asked if Cammack was accurately describing this exchange with Williams and if they had any evidence of Williams actually having encouraged the harassment of Kavanaugh. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana boasted about the state of the country \u201cwhen Republicans were in charge.\u201d Among other claims about Trump\u2019s tenure, he said that \u201cin four years,\u201d Republicans \u201cdelivered 3.5% unemployment\u201d and \u201ccreated 8 million new jobs.\u201d Facts First: This is inaccurate in two ways. First, the economic numbers for the full \u201cfour years\u201d of Trump\u2019s tenure are much worse than these numbers Kennedy cited; Kennedy was actually referring to Trump\u2019s first three years while ignoring the fourth, which was marred by the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, there weren\u2019t \u201c8 million new jobs\u201d created even in Trump\u2019s first three years. Kennedy could have correctly said there was a 3.5% unemployment rate after three years of the Trump administration, but not after four. The unemployment rate skyrocketed early in Trump\u2019s fourth year, on account of the pandemic, before coming down again, and it was 6.3% when Trump left office in early 2021. (It fell to 3.4% this January under Biden, better than in any month under Trump.) And while the economy added about 6.7 million jobs under Trump before the pandemic-related crash of March and April 2020, that\u2019s not the \u201c8 million jobs\u201d Kennedy claimed \u2013 and the economy ended up shedding millions of jobs in Trump\u2019s fourth year. Over the full four years of Trump\u2019s tenure, the economy netted a loss of about 2.7 million jobs. Lara Trump, Donald Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law and an adviser to his 2020 campaign, claimed that the last time a CPAC crowd was gathered at this venue in Maryland, in February 2020, \u201cWe had the lowest unemployment in American history.\u201d After making other boasts about Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, she said, \u201cBut how quickly it all changed.\u201d She added, \u201cUnder Joe Biden, America is crumbling.\u201d Facts First: Lara Trump\u2019s claim about February 2020 having \u201cthe lowest unemployment in American history\u201d is false. The unemployment rate was 3.5% at the time \u2013 tied for the lowest since 1969, but not the all-time lowest on record, which was 2.5% in 1953. And while Lara Trump didn\u2019t make an explicit claim about unemployment under Biden, it\u2019s not true that things are worse today on this measure; again, the most recent unemployment rate, 3.4% for January 2023, is better than the rate at the time of CPAC\u2019s 2020 conference or at any other time during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Multiple speakers at CPAC decried the high number of fentanyl overdose deaths. But some of the speakers inflated that number while attacking Biden\u2019s immigration policy. Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump administration official, claimed that \u201cin the last 12 months in America, deaths by fentanyl poisoning totaled 110,000 Americans.\u201d He blamed \u201cBiden\u2019s open border\u201d for these deaths. Rep. Scott Perry claimed: \u201cMeanwhile over on this side of the border, where there isn\u2019t anybody, they\u2019re running this fentanyl in; it\u2019s killing 100,000 Americans \u2013 over 100,000 Americans \u2013 a year.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that there are more than 100,000 fentanyl deaths per year. That is the total number of deaths from all drug overdoses in the US; there were 106,699 such deaths in 2021. But the number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, primarily fentanyl, is smaller \u2013 70,601 in 2021. Fentanyl-related overdoses are clearly a major problem for the country and by far the biggest single contributor to the broader overdose problem. Nonetheless, claims of \u201c110,000\u201d and \u201cover 100,000\u201d fentanyl deaths per year are significant exaggerations. And while the number of overdose deaths and fentanyl-related deaths increased under Biden in 2021, it was also troubling under Trump in 2020 \u2013 91,799 total overdose deaths and 56,516 for synthetic opioids other than methadone. It\u2019s also worth noting that fentanyl is largely smuggled in by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking past other parts of the border. Contrary to frequent Republican claims, the border is not \u201copen\u201d; border officers have seized thousands of pounds of fentanyl under Biden.",

            "article_content": "\u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d has long been the anthem to Donald Trump triumphantly walking off stage after his rallies. But the ex-president\u2019s entire political career, the modern Republican Party and a vast conservative media empire are based on the exact opposite premise of the Rolling Stones\u2019 song: giving the party base exactly what it wants to hear \u2013 whether it is true or not. Fox News is the latest example of opinion formers on the right exposed for being held hostage to the fury they helped to incite. Extraordinary revelations this week from a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems showed that Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch admitted under oath that some of the channel\u2019s top stars endorsed false claims that the 2020 election was stolen as he tried to stop viewers from defecting. Previous disclosures showed some of those Fox hosts knew they were peddling lies but were worried they\u2019d alienate their audience if they told the truth about Trump\u2019s false claims. Fox faces an 'existential threat' from its multibillion-dollar defamation cases The new details underscored how key players on the right feel they have no choice but to appease, satisfy and further inflame the voters and viewers on whom their profits or hopes of political power depend. The GOP\u2019s most fervent, constantly self-radicalizing voters have long led its leaders. GOP luminaries who resist the tide, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, ex-Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, see their careers expire. Those that buy in \u2013 like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, now a member of the House GOP leadership team \u2013 can rocket to prominence. But such a strategy can risk being turned into a Faustian bargain. In Fox\u2019s case, Murdoch\u2019s testimony left the network in serious legal jeopardy and shredded its journalistic reputation. Some media commentators would argue that Murdoch\u2019s entire business model \u2013 using television stations in his native Australia and tabloid newspapers like The Sun in Britain, as well as Fox News in the US \u2013 has evolved from seizing upon and feeding political anger. And while he\u2019s more known for backing conservatives, Murdoch has switched sides when business demands \u2013 for instance, when The Sun endorsed the British Labour Party\u2019s Tony Blair over the fading Conservative Party in a 1997 general election. The 10 biggest revelations from Dominion's explosive Fox News legal filing There are also signs that the billionaire publisher may finally be getting buyer\u2019s remorse over Trump given the headline in his New York Post after the ex-president\u2019s low energy 2024 campaign launch in November, which read, \u201cBeen there, Don that.\u201d As he said in a deposition made public in a court filing on Monday in the Dominion case: \u201cIt is not red or blue, it is green,\u201d referring to the color of a dollar. The Republican politicians who appear on Fox are influenced by a similar calculation of what the political market will bear. Their unfiltered adoption of much of the doctrine favored by the conservative grassroots ultimately stretched American democracy to the limit. Catering to that base helped fuel the rise of Trump in 2016, as he shattered the Republican establishment presidential field. GOP lawmakers whose hold on power depended on not crossing the reality-star-turned-president then allowed Trump to run riot. That helped foster an unstoppable radical tide that led to the US Capitol insurrection in 2021 and eventually to Republicans acquitting him in not one but two impeachment dramas. There is every sign that the dominance of this Republican base still reigns supreme as a new GOP presidential campaign dawns. Trump is still the biggest name in the race, but his top potential rival is expected to be DeSantis, who bills himself as a hardline leader who can implement Trumpism better than its author but without the chaos that enveloped his presidency. In interviews with roughly two dozen members of the House\u2019s \u201cMAGA\u201d wing, many told CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona and Manu Raju that they were not yet ready to commit to Trump \u2013 although there was excitement on the far right about DeSantis. McCarthy grants access to Capitol security footage to January 6 defendants The huge power of the Republican base was the secret sauce that forced new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to make concessions to the most radical representatives in the conference after 15 rounds of voting he needed to win his job. McCarthy had earlier watched as two predecessors, former Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, tried to resist the GOP\u2019s far right insurgency and lost their job. As McCarthy showed by handing Fox host Tucker Carlson access to hours of Capitol Hill security footage last week \u2013 despite Carlson\u2019s conspiracy theories about January 6, 2021 \u2013 his speakership is a totally owned subsidiary of the GOP\u2019s most extreme elements. McCarthy\u2019s dominance by the same GOP base that Murdoch worried about driving away is one reason why a coming showdown with the White House over raising the government\u2019s borrowing limit has so many financial experts fretting about a possible default that could rattle the global economy. There are also signs that the power of the Republican grassroots is leading the GOP down a dark and futile road. The party that defeated Soviet Communism now spends its time undermining US democracy. Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud \u2013 amplified by Fox and other conservative networks \u2013 delight activists but scare off many moderate and suburban voters, who have contributed to the GOP\u2019s loses in key swing states in recent general elections. Following Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020, there\u2019s a major question whether the no-compromise populism that the base demands can win national elections. The straddle between winning a party\u2019s base voters and trying to court middle America has long tested Democratic and Republican nominees when they have to pivot to a general election. In 2024, this political leap may require supreme political skill from whoever emerges from what could be the GOP\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d primary. Trump\u2019s astute political insight in 2016 was to see what no other Republican candidate did \u2013 that his winning coalition was angry and frustrated by years of foreign wars and globalized trade policies that many blamed for sending industrial jobs overseas. These voters were tired of conventional politicians and despised \u201celites\u201d in business, politics and the media who they thought condescended to them. They also balked at political correctness and a wave of social and cultural change, permissive immigration policies and the diverse coalition that secured two terms for President Barack Obama. They wanted to send someone to Washington to break all the rules and to drain what Trump referred to as \u201cthe swamp.\u201d This was why Trump, an apparently unlikely clarion of the people after spending his life in Manhattan and flying around the country on a private Boeing with gold-plated fittings, was the perfect candidate for the moment. He was condemned by liberals for his extreme, racialized and sometimes profane rhetoric. But for his crowds, Trump\u2019s early rallies were huge fun \u2013 more like stand-up comedy shows than conventional presidential events. Here was someone who was shouting out loud what millions of Americans had believed for years but felt constrained from saying because of social convention. Many commentators decried Trump\u2019s demagoguery but fewer examined the social, economic and political reasons for his rise. DeSantis in his new book explains the changes in the GOP base that led to Trump and that the Florida governor will seek to harness if he makes a run for president in 2024. Four takeaways from DeSantis' new book rehashing his culture clashes as Florida governor \u201cThis persistent theme \u2014 that Republicans in Washington fail to effectively represent the values of the people who elect them \u2013 foreshadowed the nomination of Donald Trump in 2016,\u201d DeSantis writes in \u201cThe Courage to be Free,\u201d published on Tuesday. \u201cThe chasm between the aspirations of the GOP voter base and the behavior of party leaders in Washington would continue to grow wider in the ensuing years.\u201d DeSantis complains that politicians who go to Washington forget where they come from \u2013 and soon become instruments of a political system that works against their constituents\u2019 interests. Yet issues like the need to raise the debt ceiling to keep the government solvent and the economy running or key foreign policy questions, like US support for Ukraine, sometimes require leaders to take a different view of the national interest than prevails back at home. Many politicians face a moment when, for reasons of conscience or political reality, they risk alienating their closest supporters. But sometimes there is no choice but to spend this political capital. The key to Trump\u2019s appeal, however, is that he never did. The ex-president\u2019s tearing at democratic norms after the election in 2020 was his version of telling voters what they, and he, wanted to hear. He allowed millions of Americans to believe that he had not lost to President Joe Biden and that the election was stained by widespread fraud \u2013 even though there was no basis for his claims. The Fox News opinion hosts who amplified his falsehoods were guilty of exactly the same transgression \u2013 not to protect political careers but apparently to save their lucrative livelihoods. Trump had foreshadowed this marriage of convenience between his presidency and the conservative media infrastructure in an appearance at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Kansas City in 2018. \u201cStick with us. Don\u2019t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. \u2026 What you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re reading is not what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Facing a surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border and on the heels of a crisis, White House and Department of Homeland Security officials began discussing more restrictive policies that would keep migrants from coming to the US. It was the summer of 2021, just months after a surge of unaccompanied migrant children caught the administration flat-footed and put into sharp focus the immigration challenges ahead for President Joe Biden. At the time, White House lawyers knocked down one of the ideas: Forcing asylum seekers to find refuge in countries on their way to the US or be turned back. They said it would likely be blocked by the courts, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. But nearly two years later, the administration announced a policy like the one floated among officials before \u2013 fielding fierce criticism from allies who argued the effort had echoes of the Trump era and crystallizing the shift in Biden\u2019s approach to the border, a political vulnerability going into the 2024 presidential election. \u201cAs a matter of good governance, we take all legal considerations into account before putting any policy forward, and the recent proposed rule reflects those considerations,\u201d an administration official said in a statement. One source close to the White House described the latest policy announcement, which largely bars migrants from seeking asylum in the US if they passed through another country, as \u201cputting lipstick on a pig.\u201d The aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic in the Western Hemisphere put the Biden administration in a difficult position from the outset, as migrants began fleeing deteriorating conditions back home in record numbers. Proposals to reform the immigration system fell by the wayside as officials grappled with a record number of migrants arriving at the US southern border, sources told CNN. But policy ideas, like the new asylum rule, that may have been hard to stomach before are now taking shape as the administration tries to stave off another crisis and Republican attacks. \u201cThey went from not wanting to do tough stuff to realizing they have no choice,\u201d one source familiar with discussions told CNN. CNN reached out to the White House and Department of Homeland Security for comment. Some Biden allies have likened the new asylum rule, which is likely to take effect in May, to a Trump-era policy that sought to bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border. Biden administration officials have rejected the comparison to the Trump administration, saying that it\u2019s not a categorical ban on asylum and emphasizing efforts to expand access to legal pathways to the US, including a recently launched parole program for certain nationalities. \u201cThis was not our first preference or even our second,\u201d an administration official previously told reporters, stressing efforts to open legal pathways to the US, including use of an app, and underscoring the onus is on Congress to pass reform. The shifting migration patterns \u2013 which have put a strain on federal resources \u2013 have in part prompted the administration to consider new measures, especially as border authorities have encountered an increasing number of Cubans, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans. The US is largely barred from deporting migrants from those nationalities back to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations. The US has since begun sending migrants from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua to Mexico under a Covid-era border restriction, known as Title 42, and opened a separate program that allows migrants of those nationalities and Haiti to apply to legally come to the United States. Thousands of migrants have already applied, and border encounters of those nationalities have dropped significantly. Immigrant advocates and former Biden officials have slammed the return of migrants to Mexico and the latest policy rollout, calling it a pivot from Biden\u2019s pledge to restore asylum. Biden has long promised to take a humane approach to the situation at the border \u2013 a promise that some critics say the current White House could risk breaking with some of their restrictive border policies. \u201cThe original sin was relying on President Trump\u2019s Title 42 instead of taking the early hits to get out of it and build legal pathways to relieve pressure off the border,\u201d said Alida Garcia, vice president of advocacy at FWD.us and a former White House official. \u201cNow, we\u2019re left with this terrible mess that is only going to increase children crossing on their own and empower cartels,\u201d Garcia added. The balance of power within the White House over immigration has also changed over the last two years, with progressives largely leaving the administration and people with more moderate positions having more influence. In the first months of the administration, there was often disagreement among moderates and progressives within the administration about how to address migrants at the border, leaving little room for solutions or decisions. The management of the US southern border not only exposed fractures within the administration but also within Biden\u2019s own party about how to address an influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border and a buckling immigration system. Following last week\u2019s announcement, multiple Democratic lawmakers immediately criticized the move to restrict asylum. \u201cI am deeply outraged by the Biden Administration\u2019s proposed ban on asylum seekers,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York in a statement. \u201cOur immigration policies already fall short in supporting asylum-seekers, but this ban would go further by attacking the very bedrock of our most basic commitment to asylum.\u201d Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who has previously been a critic of Biden\u2019s management of the border, argued that providing incentives for people to follow a lawful pathway to the US is important to avoid a surge at the border. \u201cThey have shifted. It looks like there\u2019s a movement to the middle,\u201d Cuellar said of the Biden administration. \u201cI think that\u2019s good policy, especially for people at the border.\u201d \u201cYou have to have something in place. You have to have policy in place when Title 42 goes away May 11,\u201d he added. The administration has repeatedly called on Congress to pass immigration reform, which hasn\u2019t happened in decades and has left presidents relying on a patchwork of policies to stem the ongoing flow of migrants. In the interim, the administration has leaned on Title 42 to turn away certain migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border. With the clock ticking on its expiration in May and amid ongoing litigation, officials are also considering other enforcement measures as tens of thousands of migrants continue to move in the Western Hemisphere. Among the plans being considered by the administration is a fast-track deportation process known as \u201cexpedited removal.\u201d While Mexico has been taking migrants under Title 42 and previously under a Trump-era border policy known as \u201cremain in Mexico,\u201d the plan would appear to mark the first time Mexico would take back non-Mexican deportees at a large scale. The Department of Homeland Security has denied reports of the plan.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Thursday made a forceful argument against Republicans by highlighting his support for Social Security and Medicare, an appeal to the senior-rich Sunshine State as he makes moves toward a 2024 reelection announcement. Biden took his State of the Union argument to the home state of GOP Sen. Rick Scott, seizing a political opportunity to go after Scott\u2019s proposal to sunset federal legislation \u2013 including Social Security and Medicare \u2013 every five years, and poking at Floridian and former President Donald Trump, who has announced his 2024 candidacy. The president sought to draw a sharp contrast with Scott, with White House aides placing a copy of Scott\u2019s proposal on every seat for Biden\u2019s Tampa event. The president referenced Florida\u2019s senior demographics as he made a broad pitch for his efforts to lower health care costs, noting the state has the \u201chighest percentage of seniors of any state in the nation,\u201d a group he lost by 10 points to Trump in 2020 and an area he could seek to rebuild support in 2024. Referencing his \u201cspirited debate\u201d with Republicans at the State of the Union, Biden called Scott\u2019s proposal \u201coutrageous\u201d and vowed to veto it. \u201cThe very idea the senator from Florida wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every five years I find to be somewhat outrageous. So outrageous that you might not even believe it,\u201d he said, pulling out a pamphlet detailing Scott\u2019s plan. He continued, \u201cIn case there\u2019s any doubt, just yesterday, he confirmed that he still likes his proposal. Well I guarantee you: it will not happen. I will veto it. I will defend Social Security and Medicare.\u201d The speech was Biden\u2019s latest opportunity to highlight the proposal and drive home his message that the GOP aims to end entitlement programs. White House advisers don\u2019t view the Sunshine State as a key piece of the electoral map in a 2024 run, aware that the state has moved sharply away from Democrats but as a place where it can highlight the issues that dramatically pop in their polling, like Medicare and Social Security. But there\u2019s no state with a larger population that utilizes those programs and most critically. And there are no two politicians they want to spar with more on the programs than Scott and Gov. Ron DeSantis. \u201cWe want this fight,\u201d a senior White House official told CNN ahead of the event. \u201cWe relish this fight.\u201d In anticipation of Biden\u2019s visit, Scott ran an ad criticizing Biden and claiming the president is to blame for cuts to Medicare, concluding: \u201cBiden should resign.\u201d The senator repeated his criticism of Biden\u2019s visit on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d Thursday, disputing Biden\u2019s characterization of his proposal and calling the president a \u201cfailure.\u201d \u201cLook at what the people in my state care about. Inflation \u2013 he caused it. Gas prices \u2013 he caused it. We got open border \u2013 he caused it. \u2026 Look at the Chinese spy balloon. He let the thing go clear across this country before he did anything. And there is no transparency in his administration.\u201d Referring to Scott\u2019s ad, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said it \u201conly cements that congressional Republicans are targeting Medicare. Repealing the AARP-backed Inflation Reduction Act, as Scott\u2019s now calling for, would impose the biggest cut to Medicare benefits in decades.\u201d \u201cEvery time Rick Scott opens his mouth, he proves the president\u2019s point. The man who got rich overseeing the biggest Medicare fraud in history is protesting too much \u2013 again,\u201d Bates added. The president\u2019s decision to highlight Scott\u2019s proposal drew the fiercest reaction from Republicans during Tuesday\u2019s address to Congress, eliciting loud jeers by accusing some Republicans of supporting changes to the popular entitlement programs. The Republican Study Committee also previously put out a budget plan that calls for making several changes to Social Security and Medicare that would amount to cutting the programs\u2019 benefits for future senior citizens. Neither that proposal nor Scott\u2019s plans made it far \u2013 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly dismissed it, saying that the GOP would not include in its agenda a bill that sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years. And newly anointed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has pledged not to touch the programs even as he seeks budget cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling this summer. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Biden\u2019s politicking, and it could allow him an opening to improve on his showing among seniors in the 2020 election \u2013 particularly in Florida, a state where he lost voters 65 and older to Trump by 10 points in 2020, wider than his 5-point deficit nationally. During his remarks Thursday, Biden added a twist to a previous promise: \u201cI know that a lot of Republicans, their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare. Well, let me say this: if that\u2019s your dream, I\u2019m your nightmare.\u201d Biden specifically highlighted provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year aimed at letting Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices. He also went after Republicans for \u201ctrying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act for years\u201d and efforts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, offering a reelection argument as he vowed to veto any such moves. \u201cMake no mistake about it: They tried to raise the cost of prescription drugs or abolish the Affordable Care Act, I will veto it,\u201d Biden said. In an indirect reference to Trump, Biden pointed to bipartisan legislation including the infrastructure bill, CHIPS and Science Act, PACT Act aimed at supporting veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, and legislation codifying same-sex marriage. \u201cWe did that in a bipartisan way \u2013 Democrats and Republicans did it. I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t acknowledge that, it\u2019s part of what\u2019s making the country great again,\u201d Biden said, alluding to Trump\u2019s MAGA slogan. He later took aim at Trump on the national debt: \u201cThe last fellow who had this job, who never showed up at the transition, I might add, but the last guy to have this job, he increased the federal debt, which took over 200 years to accumulate. \u2026 Just in four years, he added to that federal debt of over 200 years, by 25%.\u201d The visit to Wisconsin and the message in Florida show that the president\u2019s State of the Union back-and-forth may have been unscripted, but the lines were very intentional in trying to draw a response, according to several officials. \u201cThey walked right into the trap,\u201d the close adviser told CNN. \u201cChaos and extremes.\u201d Asked if that\u2019s how they viewed Scott and DeSantis, the adviser chuckled: \u201cThe most chaos. The most extreme.\u201d Scott is not Biden\u2019s only rival in the state. DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential contender, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration, especially over immigration policy. The relationship between the two men perhaps hit its lowest point in September of last year, when DeSantis orchestrated two flights carrying migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Biden accused DeSantis of \u201cplaying politics with human beings,\u201d while DeSantis contended the stunt had worked in getting the White House\u2019s attention on the border crisis. As Biden touches down in Tampa, Florida, lawmakers meeting in the state Capitol are considering an expansion of the migrant transport program that would give DeSantis more power to move recent asylum seekers from border states to Democratic-leaning jurisdictions. The move, expected to pass this week in a special session, is intended to lift legal hurdles that have stalled the program in the months after the initial planes took off, potentially setting off another showdown between DeSantis and Biden over immigration. DeSantis\u2019 monumental victory in his November reelection \u2013 a 19-point shellacking of Democrat Charlie Crist, who Biden campaigned for in the final days of the race \u2013 further energized conservatives who want to see the Republican Party nominate Florida\u2019s governor to take on the incumbent Democratic president in 2024. His victory also left Democrats in Florida utterly devastated and fearing the national party will decide to leave the Sunshine State off the electoral map in two years and instead focus resources on protecting Biden\u2019s wins in other key Midwest and Southwest battlegrounds. \u201cI am hopeful that by coming to Tampa he is telling the country that Democrats are not writing off Florida and that the performance of his administration over the last two years can ensure the benefits in Florida,\u201d said former Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, a Democrat. \u201cBut yes, we have some structural issues we have to deal with.\u201d Those structural issues include a massive shift in voter registration patterns. When Biden was on the ticket for the first time in Florida as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate, Democrats saw a historic wave of new voters and the party outnumbered registered Republicans by nearly 700,000. By the time he ran for president in 2020, the Democratic advantage was under 100,000 voters. Now, Republicans outnumber Democrats here by nearly 400,000. Meanwhile, the Florida Democratic Party is leaderless after the abrupt resignation of former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz as party chair, and it has struggled to raise money in a state that is notoriously expensive and complicated to campaign because of its vast, multilingual media markets. It won\u2019t help the case of Florida Democrats that Biden lost the Sunshine State to Trump in 2020 despite a $100 million injection by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. But forgoing the state\u2019s 30 electoral college votes is a tough way for Democrats to start in 2024. \u201cIt can be a game changer in a presidential cycle,\u201d Buckhorn said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s expensive. Yes, it\u2019s complicated and we have ground to make up. But it\u2019s ground that we used to own.\u201d CNN\u2019s Shawna Mizelle contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden brought his State of the Union populist economic messaging to Wisconsin on Wednesday, firing back at Republicans and highlighting US manufacturing in a preview of an expected 2024 argument in the battleground state. Biden made clear that he was willing to continue the fight as he hit the road, reigniting the social safety net argument with Republicans that sparked one of the most memorable moments in Tuesday\u2019s speech. The argument highlighted Biden\u2019s attempts to shift his message away from the \u201cextreme MAGA\u201d and \u201cmega-MAGA\u201d talking points of the 2022 midterm election. \u201cLast night, I reported on the State of the Union: It is strong, it is strong,\u201d Biden told the room of union workers at a LiUNA training facility in DeForest, Wisconsin, reiterating much of his economic messaging and highlighting key legislative accomplishments. But as he quipped that he had a \u201cspirited debate last night\u201d with Republicans on Social Security and Medicare, Biden offered a new warning to the GOP. \u201cLook \u2013 a lot of Republicans, their dream is to cut Social Security and Medicare. Well, let me just say this: It\u2019s your dream, but I\u2019m gonna have my veto pen make it a nightmare,\u201d he said. Republicans repeatedly heckled Biden during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, ignoring the occasional shushes from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. In moments throughout the address, Republicans in the House chamber shouted at Biden, protesting his approach to a wide range of issues such as immigration, Social Security and Medicare spending and the debt ceiling. Biden said that some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, \u201cseemed shocked\u201d when he highlighted their colleagues\u2019 efforts to cut those social safety net programs, holding up a \u201cbrochure\u201d with Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s plan to require all federal legislation \u2013 including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 to be authorized every five years. He referenced quotes on the matter from Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who received boos and hisses, and Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee. \u201cThere\u2019s a senator named Mike Lee who was also yelling, \u2018Liar, liar, house on fire\u2019 kind of stuff last night. \u2026 They played last night, something I didn\u2019t even know existed, a video of him saying, \u2018I\u2019m here right now to tell you one thing you\u2019ve probably never heard from a politician: It\u2019ll be my objective to phase out Social Security,\u2019\u201d he said. Biden continued, \u201cSounds pretty clear to me \u2013 how about you? But they (Republican lawmakers) sure didn\u2019t like me calling him on it.\u201d Shortly after Biden\u2019s remarks near Madison, PBS NewsHour\u2019s Judy Woodruff asked him if he was expecting the kind of reaction he got in the House chamber. \u201cFrom the folks that did it, I was,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe vast of majority of Republicans weren\u2019t that way, but you know, there\u2019s still a significant element of what I call the \u2018MAGA Republicans.\u2019\u201d The president told Woodruff that McCarthy \u201cwas gracious,\u201d and so were \u201ca lot of the members.\u201d As for last night\u2019s \u201cconversion\u201d of some Republicans, he offered skepticism during his speech: \u201cI sure hope that\u2019s true. I\u2019ll believe it when I see it when their budget\u2019s laid down with the cuts they\u2019re proposing. But looks like we negotiated a deal last night on the floor of the House of Representatives.\u201d Earlier in the speech, Biden attempted to make a broader argument for working together with GOP lawmakers, touting the successes of his first two years in office. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do it again?\u201d he asked. \u201cPeople sent us a clear message: Fighting for the sake of fighting gets us nowhere. We\u2019re getting things done,\u201d he said, before going on to draw clear arguments against his Republican colleagues. And he again called on Congress to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit during his earlier remarks, warning against the \u201cchaos\u201d he said Republicans are \u201csuggesting.\u201d Biden also fired back at a television commentator he heard aboard Air Force One lamenting his focus on junk fees: \u201cJunk fees may not matter to the wealthy people, but they matter of most folks like the home I grew up in. They add hundreds of dollars a month to make it harder to pay your bills or afford that family trip. I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and think they can get away with it.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

            "article_content": "When President Joe Biden delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday night, he will face a challenge that also confronted each of his four immediate predecessors: responding to an election that ended his party\u2019s unified control of Congress. Like Biden, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all entered the White House with their party also controlling the House and Senate. That initially allowed all of them to drive an aggressive legislative agenda. But like Biden, each of them during their presidency saw voters send a signal of discontent by shifting control of one or both congressional chambers to the other party. In their first State of the Union after that defeat, each president grappled directly with the new power alignment in Washington. But in their reaction to that uncomfortable reality, Biden\u2019s predecessors offer contrasting models for how he may approach Tuesday\u2019s speech. Obama and Clinton, the two Democrats over that period, were the most conciliatory and even contrite, congratulating the new majority, pledging to work across party lines and signaling they would seek the political center. Trump, after the most cursory feints toward bipartisanship, was by far the most confrontational, reasserting his most polarizing campaign themes and warning the new Democratic House majority against investigating him. Bush fell in between: gracious and conciliatory both in tone and on his domestic agenda but unbending over his plans to escalate the Iraq War. Many observers I spoke with expect Biden to offer a synthesis as well: much more conciliatory toward the new majority than Trump, but not nearly as deferential as Obama and Clinton. Because it is so central to his political identity, Biden is likely to stress his commitment to cooperating across party lines and tout his success at completing multiple bipartisan bills over the past two years. But on balance, it would not be surprising if Biden\u2019s blend of compromise and confrontation lands somewhat closer to his Republican, than Democratic, predecessors. \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty clear that [Biden] is going to pledge to cooperate where he can and then to confront where he must,\u201d said Paul Begala, a political adviser to Clinton and CNN political commentator. The president may feel more comfortable tilting that dial more toward confrontation than Clinton or Obama did, because Biden did not suffer nearly as many midterm losses as either of them \u2013 or for that matter, Trump and Bush. \u201cI think Biden\u2019s political situation is stronger not weaker after the midterm because the expectation was they would lose the House by more and would lose the Senate as well,\u201d said Pete Wehner, a White House adviser to George W. Bush. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t repudiated in the midterm like any of the others were.\u201d Each of Biden\u2019s four predecessors surrendered many more House seats in the midterm election that ended their unified control of Congress. Bush lost more than 30 in 2006, Trump more than 40 in 2018, Clinton more than 50 in 1994, and Obama more than 60 in 2010 (the biggest midterm reversal for either party since 1938). Bush, Clinton, and Obama also lost at least six Senate seats as well. By contrast, while Republicans did narrowly recapture the House, Democrats far outperformed expectations in 2022, surrendering only 10 seats in the chamber and actually gaining a Senate seat (as well as control of more governorships and state legislatures). Biden\u2019s political situation, by many measures, remains tenuous. His approval rating in most polls remains stuck well below 50%, a critical threshold of strength for a president, and surveys show most Americans are downbeat about the economy, uncertain about his physical and mental capacity and unconvinced he has accomplished much in office. Yet the 2022 election demonstrated that an unusually large numbers of voters somewhat dissatisfied with Biden and the economy were still willing to support Democratic candidates because they viewed Republicans as too extreme \u2013 a dynamic that could buoy him again in 2024. \u201cI think he\u2019s got a pretty easy hand in terms of what you try and do with a State of the Union,\u201d says Wehner, the former Bush aide. \u201cOne is you portray your case and your agenda as reasonable and responsible. And then what you try and do is put your opponents in a box, which is to portray them as extreme, as reckless, as irresponsible and radical if they oppose you. The advantage Joe Biden has is the party opposing him is in many respects, reckless, irresponsible and extreme.\u201d The State of the Union, by its very structure, encourages the president to strike a magnanimous tone. Though the address doesn\u2019t command as large a national television audience as it once did, the viewership remains far larger than for a president\u2019s typical appearance. Like football announcers at the Super Bowl, presidents and their teams recognize that in the State of the Union their audience includes viewers who don\u2019t usually pay much attention to what they do and might be tuning in just this one time a year. \u201cClearly they are not speaking to Congress, they are speaking to the public \u2013 and they are speaking to a bigger audience than they normally have,\u201d said George C. Edwards III, a professor of political science emeritus at Texas A& M who studies presidential rhetoric. \u201cThey want to present themselves as statemen, clearly. \u2026 They want to be above the political fray; they don\u2019t want to be just a politician.\u201d The first State of the Union after losing control of one or both chambers is always difficult for a president. Divided government reduces their ability to advance their legislative priorities and exposes them to combative Congressional investigations. The physical presence of a House Speaker from the other party sitting behind him reminds each president that he no longer holds unqualified control of the legislative agenda or the political spotlight. Clinton, for instance, seemed so rattled by his losses in 1994 that he delivered a meandering, nearly 90-minute speech that continued for a full 23 paragraphs even after he finally announced, \u201cWell, my fellow Americans, that\u2019s my agenda for America\u2019s future.\u201d As I wrote at the time, Clinton \u201cseemed reluctant to leave the podium \u2013 as if he recognized that once he ceded the stage, the political initiative would return to the man sitting behind him, House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.\u201d But, while it might have been through gritted teeth, Obama, Bush and Clinton all held to the \u201cstatesman\u201d posture by explicitly congratulating the new majority from the other party early in their first post-loss State of the Union. Bush was the most elaborately gracious, noting that Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, sitting behind him, had just become the House\u2019s first female speaker. In the very first line of his 2007 State of the Union address (after losing control of both the House and Senate in 2006), Bush declared: \u201cTonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own \u2013 as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker.\u201d Obama, Bush and Clinton also explicitly courted the voters who had just rejected their party in the previous election. For each, that effort began long before the speech: in press conferences immediately after their midterm losses, Bush described the 2006 results as a \u201cthumpin\u2019\u201d while Obama referred to the 2010 GOP sweep as a \u201cshellacking.\u201d In the State of the Union itself, each of them sought to reassure dissatisfied voters that he heard their message. In his 1995 address, Clinton framed the GOP sweep the previous fall (which carried them to majorities in both the House and Senate) as an extension of the demand for change that powered his victory two years earlier. In both those elections, Clinton declared, \u201cI must say \u2026 we didn\u2019t hear America singing, we heard America shouting. And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say: We hear you. We will work together.\u201d Clinton went further by openly acknowledging his own errors during his often chaotic first two years. \u201cI am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor,\u201d he said early in the speech. Later, referring to his failed effort to pass a universal health care program, he admitted: \u201cI know that last year \u2026 we bit off more than we could chew.\u201d Begala, the former adviser, says Clinton was comfortable conceding missteps so openly because that humility had been key to his revival in Arkansas after he lost his first reelection as governor in 1980. \u201cClinton was familiar with that pattern,\u201d Begala said. \u201cPlus he was confident in his ability to resurrect his career.\u201d Obama, in his 2011 speech, was not as openly contrite, but also offered an extensive plea for bipartisan cooperation. His address was shaped by the shooting, just over two weeks before, of Rep. Gabby Giffords in Arizona; some Republicans and Democrats, in response, crossed the typical partisan separation in the chamber to sit together during the speech, as a way to symbolize their desire to cool partisan hostilities. \u201cWhat comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow,\u201d Obama declared. \u201cThat\u2019s what the people who sent us here expect of us.  With their votes, they\u2019ve determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties. \u2026 We will move forward together, or not at all.\u201d Notably, Obama and Clinton both reinforced the rhetorical calls for bipartisanship by emphasizing policy proposals they believed would appeal across party lines. After the failure of his massive universal health care plan in 1994, Clinton invited Republicans to \u201cwork together\u201d to pursue incremental changes \u201cstep by step.\u201d He pledged his determination to control the deficit and reform the federal government\u2019s operation: \u201cI think we all agree that we have to change the way the government works,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cLet\u2019s make it\u2026less costly and smaller \u2013 leaner, not meaner.\u201d That statement was a major step toward Clinton\u2019s more famous declaration in his 1996 State of the Union that \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d Throughout his 2011 speech, Obama also repeatedly stressed his commitment to reducing the deficit. Bush in 2007 praised ideas he believed would appeal to the new Democratic House and Senate majorities: education reform and a comprehensive immigration plan that linked more border security with a pathway to legal status for millions of undocumented migrants. Yet while offering conciliation, and even contrition, Clinton, Obama and Bush all blended confrontation into their first post-loss State of the Union. Clinton said he would work with Republicans on the deficit but drew a hard line against cuts in Social Security and Medicare and also vowed to preserve the assault weapon ban he had passed in 1994. Obama promised to fight any efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act he had passed in 2010 and to oppose a permanent extension of Bush\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy. Dan Pfeiffer, Obama\u2019s White House communications director, told me the president was acutely conscious of not appearing to give as much ground to arguments from the other party as Clinton did with his declaration that the era of big government was over. \u201cYou wanted to acknowledge the country had sent a message and you had heard that message,\u201d said Pfeiffer. \u201cBut you did not want to go as far as \u2018the era of big government is over,\u2019 which seemed to many a waving of the white flag.\u201d Bush, in his first speech after losing Congressional control, dug in more emphatically than Clinton or Obama. Despite his conciliatory language and outreach to Democrats on domestic policy Bush guaranteed a season of confrontation with the new Congressional majorities by the policy he announced two weeks before his address: a \u201csurge\u201d of additional troops into Iraq to try to break an escalating cycle of sectarian violence. To put it mildly, Bush was not given to public expressions of doubt, but he offered an implicit concession to his critics when he acknowledged, \u201cThis is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we\u2019re in.\u201d Yet he recognized he was lighting a political firestorm with his decision to deploy more troops, after an election in which disenchantment and exhaustion with the war had fueled the Democratic gains. \u201cBush wasn\u2019t temperamentally confrontational, he wasn\u2019t looking for a fight in Congress,\u201d said Wehner, now a senior fellow at The Trinity Forum, a faith-based thinktank. \u201cBut this was something he felt was important, and if it required him\u2026to lean against the winds, he was certainly willing to do that.\u201d Of the four previous presidents who lost unified control of Congress during their tenure, Trump\u2019s speech stands apart. He was alone among the four in refusing to congratulate the new Democratic House majority \u2013 or even to acknowledge their victory. (Despite losing over 40 House seats, the morning after the election he tweeted about the many \u201ccongratulations\u201d he had received on his \u201cBig Victory,\u201d presumably referring to the GOP gain of two Senate seats.) After momentarily praising bipartisan cooperation (\u201cwe can break decades of political stalemate\u201d) Trump returned to his familiar polarizing themes. He declared that he alone was confronting problems \u201cneglected by leaders of both parties over many decades\u201d; continued his criticism of the Affordable Care Act; demanded funding to build his border wall; and repeated the claim that \u201ccaravans\u201d of Central American migrants threatened the southern border, an argument Republicans and Fox News Channel had pressed during the election. He punctuated his belligerent message with a warning against \u201cridiculous partisan investigations\u201d that he said could undermine the \u201ceconomic miracle \u2026 taking place in the United States.\u201d (Trump\u2019s State of the Union in 2020 was even more bellicose, to the point where Pelosi famously ripped up her copy of it after he finished.) No one expects quite so harsh a tone from Biden. But neither do many expect him to signal as explicit a centrist course correction as Obama and Clinton did in their speeches. Biden in some ways has already started a similar process, particularly by announcing stronger measures to secure the border and many expect him to highlight those in an attempt to fortify his defenses against coming Republican attacks. And he is certain to signal his willingness to negotiate with Republicans on an array of issues, particularly reducing the deficit. But, despite his lackluster approval ratings, Biden\u2019s relatively better midterm performance has clearly left him feeling less need than Clinton or Obama for a sweeping repositioning: when asked the day after the election what he intended to change, Biden pointedly declared, \u201cnothing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be bipartisan: it\u2019s another thing to give into the Republicans, to say \u2018I\u2019m going to go along with your ideas,\u2019\u201d notes Edwards. \u201cBiden doesn\u2019t need to do that.\u201d Given his stronger position, many expect Biden to focus more than Clinton or Obama on what he will not negotiate: cutting Social Security or Medicare, attaching any budget conditions to legislation raising the debt ceiling, terminating aid to Ukraine, undoing the clean energy incentives of the Inflation Reduction Act, or accepting nationwide restrictions on abortion. \u201cWhile Joe Biden has a reputation that he would work with anyone and will make that point, everyone is more realistic about who this Republican Party is: Half of them voted to overturn [his] election,\u201d said Pfeiffer \u201cThis is as much about setting the terms for the battle to come as it is about responding to a public dissatisfaction with the sitting president.\u201d In one key respect, the experience of Biden\u2019s two recent Democratic predecessors suggests the path ahead may look the same no matter how he approaches the speech. Though both Clinton and Obama emphasized their willingness to cooperate and their determination to reduce the deficit, within months both anyway found themselves in fierce firefights with the new GOP majorities over the federal budget. No matter what Biden says on Tuesday, or the tone in which he says it, the same fate inevitably may be barreling toward him too.",

            "article_content": "The deep-pocketed network associated with billionaire Charles Koch is preparing to throw its money and weight behind a single Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential primary \u2013 in a move that could significantly reshape the GOP field. Americans for Prosperity Action, the main political arm of the Koch network, \u201cis prepared to support a candidate in the Republican presidential primary who can lead our country forward, and who can win,\u201d Emily Seidel, the CEO of Americans for Prosperity and a top adviser at AFP Action, wrote in a memo released Sunday. The memo does not mention Donald Trump, but an official with AFP Action confirmed to CNN that the network is not planning to support the former president\u2019s White House bid. Republicans elevate 'parental rights' as top issue while looking to outflank each other heading into 2024 \u201cTo write a new chapter for our county, we need to turn the page on the past,\u201d Seidel wrote to AFP\u2019s staff and activists. \u201cSo the best thing for the country would be to have a president in 2025 who represents a new chapter.\u201d The Koch decision to engage in the GOP primary \u2013 after sitting on the sidelines for the two most recent White House nomination fights \u2013 is likely to set off a scramble among Republican presidential contenders to win over the Kansas-based industrialist and the hundreds of wealthy donors who help finance his influential, free-market network. During his White House tenure, Trump, often sparred with Koch officials, who sharply criticized his administration\u2019s trade and hard-line immigration policies. AFP Action has not announced a budget for its 2024 political activity, but the network has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in previous election cycles, rivaling the financial reach of the Republican National Committee. Americans for Prosperity has permanent staff in 36 states and touts millions of grassroots activists across the country. Its political wing also plans to engage earlier and more aggressively in congressional and state-level primaries, both to influence more contests and to find new voters to participate in primaries, AFP Action officials said. Seidel said the network is stepping up its activity to help address \u201cthe broken politics\u201d that she said has created a \u201ctoxic situation\u201d in the nation\u2019s capital and blocked policy progress. \u201cThe Republican Party is nominating bad candidates who are advocating for things that go against core American principles,\u201d Seidel wrote. \u201cAnd the American people are rejecting them.\u201d Pence courts social conservatives once loyal to Trump And she cast Democrats as pushing \u201cmore and more extreme policies.\u201d Several Republicans weighing 2024 bids have longstanding ties to Koch world, including former Vice President Mike Pence. Marc Short, Pence\u2019s former chief of staff and longtime aide, once oversaw political operations at the Koch network. Another potential contender, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had the financial backing of Koch political committees when he represented Wichita \u2013 where Koch Industries is headquartered \u2013 as a congressman. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is expected to announce her bid for the Republican nomination later this month, has attended at least one Koch donor conclave. And a Koch-backed super PAC supported Ron DeSantis before he won a competitive GOP primary in 2018 on his way to becoming governor. The libertarian-leaning network has engaged in a public reset of its priorities in recent years and worked to distance itself from the Republican brand during the Trump era. But the network did back some Trump-led efforts, spending heavily, for instance, to promote his $1.5 trillion tax code overhaul in 2017 \u2013 despite clashing with the then-president and the RNC on other political and policy matters. In one sign of the network\u2019s reach, Seidel noted that AFP and AFP Action participated in more than 450 races in last year\u2019s midterms, knocked on more than 7 million doors and sent out more than 100 million mail pieces.",

            "article_content": "Florida lawmakers will return to the state Capitol in Tallahassee next week to finalize their efforts to strip the Walt Disney Company of its special governing powers, the latest round of the yearlong feud between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the entertainment giant. In addition to settling Disney\u2019s future, lawmakers in the GOP-controlled legislature will also consider changes to two other contentious DeSantis priorities \u2013 Florida\u2019s new election police force and the state\u2019s migrant transport program \u2013 to address legal concerns that have stymied their full impact, according to communications sent to members Friday afternoon by state House and Senate leaders. DeSantis proposes banning diversity and inclusion initiatives at Florida universities The flurry of action will take place in a special legislative session beginning Monday \u2013 just weeks before lawmakers were scheduled to assemble for the state\u2019s annual legislative session. Legislative leaders did not clearly explain why lawmakers were rushing to take on these matters in advance of their regularly scheduled meeting. But DeSantis has already begun to lay out an ambitious agenda for the 60-day regular session beginning in March that could serve as a platform for a potential 2024 presidential campaign announcement later this year. If all goes according to the plan from Republican leaders, it could mean a new era is forthcoming for the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the government body created in 1967 that effectively gives Disney, the state\u2019s largest employer, control over the land in and around its central Florida theme parks. DeSantis put Reedy Creek in his sights last year after Disney\u2019s then-CEO, Bob Chapek, publicly criticized a bill to restrict certain classroom instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity that the governor later signed into law. At DeSantis\u2019 demand, lawmakers voted during a special legislative session last April to dissolve Reedy Creek in June 2023. But lawmakers left town without a plan to unwind a half-century of Disney control or for how to ensure Orange and Osceola county residents wouldn\u2019t be on the hook for funding Reedy Creek services or its $1 billion in debt. Amid the fallout, Reedy Creek told its bondholders that Florida could not dissolve the district without assuming its debts. In the months since signing the bill to end Reedy Creek, DeSantis has repeatedly offered assurances that taxpayers wouldn\u2019t have to pick up the tab. Speaking at a news conference earlier this week, DeSantis said it was his intention for the state to assume control of the district. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a corporation controlling its own government; that\u2019s going to be reverted to the state,\u201d he said. \u201cDisney will not have governing self-governing status anymore. We\u2019re going to make sure that there are no special legal privileges \u2026 and then making sure they\u2019re paying their fair share of taxes and paying the debt.\u201d As of Friday afternoon, the legislative framework to accomplish that had not been filed with the state. A spokesman for DeSantis did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but House and Senate leaders said they were coordinating with the governor\u2019s office. CNN has reached out to Disney\u2019s corporate headquarters for comment. Lawsuit claims legislation used to fund DeSantis' migrant flights is unconstitutional Florida lawmakers at the special session will also consider allowing the DeSantis administration to transport migrants from anywhere in the United States, a significant expansion of a program that gained national attention last year after Florida paid for two flights that carried migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts. However, the program has stalled amid legal challenges over whether the DeSantis administration violated a state law limiting the transport to migrants from Florida. The change, if approved, could lift a significant legal hurdle that may allow the DeSantis administration to continue operating flights transporting migrants from border states to Democratic-leaning jurisdictions. The program appears to have gone dark since the September flights to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. In his budget proposal released this week, DeSantis indicated that transporting migrants continues to be a priority of his immigration agenda, allocating $12 million for its continuation into 2024. According to a letter from Florida House Speaker Paul Renner\u2019s office, the state House and Senate will consider giving DeSantis\u2019 controversial new Office of Elections Crimes and Security the jurisdiction to prosecute crimes involving elections. The proposal comes after DeSantis initiated a crackdown on voter fraud that resulted in the arrest of 20 individuals but hit a legal snag when a judge dismissed a case against a Miami defendant on the grounds that state prosecutors had acted beyond their authority. The agenda for next week will reprise some of the most attention-grabbing actions from DeSantis\u2019 first term as governor. The feud with Disney, the migrant flights to Martha\u2019s Vineyard and his new election force all thrust the Republican leader into the spotlight throughout 2022, garnering doting coverage from conservative media outlets and provoking widespread condemnation from Democrats in Florida and across the country.

            "article_content": "Congressional Democrats are betting that a coordinated offense is their best defense against the coming Republican investigative onslaught. Democrats on Capitol Hill, at the White House, in agencies and in outside political groups are gearing up to do battle with the Republican committee chairs probing all corners of the Biden administration as well as the Biden family\u2019s financial dealings. The significant effort at the outset is a sign of the danger the GOP investigations and their subpoena power pose to Biden\u2019s political prospects heading into his reelection. The stakes of knocking down the GOP probes have only grown over the past month as Biden is now grappling with a special counsel investigating his handling of classified documents found at his private residence and office. Even before the first subpoena or hearing, Democrats have enlisted polling firms and focus groups to try and undercut the coming investigations and protect Biden with the 2024 campaign approaching. Their plans include launching sustained attacks against the two Republicans expected to lead the most aggressive probes: Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio, who is also leading the new so-called weaponization of government subcommittee with a wide investigative mandate. Meanwhile, outside groups are planning to bring the fight local and visit more than a dozen Biden-leaning congressional districts to go after vulnerable Republicans involved in the investigations. At the center of the strategy will be Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whose office has already resurrected a standing investigations meeting then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had held when Democrats were in power. The meeting is intended to help staffers of different committees get on the same page with their messaging and counter-strategy. Committee aides have also been working closely to coordinate with administration officials likely to be targets of GOP subpoenas, connecting regularly to discuss plans for dealing with Republican requests for information and attacks on agencies. \u201cClearly, when they when they go off on nonsense, we\u2019re gonna push back at it,\u201d New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN. It\u2019s a strategy that in some ways mimics the way congressional Republicans served as then-President Donald Trump\u2019s attack dogs after Democrats took control of the House in 2019. Republicans villainized House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California, who led the House\u2019s first impeachment of Trump, and Trump was in constant communication with his GOP House allies during the subsequent impeachment trial. Republicans have dismissed Democrats\u2019 attempts to try to blunt their investigations. \u201cI have never seen anything like it,\u201d Comer told CNN when asked about the Democratic efforts. \u201cI have never seen an administration work so closely with outside groups to attack the investigators.\u201d Democrats will have their first public opportunity to test drive their strategy on Wednesday when the House Judiciary and Oversight committees each hold their first public hearings, one on \u201cthe Biden Border crisis\u201d and the other on abuses of pandemic spending. Aides say Democratic staff and members worked through the weekend preparing for the hearings. While the hearings themselves may be a footnote in a long saga ahead for Democrats\u2019 efforts to defend Biden, it will be an important opportunity for the party to cement themselves as being effective at countering GOP messaging. \u201cThis is a trial run,\u201d one Democratic aide said of the significance of the hearing. In interviews with more than a dozen Democratic members and staffers, they contend one of the biggest challenges going forward will be striking the right balance between sharing concerns about objectively complicated topics like dysfunction at the border and the mishandling of classified documents with their desire to play messaging defense for the President and his administration and a belief that Republicans are unfairly zeroing in on Biden on issues that were problems long before he was in office. \u201cWe obviously believe there\u2019s a very big role for oversight and making sure that government laws and programs translate for the people,\u201d Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told CNN. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that the Republicans have come to the belief that the purpose of oversight is just to harass the other side, and to engage in partisan wild goose chases. So we will be there to act as a truth squad refuting and debunking the conspiracy theories and the scandals du jour that they throw up at us.\u201d Raskin, who was a member of the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, said he and other ranking Democratic members are viewing their work through the lens of the current political environment, one that is still deeply divided two years after the attack. \u201cWe\u2019re coming out of a wrenching period of social and political conflict because of a violent insurrection unleashed against Congress and the vice president,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cFrom my perspective, Kevin McCarthy has essentially swallowed MAGA and the insurrection and they are now driving the bus over there. And our task on Oversight is to continue to defend basic Democratic institutions and legislative process the best we can against a MAGA agenda.\u201d Democrats say they\u2019re also working closely with an outside political group, the Congressional Integrity Project, which is expected to play the role of messaging clearinghouse in the coming months. Already, the group\u2019s polling on how the public perceives the GOP\u2019s broad investigations into the Biden administration has served as a guidepost for staffers as they plot their defense. Brad Woodhouse, a senior adviser for Congressional Integrity Project, said that the group will serve several functions for the Biden White House and congressional Democrats, including polling, opposition research and political events. In the leadup to the new Congress, the group sent reporters daily emails attacking Comer. On Monday, Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a manager for Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial, joined the group\u2019s press call Monday to attack the opening hearings this week for the Oversight and Judiciary committees. In addition to going after committee chairs like Comer and Jordan, the political group also says it plans to hold events in the 18 Republican-held congressional districts that Biden won, in an attempt to either turn them against the GOP investigations \u2013 or paint them with the same brush as the Republicans leading the charge against Biden. \u201cOur role is really to go on offense,\u201d Woodhouse said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost a dozen of these members in California and New York, blue states in presidential election years in districts won by Joe Biden. I\u2019m not sure they want the national conversation to be dominated by James Comer\u2019s Oversight hearings.\u201d Core to Democratic strategy is the belief Republicans will overreach in their requests into Biden, his family, his administration\u2019s decision on the border and the mishandling of classified documents \u2013 and that Democrats can seize on those moments to show a contrast to the American people between their ideology and the GOP\u2019s. \u201cIf they launch frivolous investigations, we\u2019ll point out that that\u2019s not what they ran on,\u201d Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a Democratic member of House Oversight, told CNN. \u201cIf it becomes obvious that this is singling out President Biden for a political attack, that\u2019s what the Democrats will point out. And those things tend to backfire. I mean, they backfire on both sides. If people in the country conclude that Congress is more interested in investigating than legislating, it doesn\u2019t help the party doing that.\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who was named the No. 2 Democrat on the Oversight Committee this week under Raskin, said that part of the strategy is to let Republicans go too far on their own, but she also warned that no one should interpret Democrats\u2019 strategy as a passive one. \u201cI think there is standing back, but I think there is also a little bit of casting a reel and letting them really show who they are,\u201d Ocasio Cortez said of the Democratic strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not a strategy of just stepping aside and letting the whole world see what they are doing. I think it is actually a little bit more nuanced.\u201d Already, Republicans have fired off dozens of requests for documents and testimony on a string of areas they want to investigate. In the Judiciary Committee, Republicans have also begun hinting they could move swiftly to impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, something Democrats argue would be unprecedented in the modern era with just one other secretary \u2013 William Belknap, the war secretary \u2013 impeached back in 1876 for a kickback scheme for making official appointments. Top officials in the Biden White House and agencies like the Department of Homeland Security have been preparing for months for GOP demands of documents and testimony \u2013 and the subpoenas likely to follow them \u2013 even before Republicans won control of the House. Cognizant that the border has the potential to be a political problem for Biden in his reelection, Democrats are also ramping up efforts to help educate their members. Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar, a member of both the Judiciary Committee and the House Democrats\u2019 messaging arm in House leadership, told CNN she planned to resume immigration trips for lawmakers that she led back in 2019, which led to 20 percent of House members traveling to down to the US-Mexico border. \u201cI want to make sure our members are as well versed in the realities on the ground as possible,\u201d Escobar said. In addition to the border, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s new so-called weaponization of government subcommittee is expected to have some of the fiercest fights. The panel, which was given an expanded mandate under the deal Speaker Kevin McCarthy cut with the GOP dissidents last month, is likely to target the Justice Department, FBI, social media companies and possibly more. House Democrats have yet to name their members to the panel or signal which Democrat will sit opposite Jordan at the top of the dais for what could be some of the Republicans\u2019 most high-profile hearings tied to their oversight. And in the House Oversight Committee, Comer has quickly become the House GOP point for investigating both Biden\u2019s family finances as well as the classified documents found at his former private office and Delaware residence. Democrats have responded to Comer\u2019s attacks on Biden by arguing that he could be running the same investigation against Trump \u2013 which Comer has tried to argue isn\u2019t necessary because Democrats already investigated the former president. In an early sign of how Raskin will try to rebut Comer\u2019s investigation, he requested visitor logs Tuesday in a letter to the Secret Service from the homes of Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, mimicking Comer\u2019s request last week for logs from Biden\u2019s Delaware residence. The Oversight panel\u2019s first hearing Wednesday isn\u2019t about Hunter Biden or classified documents, however, it\u2019s being held to examine abuses of federal Covid pandemic relief funding. Another factor for Raskin specifically is he\u2019ll be managing the responsibilities of his committee while receiving treatment for Lymphoma. It\u2019s something that Raskin says hasn\u2019t affected his ability to do the job so far, but if he needs them, Raskin says he has full confidence in his colleagues to do the job. \u201cI have been able to organize my chemotherapy sessions around the congressional recess calendar, so I don\u2019t need to be doing it while we\u2019re in session and I\u2019ve not missed any votes so far. And I\u2019ve not missed any meetings or hearings,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cI understand that the best skill of a captain is deploying the skills of the members of the team.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Just days into Kevin McCarthy\u2019s tenure, Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska had an issue he needed the House speaker to address. Bacon told CNN he had the impression that two bills were being fast tracked for floor votes. Neither was on the calendar officially, but Bacon was worried. One of them was a hardline border bill authored by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas that concerned some moderates because of the way it handled asylum claims. The other, the Fair Tax Act, moved to abolish the IRS and impose a hefty sales tax instead. Neither bill, Bacon argued to McCarthy\u2019s staff in a phone call last week, had the votes to pass with members of the centrist-leaning Main Street Caucus. Both, he said, could be improved with amendments and by going through the committee process. \u201cI called and said that\u2019s BS,\u201d Bacon told CNN of the idea these bills would go straight to the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s gotta go through committee just like every other bill, and I think these bills will be improved.\u201d He was assured: The bills would go through regular order. It\u2019s the kind of member management and careful tap dance that foreshadows the delicate balance ahead for GOP leadership. Their majority is narrow and divided sharply between the moderates \u2013 who hail from Biden-won districts and are the reason Republicans have the majority in the first place \u2013 and the hardliners who from the outset have asserted themselves as the ultimate deciders of McCarthy\u2019s fate as speaker. That dynamic, combined with a lengthy list of concessions McCarthy made in his quest to secure the speaker\u2019s gavel, could make it more difficult for the House GOP to pass even messaging bills \u2013 let alone essential and heavier lifts like raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit or politically dicey questions like whether to impeach President Joe Biden or a member of his Cabinet. Further complicating matters, McCarthy abolished the House\u2019s remote voting system put in place during the pandemic, making the GOP\u2019s razor-thin majority even more tenuous. Already, House Republicans are down one vote for the next few weeks with the absence of Rep. Greg Steube of Florida, who was recently injured after a fall. \u201cOur biggest challenge will be attendance,\u201d House Majority Whip Tom Emmer told CNN in an interview. \u201cPeople staying healthy and staying on the field.\u201d It\u2019s an issue Emmer is already trying to encourage members to communicate with him about early. In a closed-door meeting Wednesday, Emmer asked members for a few things he argued would help Republicans succeed in the months ahead. First, he told them, he needed to know if members had even the smallest unease with legislation before it came to the floor. Second, he asked them to trust him with their personal business. Members have families, health issues, absences and their own calendars to manage, he acknowledged during the meeting. But with a narrow margin, even a few absences can cause a calamity on the floor. Emmer said he told his conference Wednesday, \u201cWe are not in the business of discussing your business. You gotta view us as a small-town law office. Information comes in, but it doesn\u2019t go out.\u201d It\u2019s a familiar saga for any new leadership, Democratic or Republican, in which the campaign rhetoric is always harder to implement than it is to promise. Republicans were united on the trail in their messages against crime, an overrun border, out-of-control spending and an inept IRS. But the very real details of how to fix the issues now with a narrow and diverse majority that can\u2019t vote remotely anymore are already proving to be a test for leaders and the entire Republican conference \u2013 especially after McCarthy committed to a more transparent legislative process. \u201cWe all say we want regular order and the old traditional process. Well, this is what it entails,\u201d Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a member of the GOP leadership team, told CNN. \u201cIt may slow things down, but it\u2019s healthy for the institution.\u201d Emmer now finds himself smack dab in the middle of the fray. A lawmaker who cut his teeth as the director of the party\u2019s campaign arm in the last two election cycles, Emmer credits part of his ascension to leadership with the lessons he learned as a hockey coach and in the state legislature in Minnesota, often regaling his staff and members with stories from his days navigating team dynamics in a sport that is everything back home. Emmer\u2019s biggest job now: counting. It\u2019s a practice he\u2019s already become familiar with in the opening days of the 118th Congress. It was Emmer and his \u201ccheerful persistence,\u201d Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina recalled, who helped forge the negotiations between the 20 hardliners and the Speaker\u2019s office that eventually won McCarthy the gavel after 15 ballots. \u201cHe understands the political moment we are in, and he understands members and he actually is secretly a policy guy too. It\u2019s a tough job, but he has the capacity to pull people together,\u201d McHenry said. \u201cHe\u2019s quite flexible in how he responds, but he is dogged in pursuing the outcome.\u201d During the heated speaker\u2019s race, Emmer was seen as a trusted negotiator even for conservatives who were more hesitant to engage directly with McCarthy after a tense conference meeting early in the race. \u201cTom\u2019s pretty open. You kind of know where you stand right up front whether you like it or not, which is good,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, one of those 20 hardliners, told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s direct.\u201d That directness, Emmer told CNN in an interview comes from years in the state legislature where he used to shudder at messages from his more seasoned colleagues that he needed to keep his \u201cpowder dry.\u201d \u201cIn my mind, I think you get a better result when you have some tension, when you have some conflict, when you get people \u2026 you poke them until they get upset and they want to tell you something,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cToo many people in this business do not want to offend. They don\u2019t want to have that discussion and because they don\u2019t want to offend another human being, they don\u2019t tell you what they are actually thinking and what is bothering them.\u201d Emmer\u2019s philosophy is his office has to be a safe space, a place where members can come freely, early and often with their concerns, some of which he is already familiar with after shepherding them through their elections as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cHe knows a lot of these new members because he helped recruit them and helped them win their elections,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina. \u201cThat gives him a leg up.\u201d But Emmer\u2019s most challenging days are ahead with the House on a collision course with the White House on the debt ceiling and the country\u2019s financial outlook at stake. McCarthy promised he wouldn\u2019t put a clean debt ceiling bill on the floor and that any increase in the country\u2019s borrowing limit would have to come with spending cuts. What and how deep those cuts are could be yet another place where GOP disagreements take hold. While House Republicans \u2013 including those in Biden-won districts \u2013 are largely in agreement with McCarthy\u2019s position that they should demand spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, there\u2019s less consensus about where those cuts should come from or whether they should touch entitlement programs. And then there are some Republicans, such as hardline conservative Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who don\u2019t think they should raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit under any circumstances, further complicating the path forward for GOP leaders. \u201cEverybody\u2019s conservative, until it cuts their program,\u201d said South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a conservative hardliner. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see how it works out.\u201d In the opening days of the new Congress, the conference has already found itself at odds over legislation that was supposed to be the easy stuff. Bills that seemed to unite the conference in the minority were punted. One of them, legislation that would require prosecutors to report the data of crimes they chose to prosecute and not to prosecute, stalled out after conservatives raised concerns about the federal government imposing too much power in local jurisdictions. A vote on a resolution on policing also was delayed as was a vote on legislation that would have required gun shop owners to call immigration services if an immigrant residing in the US illegally tried to buy a gun. Even the House rules package, which governs how the House operates and is the first piece of legislation the chamber votes on each Congress, had become a point of contention inside the Republican conference, with some members worried about the deals McCarthy cut to become speaker. Leadership and rank-and-file members chalk up some of the early scuttles as growing pains, but not a sign of things to come. They also argue that working out the kinks before bills come to the floor will only strengthen the legislative process, even if it slows things down. \u201cBills are always better when they\u2019ve gone through committee first,\u201d McCarthy told CNN. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got a five-seat majority. When we had a 27-seat majority, we had challenges. But you can\u2019t just throw something on the floor. That\u2019s why the committee will be a better process.\u201d Others pointed out that the House GOP is only now getting up and running after being delayed by a once-in-a-century floor fight over electing McCarthy as speaker. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have rules, we didn\u2019t have committees. The single best way to avoid it is to bring stuff through regular order,\u201d Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, told CNN. \u201cI think there is a transition from the minority to the majority. When you have a three- or four-vote majority depending on attendance, you can\u2019t just bring stuff to the floor without vetting it.\u201d Rep. Tony Gonzales, who represents a swing district, ended up voting against the package, despite a behind-the-scenes effort by leadership to quell members\u2019 concerns. And the Texas Republican made clear his willingness to stand up to his own party is not limited to the rules package. \u201cI\u2019m a retired master chief and nobody knows what a retired master chief is,\u201d Gonzales told CNN, referring to his career in the Navy, \u201cbut if you do a little research on what a retired master chief is, it will be crystal clear why I\u2019m going to be a pain in the ass.\u201d Gonzales has also been an outspoken critic of the border security plan backed by Roy, which was one of the bills McCarthy promised to put on the floor in his bid to become speaker. As part of those negotiations, McCarthy also agreed to let the controversial Fair Tax Act move through \u201cregular order\u201d \u2013 in other words, letting the House Ways and Means Committee vote on it and see if it has enough support to get to the floor. But it has already lost support of at least one key lawmaker: McCarthy himself. \u201cNo,\u201d McCarthy told CNN when asked if he backs the bill. In the coming days, Republicans will face another test when they put a resolution on the House floor to remove Democratic Rep.

            "article_content": "Washington\u2019s most impossible job gets harder by the day. Attorney General Merrick Garland was already facing the grave responsibility of whether to indict a former president and current 2024 candidate depending on the results of a special counsel investigation into Donald Trump. He\u2019s now grappling with another growing political nightmare \u2013 this time courtesy of President Joe Biden\u2019s lax handling of classified documents from his time as vice president. It remains to be seen whether the attorney general can convince the public \u2013 especially conservative voters \u2013 of the fairness of the justice system with investigations targeting two presidents, especially if they reach different outcomes. Garland has spent the last two years trying to drag the Department of Justice out of the politicized quagmire into which it\u2019s been slipping ever deeper since many Democrats blamed the FBI for costing Hillary Clinton the 2016 election. He\u2019s made some progress \u2013 two separate special counsels now investigating the previous and current presidents hint at even-handedness at least. A steady procession of convictions of January 6, 2021, rioters \u2013 including against some of the highest-profile defendants Monday, such as Richard Barnett, who was famously pictured with his feet up on a desk in then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office \u2013 shows justice being done. But this has not stopped a moderate and temperate former judge from becoming a political lightning rod. The extreme pressure Trump imposed on the DOJ as he sought to use the department as a political weapon while in office has never been erased. Out of office, the former president has continued to paint any attempt to tame his excess as political bias, which has contributed to some conservatives\u2019 skepticism of the justice system. A new Republican House majority packed with Trump allies is standing up an extraordinary committee intended to find proof to back up often wild claims by Trump and conservative media that the DOJ and the FBI are little more than a huge conspiracy to bring him down. That comes as Garland confronts the most serious question facing any attorney general of the modern era: Whether to indict Trump over his hauls of classified documents and his inciting of the US Capitol insurrection. This decision could hardly be more politically dicey given the electoral context and Trump\u2019s record of moving some of his aggrieved supporters toward violence. And now, after the discovery of more classified documents at Biden\u2019s house last week in an FBI search, Garland faces another treacherous task of balancing simultaneous special counsel probes into two presidents. Even though the cases are distinct and Trump\u2019s scandal seems to include evidence of obstruction, they will eventually pose yet another fateful question for Garland and his department about the perceptions of equal justice. Garland weighed in on the question in one of his rare appearances before reporters on Monday. (Calling such a session a news conference would be a stretch since Garland frequently warns journalists in advance he\u2019s scrupulously trying to not make any comment on ongoing cases that could be considered news.) Bob Bauer: The man behind Biden's classified documents strategy \u201cWe do not have different rules for Democrats or Republicans, different rules for the powerful or powerless, different rules for the rich or for the poor. We apply the facts and the law in each case in a neutral, nonpartisan manner,\u201d Garland said. Apart from Trump and Biden\u2019s classified documents cases, the attorney general is also likely to eventually have to consider conclusions from another area probed by special counsel Jack Smith \u2013 Trump\u2019s role in attempting to steal the 2020 election and incitement of the Capitol riot, after the House January 6 committee last year recommended he be charged. But there other matters that touch Biden too. The Justice Department is overseeing an investigation into another intensely politicized figure \u2013 the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who is the central target in a GOP effort to paint their entire family as corrupt. Federal prosecutors in Delaware are weighing whether to charge the younger Biden with tax crimes and a false statement. President Biden, consistent with his vow to rebuild the invisible wall between the White House and the DOJ after the serial meddling of the Trump years, has pledged not to interfere in the case. Hunter Biden has so far not been charged with any crime. The attorney general\u2019s mantra of nonpartisan justice is consistent with the broader goal of his tenure \u2013 lifting the DOJ clear of the political mire in which it\u2019s wallowed for years and restoring its reputation for independence and nonpartisanship. But after a period in which, at various times, partisans from both sides have convinced themselves that the department and the FBI intervened in elections to harm their candidates, it also feels like a statement dating from a less turbulent age. It raises the question of how the DOJ will defend itself in a coming showdown with the new GOP House majority, which has already decided the department was \u201cweaponized\u201d against Trump and his allies by the current and past Democratic administrations. House Oversight Committee chairman sends letter requesting Secret Service provide Wilmington visitor logs The FBI and DOJ have always occupied an exposed and often politicized space in Washington. The idea that justice is blind, is not prey to partisan influences and that there is a cone of silence between the department and the White House is noble but not always observed. Unscrupulous presidents have long sought to put heavy fingers on the scale. Powerful heads of the DOJ and the FBI \u2013 most notoriously former bureau Director J. Edgar Hoover \u2013 often struck fear in the hearts of presidents. Recent years have, however, been deeply damaging for the FBI and the Justice Department. The fury of Democrats when then-FBI Director James Comey reopened the Clinton email probe days before the 2016 election still fixates liberals. Months later, President Trump was whispering in Comey\u2019s ear at a White House event and inviting him to a private dinner in an attempt to enlist his loyalty. The FBI chief sidestepped the request and was fired shortly afterward. Strong suspicions of political interference hung over the DOJ for Trump\u2019s entire tenure. When special counsel Robert Mueller delivered a report into links between Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russia, the president\u2019s handpicked attorney general, William Barr, appeared to discredit multiple possible instances of obstruction of justice. As the House January 6 committee showed, Trump sought to drag the Justice Department into his 2020 election stealing scheme, although Barr publicly infuriated him by debunking his false claims of widespread voter fraud. Any hope that Garland could quickly cleanse the political aftertaste around the department was dashed by the ever more damaging revelations about Trump\u2019s behavior on January 6, and his showdown with the National Archives over classified documents he claimed were his property at his Mar-a-Lago resort. That struggle erupted into public view \u2013 and a poisoned political arena \u2013 after an unprecedented search of an ex-president\u2019s home by the FBI. Trump accused the bureau of planting evidence and claimed he was the victim of a politicized effort to destroy his hopes of a return to the White House. Thus, he ensured that the DOJ and the FBI, like it or not, will be central players in a third straight US presidential election, likely in a way that ends up damaging their image again. One of the most detrimental aspects of Trump\u2019s legacy has been the way in which he has claimed any legal ruling or judge that goes against him is incontrovertible proof of bias. In office, his claims that judges who ruled against him on his norm breaking immigration or census policies because they were appointed by Democratic presidents drew an extraordinary rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d he said in a 2018 statement. Trump\u2019s frequent attacks on the judiciary since have come from a similar mindset. The question of whether justice is being fairly administered by Garland\u2019s department \u2013 as the DOJ brings up multiple cases and wins successive convictions at trials in Washington \u2013 was also brought up by William Shipley, one of the attorneys for Roberto Minuta, an Oath Keepers member among four men found guilty Monday of seditious conspiracy for their role in the insurrection. Shipley raised the question of whether justice could ever be fairly handed down in the city where the crimes took place. \u201cWe got a trial by residents of a small judicial district who in one way or another were almost all impacted by the events of January 6, and I think that raises some real troubling issues,\u201d Shipley said. Such issues are likely to be among the many raised by the House Judiciary Committee under new hardline Republican chairman Jim Jordan. The partisan nature of the body \u2013 and the panel probing political \u201cweaponization\u201d in the US government and intelligence agencies \u2013 will make Garland\u2019s life even more testing in the coming two years. Ironically, for a judge who was highly regarded by all his peers during years on the bench, including on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, Garland has become a hugely political figure later in his career. That was baked into his legacy ever since he was the victim of the then-GOP-controlled Senate\u2019s controversial refusal to confirm him as President Barack Obama\u2019s third Supreme Court pick in 2016. But any hopes Garland harbored when he was sworn in as attorney general of steering his department away from the partisan storm have long since been dashed. That says more about Washington and modern politics than it does about him.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of abortion rights last year deviated so much from traditional decision-making that it might have soon appeared an aberration. But now into 2023, the six conservative justices are plainly positioned to remake the law across the board. Their actions in a series of pending cases, reaching out for issues before they\u2019ve been aired in lower courts and taking precipitous steps on culture war dilemmas, demonstrate that they will continue to defy norms and the usual judicial bounds. \u201cWe are a court of law, not policymakers,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch admonished his colleagues in late December, as he dissented from the majority\u2019s latest incursion on immigration policy at the southern border. Gorsuch\u2019s words were not without some irony as he usually joins with his conservative allies moving aggressively on the law. Liberal justices had warned last June when the majority reversed Roe v. Wade that it had other precedents in its sights. \u201cNo one should be confident that this majority is done with its work,\u201d the dissenters wrote. Challenge to Harvard's use of affirmative action was designed by a conservative to reach a friendly Supreme Court The court this month is experiencing the relative quiet before the storm of its current session. It will soon begin handing down the first of its decisions for the 2022-23 term, typically saving the most difficult and consequential for later in the spring. Many of the cases the justices have accepted for the session, including the dispute over Trump-era limits on asylum claims, reflect long-held agenda items of justices on the right wing. This court, for example, seems determined to end policies that consider people\u2019s race to address shortfalls in campus diversity or gaps in voting rights. Based on oral arguments last fall, the emboldened majority is poised, in cases from Harvard and the University of North Carolina, to eliminate race-based admissions at colleges and an array of practices that have opened the door for more Blacks, Latinos and other racial minorities on campuses. Lower courts had upheld racial affirmative action, rooted in Supreme Court precedent dating to the late 1970s. No split existed in lower regional courts \u2013 the usual grounds for Supreme Court involvement \u2013 but the justices granted appeals from conservative advocates who\u2019ve asked the court to overrule the 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke and subsequent decisions upholding the use of race in admissions. The Supreme Court has also signaled a readiness to continue upending voting rights and election law, in pending cases from Alabama and North Carolina. The Alabama case centers on an essential section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that prohibits racially discriminatory redistricting maps and voting rules. Even before the court had heard the merits of the case testing the protections of that section, it restored the state legislature\u2019s map providing for only one Black-majority district among seven, despite the state\u2019s 27% Black population. A three-judge panel had said the legislative map diluted the Black vote, and the panel declared that Black voters were sufficiently numerous in the state to merit a second district. The case comes 10 years after Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a decision that gutted a separate significant section of the VRA. By a 5-4 vote, the court invalidated the provision that required states with a history of racial bias to obtain federal approval before changing electoral rules, for example, related to voter ID requirements. Supreme Court to hear challenge from ex-Postal Service worker who refused to work on Sundays The high court has also recently fortified its openness to Christian conservatives, agreeing on Friday to hear a case brought by a former mail carrier who sued the US Postal Service after being disciplined for refusing to work on Sundays. Earlier this term, the justices took up a sweeping challenge to Colorado\u2019s LGBTQ anti-discrimination law, in a case in which the law had not yet been enforced and the factual record unclear. A website designer who said she wants to design wedding sites but forgo services for same-sex weddings because of her Christian beliefs is arguing that the law broadly threatens free speech rights. Beyond rattling foundational principles, last summer\u2019s abortion ruling demonstrated the limited leadership of Roberts. He failed to persuade the five justices to his right to hold off on the reversal of a half century of abortion rights. Since then, Roberts\u2019 lack of response on court ethics issues and to questions related to a May leak of a draft ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization has only further laid bare the limits of his stewardship. Roberts said eight months ago that he was launching an investigation into the security breach, but he has been silent about what has been discovered or security fixes. Roberts had a unique opportunity to address any of the public concerns in his annual year-end report two weeks ago. He declined. For their part, the court\u2019s liberals are still working through their anguish. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, senior among the three on the left, told an audience earlier this month that the abortion decision left her \u201cshell-shocked\u201d and \u201cdeeply, deeply sad.\u201d Supreme Court conservatives seem to side with website designer who doesn't want to work with same-sex couples Her \u201csense of despair\u201d has been tempered, she said, by a desire to keep fighting and a conviction that the judicial tide will eventually turn. \u201cIt may take us time,\u201d she told an audience at the Association of American Law Schools, \u201cbut I do believe we\u2019ll go back on the right track.\u201d There are six justices on the right wing, so if one splits off \u2013 contending they are going too far \u2013 five remain. That happened in late December when conservatives, over a Gorsuch dissent, blocked a lower court decision that had declared unlawful the administration\u2019s authority to swiftly remove people crossing the southern border and seeking asylum. The high court sided with a group of Republican-led states making a last-ditch effort to join the case and challenge a lower court\u2019s rejection of the asylum practice that dated to the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic and was instituted as a public health measure, not the border control measure that the GOP states effectively seek. In March 2020, the Trump administration invoked its power under a law known as Title 42 to authorize the expulsion of migrants seeking asylum at the border, rather than allowing them to enter the country and have claims heard. The Supreme Court involvement arose after attorneys general from Arizona and 18 other states tried to intervene to keep the Title 42 authority in place. The dispute had originally been brought on behalf of families who had crossed the US-Mexico border and were subject to removal under the policy. By a 5-4 vote, the justices on December 27 acquiesced to the states and dissolved the lower court order that would have ended the practice of summarily removing people. The majority said it would decide \u2013 in arguments now scheduled for March 1 \u2013 whether the states have the authority to challenge the district court judge\u2019s order on Title 42. But the sheer blocking of the lower court action demonstrated the justices\u2019 grip on immigration policy. \u201c(I)t is hardly obvious why we should rush in to review a ruling on a motion to intervene in a case concerning emergency decrees that have outlived their shelf life,\u201d Gorsuch wrote. \u201cThe only plausible reason for stepping in at this stage that I can discern has to do with the States\u2019 second request \u2026 that they face an immigration crisis at the border and policymakers have failed to agree on adequate measures to address it. \u2026 But the current border crisis is not a COVID crisis. And courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency.\u201d As the justices rejected Biden administration pleas to stay out of the case, they reinforced a familiar pattern. The majority has been less inclined to accept Biden positions than those of former President Donald Trump on immigration. During the Trump tenure, for example, the court endorsed his travel ban for certain majority-Muslim countries, allowed funds to be transferred without congressional approval to build a border wall, and permitted restrictions on federal benefits for green-card applicants. The Biden legal team is likely to remain on the losing end of this court \u2013 a court that will easily outlast this administration even if it goes to a second term. The conservative judicial wing is relatively young. (The last three Supreme Court vacancies were caused by the retirement or death of justices in their 80s.)  On the right with Roberts, age 67, are Clarence Thomas, 74, Samuel Alito, 72, Neil Gorsuch, 55, Brett Kavanaugh, 57, and Amy Coney Barrett, 50. On the left are Sotomayor, 68, Elena Kagan, 62, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, 52. The two wings also divide along political lines: the six on the right were nominated by Republican presidents, and the three on the left, Democratic presidents. Such a neat ideological-political division is somewhat new in judicial history, as is the phenomenon that today\u2019s outcomes repeatedly align with Republican Party positions, whether on immigration and race, voting rights, or religion. And Republican appointees are likely to control the bench for decades to come. Yale Law School\u2019s Ian Ayres and Kart Kandula predicted last July that even if Democrats won five of the next seven presidential elections, the Supreme Court would still be controlled by Republican-nominated justices. They chalked the pattern of GOP dominance up to the strategic tendency of justices to retire during periods when presidents of their nominating party hold office. After examining various simulations based on presidential politics and court vacancies, they wrote in a blog post, \u201cIf Republicans more realistically have a 50% chance of winning future presidential elections, then the current Republican majority might persist beyond most of our lifetimes. We end our analysis at 50 years, but with a 50% probability of Republicans winning each presidential election, the probability that a Republican-nominated majority will persist for more than 50 years is 65%.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Senior House Republicans are moving swiftly to build a case against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as they strongly weigh launching rare impeachment proceedings against a Cabinet secretary, a plan that could generate sharp backlash from GOP moderates. Key committee chairmen are already preparing to hold hearings on the problems at the southern border, which Republicans say could serve as a prelude to an impeachment inquiry against Mayorkas. Three House committees \u2013 Oversight, Homeland Security and Judiciary \u2013 will soon hold hearings about the influx of migrants and security concerns at the border. The House Judiciary Committee, which would have jurisdiction over an impeachment resolution, is prepared to move ahead with formal proceedings if there appears to be a consensus within the GOP conference, according to a GOP source directly familiar with the matter. The first impeachment resolution introduced by House Republicans already has picked up support, including from a member of the GOP leadership team. A GOP source said the first Judiciary Committee hearing on the border could come later this month or early February. One top chairman is already sounding supportive of the move, a sign of how the idea of impeaching President Joe Biden\u2019s Cabinet secretary has moved from the fringes to the mainstream of the conference. \u201cIf anybody is a prime candidate for impeachment in this town, it\u2019s Mayorkas,\u201d Rep. James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, told CNN. It\u2019s exceedingly rare for a Cabinet secretary to be impeached, something that has only happened once in US history \u2013 when William Belknap, the secretary of war, was impeached by the House before being acquitted by the Senate in 1876. Yet it\u2019s a very real possibility now after Kevin McCarthy \u2013 as he was pushing for the votes to win the speakership \u2013 called on Mayorkas to resign or face potential impeachment proceedings. With no signs that Mayorkas is stepping aside, House Republicans are signaling they\u2019re prepared to move ahead, even as a bevy of members are uneasy about the approach. Indeed, McCarthy has to balance his base\u2019s demands for aggressive action with the concerns from more moderate members \u2013 many of whom hold seats in swing districts central to his narrow majority. And some in safer seats aren\u2019t yet sold on whether the GOP should pursue that route. How McCarthy survived the House chaos to win the speaker's gavel \u201cClearly, the management of the Southern border has been incompetent,\u201d Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Republican of South Dakota, told CNN. \u201cThat is not the threshold in the Constitution for impeachment \u2013 it\u2019s high crimes and misdemeanors. \u2026 I would want to think about the legal standard the Constitution has set out \u2013 and whether or not that\u2019s been met.\u201d If he loses more than four GOP votes on an impeachment resolution, the effort would fail in the House and could mark a huge embarrassment for the GOP leadership. Already, he has potentially lost one vote \u2013 Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas who signaled he is opposed to the effort right now \u2013 and several other members who are far from convinced that charging Mayorkas with committing a high crime and misdemeanor is warranted, even if they believe he\u2019s done a lackluster job in helping secure the southern border. \u201cHas he been totally dishonest to people? Yes. Has he failed in his job miserably? Yes,\u201d Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, said of Mayorkas. \u201cAre those grounds for impeachment? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Indeed, Republicans from swing districts are urging their colleagues to not rush into impeachment, which would be dead-on-arrival in the Senate and could turn the American people off if the party is perceived as overreaching. \u201cThe border is a disaster and a total failure by the Biden administration. We should first to try to force change through our power of the purse,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon, who represents a Biden-won district in Nebraska, told CNN. \u201cMaybe after more oversight we\u2019ll see where middle America is at, but I don\u2019t think independent, swing voters are interested in impeachments.\u201d Asked Tuesday about his pre-election warning that Mayorkas could be impeached by the House over the GOP concerns about the borders, McCarthy railed on the problems at the border. \u201cShould that person stay in their job? Well, I raised the issue they shouldn\u2019t. The thing that we can do is we can investigate, and then that investigation could lead to an impeachment inquiry,\u201d McCarthy told CNN, adding it could \u201crise to that occasion\u201d of an impeachment if Mayorkas is found to be \u201cderelict\u201d in his duties. During the first working week of their new majority, Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican, introduced articles of impeachment for Mayorkas over problems at the southern border, and Rep. Andy Biggs, a hard-right Arizona Republican, vowed to re-introduce a similar resolution in the coming weeks, which could serve as a template for eventual impeachment proceedings. Fallon\u2019s resolution says Mayorkas has \u201cundermined the operational control of our southern border and encouraged illegal immigration,\u201d also contending he lied to Congress that the border was secure. Democrats say Republicans are threatening to impeach Mayorkas for pure political reasons, and say policy disputes hardly rise to the level of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Mayorkas has already testified in front of Congress numerous times since he assumed his post, and his agency says he is fully prepared to continue complying with oversight in the GOP-led House. So far, there have been no formal requests for hearings or testimony, with congressional committees still working to get off the ground, though Republicans last year sent numerous letters and preservation requests telegraphing their plans for the majority. Biden makes tightly controlled visit to the southern border, his first as president In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mayorkas made clear he has no plans to resign and called on Congress to come together to fix the nation\u2019s immigration system. \u201cSecretary Mayorkas is proud to advance the noble mission of this Department, support its extraordinary workforce, and serve the American people. The Department will continue our work to enforce our laws and secure our border, while building a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cMembers of Congress can do better than point the finger at someone else; they should come to the table and work on solutions for our broken system and outdated laws, which they have not updated in over 40 years.\u201d Yet there are signs that the push is gaining steam in the House GOP. Fallon\u2019s resolution has attracted the support of several Republicans who previously held off on calling for impeachment, including Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican and member of the Homeland Security Committee, and Oklahoma Rep. Stephanie Bice, a new member of the GOP leadership team \u2013 signaling the idea is hardly isolated to the fringe wing of the party. Fallon, too, had not previously backed impeaching Mayorkas until this Congress. Fallon said that he introduced impeachment articles to help get \u201cthe ball rolling,\u201d but still believes it\u2019s key to show the American public why they believe Mayorkas deserves to be removed from his post. \u201cIt is important, it is an emergency, you need to break the glass, you really do need to take it up, and then we\u2019re going to have an additional investigation,\u201d Fallon told CNN. \u201cWhile that\u2019s why I filed the articles, you can always just sit on them and not do anything with them. That starts the ball rolling, we\u2019re going to give Mayorkas the opportunity to defend himself and his department.\u201d Meanwhile, key committee chairs are vowing to hold hearings on the crisis at the southern border and prepping plans to haul in officials for interviews. GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who leads the powerful House Judiciary Committee where impeachment articles would originate, suggested the issue would be one of the first hearings when his panel gets up and running. GOP leaders are cognizant of the fact they can only afford to lose four Republicans on any given vote, and want to build a thorough case for impeachment that can bring the entire party along. But pressure is already building on McCarthy, who has emboldened members of his right flank in his bid to claim the speaker\u2019s gavel \u2013 and even given them a powerful tool to call for his ouster if he doesn\u2019t listen to their demands. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and one of the key negotiators in the standoff over McCarthy\u2019s speakership and who was the first to call for Mayorkas\u2019 impeachment, told CNN: \u201cI\u2019ve been very public about my belief that he has violated his oath, that he has undermined our ability to defend our country.\u201d The primary committees that would be involved in building a case against Mayorkas are both chaired by members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus: Jordan and Tennessee Rep. Mark Green, the newly elected leader of the House Homeland Security Committee. Part of Green\u2019s pitch to become chairman has centered on how he will hold the Biden administration accountable over the southern border. Green told CNN he has a \u201cfive-phase plan\u201d to delve into the issue. \u201cAnd if it turns out that (impeachment) is necessary, we\u2019ll hand that over to Judiciary,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a fact-finding role.\u201d There\u2019s also been talk of holding field hearings at the southern border, while Republicans plan to keep making visits there, as they did in the last Congress. Jordan told reporters that the border problems will likely be one of his first hearings as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. But a source close to Jordan, who has become a close McCarthy ally, cautioned that they will not move ahead with impeachment unless the party is fully on board And it\u2019s clear that House Republicans are not yet in agreement on the issue. Freshman Rep. Mike Lawler, who represents a Biden-won district in New York, told CNN shortly before being sworn in: \u201cI think the top priority is to deal with inflation and the cost of living. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to see what we saw during the Trump administration, where Democrats just went after the President and the administration incessantly.\u201d But there are some Republicans in Biden districts already lining up behind impeachment articles for Mayorkas, suggesting the politics could be moving in the GOP\u2019s direction. Freshman Rep. Nick Langworthy, another New York Republican, is among the 26 co-sponsors who have signed on to Fallon\u2019s impeachment articles so far. And another freshman New York Republican from a swing district, Rep. Anthony D\u2019Esposito, has also expressed support for impeaching Mayorkas. D\u2019Esposito contended that many Customs and Border Protection agents are tired of the leadership from the top. Biden announces new migration programs as he prepares to visit the border on Sunday \u201cThey are the ones that will tell you flat out that Secretary Mayorkas is not living (up) to his oath and he is failing to secure our homeland,\u201d he added. And South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, also a Republican who hails from a swing district, said Mayorkas needs to go. \u201cWhen you raise your hand and take an oath to protect our country\u2019s border, and you intentionally and willfully neglect to do that job, you should lose it,\u201d said Mace, who pointed to the influx of drugs across the southern border. \u201cEither way, Secretary Mayorkas has to go.\u201d House Republicans who have long been itching to impeach Mayorkas have been trying to keep the pressure on their leadership, holding a news conference last month and urging McCarthy to more explicitly spell out where he stands on the issue before they voted him speaker. McCarthy traveled to the southern border shortly after the November election, where he called on Mayorkas to resign and threatened him with a potential impeachment inquiry, though he has not explicitly promised he would go that route. But even if an impeachment resolution is approved in the House, winning a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict Mayorkas has virtually no chance of succeeding. Some Senate Republicans, such as Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota, were noncommittal about backing such a move. And Democrats are roundly dismissing the idea. \u201cA wonderfully constructive action,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said sarcastically when asked about the impeachment talk. Coons quickly added: \u201cI think that\u2019d be an enormous waste of time.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.

            "article_content": "Dozens of House Democrats on Thursday urged US President Joe Biden not to \u201cprovide shelter\u201d for former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in the wake of an attack on Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions that echoed the January 6 attacks on the US Capitol. In their letter, the lawmakers called for the administration to reassess Bolsonaro\u2019s status in the United States and revoke his visa if necessary, and for \u201cthe Department of Justice and other relevant federal agencies to hold accountable, as appropriate, any actors based in Florida who may have financed or supported the violent crimes of January 8.\u201d \u201cWe should cooperate fully with Brazilian authorities in investigating any role Mr. Bolsonaro or those around him played in the events of January 8, and any crimes he committed when in office,\u201d wrote the lawmakers, who were led by Reps. Joaquin Castro, Gregory Meeks, Ruben Gallego, Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda and Susan Wild. Jailed Bolsonaro supporters are unrepenting in the aftermath of the January 8 riot The letter comes as Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, former January 6 committee chair, has been contacted by Brazilian officials to discuss the riots that unfolded in Brasilia last Sunday. According to a source familiar, discussions have not yet taken place, though Thompson told CNN that if the January 6 committee\u2019s work and report \u201cserves as a model for similar investigations, I will help out in any way possible.\u201d More than 1,000 people have been arrested following the attack, and the letter from the House Democrats argued that the assault in Brasilia \u201cwas built upon months of pre- and post-election fabrications by Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies claiming that the October 30 presidential election had been stolen.\u201d \u201cHis peddling of disinformation, his failure to call on supporters to accept the results of the election, and his active calls to mobilize against democratic institutions incited thousands of protestors to storm government buildings and to participate in the violent acts on January 8 against Brazil\u2019s pillars of democracy,\u201d they wrote. Bolsonaro, who departed Brazil shortly before the January 1 inauguration of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has been residing in Florida. A source familiar with his recent decision said he is considering going back to Brazil in the coming weeks to speak to the allegations made against him. Still, it is believed Bolsonaro may have entered the US on an A-1 visa, which is granted to heads of state and only valid while they are in that position. \u201cAs he is no longer the President of Brazil or currently serving as a Brazilian official, we request that you reassess his status in the country to ascertain whether there is a legal basis for his stay and revoke any such diplomatic visa he may hold,\u201d the House Democrats wrote to Biden. What Brazil lost after Bolsonaro supporters rioted in Brasilia goes beyond the destroyed buildings and relics State Department spokesperson Ned Price this week would not comment on Bolsonaro\u2019s visa status, citing privacy laws, but confirmed that if an A-1 \u201cis no longer engaged in official business on behalf of their government, it is incumbent on that visa holder to depart the US or to request a change to another immigration status within 30 days.\u201d \u201cIf an individual has no basis on which to be in the United States, an individual is subject to removal by the Department of Homeland Security,\u201d Price said at a State Department briefing Monday. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US had \u201cnot received any specific requests from Brazilian authorities\u201d regarding the Brasilia insurrection. \u201cOf course, if and when we do we\u2019ll work expeditiously to respond, as we always do,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to the White House and Department of Justice for comment on the letter. CNN\u2019s Kylie Atwood, Annie Grayer, and Michael Conte contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he did not know that government records from his time as vice president, which included some classified documents, had been taken to his private office after he had left public service. \u201cI was surprised to learn there were any government records that were taken there to that office,\u201d Biden said in response to a reporter\u2019s question at a news conference in Mexico City, where he was attending a trilateral summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada. Biden emphasized that he does not know what is in the documents that were found at a Washington, DC office that he used when he was an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania. CNN reported earlier in the day that Biden and his White House legal team do not know what\u2019s precisely contained in the classified documents because they did not review them, according to two sources familiar with the matter. CNN reported Tuesday that among the classified documents are US intelligence memos and briefing materials that covered topics including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom, according to a separate source familiar with the matter. Biden classified documents: What we know so far Biden didn\u2019t know the documents were there, and didn\u2019t become aware they were there, until his personal lawyers informed the White House counsel\u2019s office, one source familiar with the matter told CNN. In explaining why Biden doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in the documents, the source said the president\u2019s team is wary of appearing to interfere given the Justice Department is still scrutinizing the matter. The president\u2019s personal attorneys found the documents in November when packing files, the White House has said, and then the counsel\u2019s office notified the National Archives and Records Administration. Biden\u2019s lawyers provided the documents to the National Archives the day after they found them and are still cooperating in the matter being reviewed by the US attorney in Chicago, according to the White House. The president said his attorneys \u201cdid what they should have done\u201d by immediately calling the Archives. \u201cPeople know I take classified documents, classified information seriously,\u201d Biden added, saying that the documents were found in \u201ca box, locked cabinet \u2013 or at least a closet.\u201d Fewer than a dozen classified documents were found at the office, another source told CNN. It is unclear why they were taken to Biden\u2019s private office. The classified materials included some top-secret files with the \u201csensitive compartmented information\u201d designation, also known as SCI, which is used for highly sensitive information obtained from intelligence sources. Federal officeholders are required by law to relinquish official documents and classified records when their government service ends. In response to specific questions about why the Biden team did not disclose the discovery of classified documents in November at Biden\u2019s private office, Ian Sams, a spokesman for the White House counsel\u2019s office, said that they are \u201climited in what we can say\u201d now because the Justice Department is looking into the matter, and \u201cfurther details\u201d may be shared in the future. \u201cThis is an ongoing process under review by DOJ, so we are going to be limited in what we can say at this time. But we are committed to doing this the right way, and we will provide further details when and as appropriate,\u201d Sams said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. The White House has convened a call with top allies to explain the investigation surrounding the classified documents, hoping to quell the growing criticism and questions about the discovery. A White House official characterized the documents as \u201cfewer than a dozen,\u201d two people familiar with the call say, none of which are \u201cparticularly sensitive\u201d and \u201cnot of high interest to the intelligence community.\u201d No written talking points were sent to administration allies \u2013 as is often the cases during an unfolding political crisis or key moment \u2013 but the call was intended to amplify the explanation released Monday night by the White House. On the call, a top official reiterated how the president\u2019s counsel notified NARA immediately. The White House is still determining how much they can \u2013 and choose to \u2013 say about these documents, given the investigation and sensitivity. This was known to only a remarkably tight circle until news reports on Monday, aides say. As the news of the classified documents quickly consumed coverage back at home, Biden was busy kicking off a highly anticipated bilateral meeting with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, where immigration was expected to be among the top issues discussed. As the moment was unfolding, one senior administration official traveling with the president told CNN that Biden had been in meetings all afternoon ahead of the extended bilateral meeting with his counterpart. \u201cNothing has changed in his schedule,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe\u2019s focused on the summit and meeting with our closest neighbors.\u201d Exclusive: US intelligence materials related to Ukraine, Iran and UK found in Biden's private office, source tells CNN On whether advisers have discussed the issue of the classified documents during Biden\u2019s visit to Mexico so far, this official said that as far as they were aware, it had not come up. Seated to Biden\u2019s left during his meeting with the Mexican president was Attorney General Merrick Garland, who has asked the US attorney in Chicago to review the matter, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, a process that is still in a preliminary stage. The US attorney in Chicago, John Lausch Jr., was appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2017. Garland chose to have Lausch conduct the Biden documents investigation because he is one of two remaining Trump-appointed US attorneys and thus avoids the appearance of a conflict of interest because he wasn\u2019t appointed by Biden, people briefed on the matter said. Lausch has already completed the initial part of his inquiry, a source familiar with his work told CNN. He has provided his preliminary findings to Garland, the source said. That means Garland now faces a critical decision on how to proceed, including whether to open a full-blown criminal investigation. Garland was also personally involved in some of the key decision-making related to the Trump documents investigation and the decision to send the FBI to search Mar-a-Lago. The episode has echoes of the scandal that enveloped Trump in late 2021 over scores of classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida during a raid by the FBI. However, there are some key differences between the two scenarios in the Biden team\u2019s telling. Sauber said Biden\u2019s personal attorneys quickly turned over a small number of classified documents once they were found in a locked space. With Trump, when the National Archives realized key records were missing it was forced to haggle with Trump for months over the return of government documents. The documents discovered in Biden\u2019s office had never been sought or requested by NARA or any other government entity. Trump eventually gave 15 boxes of materials back to NARA. But federal investigators later came to correctly suspect that he was still holding onto dozens of additional classified files. So, DOJ prosecutors secured a grand jury subpoena and later got a judge\u2019s permission to search Mar-a-Lago, to find the documents. He is now under investigation by special counsel Jack Smith for potentially mishandling classified documents. Ever since the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago in August \u2013 a search that uncovered dozens of additional classified files \u2013 Trump has promoted wild and unfounded allegations about his predecessors\u2019 supposed mishandling of government records. The news about classified records turning up at Biden\u2019s private office is sure to provide new fodder to Trump, who has already announced his 2024 presidential bid. Trump\u2019s lawyers see the revelation of the documents in Biden\u2019s private office as a huge asset to their ongoing case related to his handling of classified documents after he left office, believing it showcases how easy it is to unknowingly take documents that are supposed to be in the possession of the federal government. While the differences in the two incidents are stark, given Trump resisted turning over the documents he took, his team plans to highlight how these documents were found days before the midterm election but nothing was said publicly about it. The news has quickly become a flashpoint on Capitol Hill for House Republicans eager to use their new oversight powers on the Biden administration. Rep. James Comer, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, told CNN he plans to press the National Archives, which his committee oversees, for information about the classified documents. \u201cPresident Biden has been very critical of President Trump mistakenly taking classified documents to the residence or wherever and now it seems he may have done the same,\u201d Comer said. \u201cHow ironic.\u201d The Kentucky Republican sent letters to the Archives and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office Tuesday night. He requested that documents and other information be turned over no later than January 24 and that NARA General Counsel Gary Stern and NARA Director of Congressional Affairs John Hamilton be made available for transcribed interviews with committee staff no later than January 17. Biden's classified documents issue adds to House Republicans' growing list of investigations House Speaker Kevin McCarthy didn\u2019t say whether he believes House Republicans should investigate Biden\u2019s retention of classified documents but said the reaction to Trump holding onto classified documents has been driven by politics. \u201cI just think it goes to prove what they tried to do to President Trump overplayed their hand on that,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been around even longer,\u201d McCarthy said of Biden\u2019s team. \u201cPresident Trump had never been in office before and had just left, came out. Here\u2019s an individual spent his last 40 years in office.\u201d McCarthy added: \u201cIt just shows that they were trying to be political with President Trump.\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight panel, pointed to what the Biden team detailed as key differences between the two instances, noting Biden\u2019s attorneys \u201cappear to have taken immediate and proper action to notify the National Archives about their discovery of a small handful of classified documents found in a locked cabinet at the Penn Biden Center so they could be returned to federal government custody.\u201d Still, some members of Biden\u2019s own party also expressed concern at the idea of classified documents being found in an improper location. Two senior Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee \u2013 Reps. Adam Schiff and Jim Himes \u2013 both told CNN that classified documents must be handled securely, offering their first reaction to news that President Biden may have mishandled classified documents from his time as vice president. Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Tuesday he expects to be briefed on the classified documents. \u201cOur system of classification exists in order to protect our most important national security secrets, and we expect to be briefed on what happened both at Mar-a-Lago and at the Biden office as part of our constitutional oversight obligations,\u201d Warner said in a statement, referring to a pending briefing that the committee is also expected to receive on Trump\u2019s retention of classified documents. The new GOP chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Turner, has sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines requesting an \u201cimmediate review and damage assessment\u201d of the classified documents. Members of the House Intelligence Committee sent Haines a similar request after classified documents were recovered from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Most of what we see on Capitol Hill is hashed out behind closed doors. But not this week. There\u2019s a slow motion, open-ended drama playing out on the floor of the House in which Republicans cannot come behind a speaker \u2013 one of the most powerful and important jobs in US government, and the prize they won with a slim House majority. And Congress can\u2019t function until it has a House speaker. Nobody knows how this will end. Catch up with CNN\u2019s live updates from the day. Lawmakers, needing to regroup after a third round of voting for a speaker, adjourned until noon Wednesday. It\u2019s a story of how 20 Republican lawmakers, despite obtaining most of their demands from Rep. Kevin McCarthy, simply will not support the man. The first two votes started with 19 holdouts, but grew to 20 in the third vote. Republican members-elect held a vote among themselves after Election Day, when a majority of the caucus picked McCarthy as their candidate for GOP leader. That put him in line to be the next speaker of the House for the Congress that was supposed to start on January 3. But the hardliners would not go along with the herd in Tuesday\u2019s vote. McCarthy\u2019s supporters \u2013 the vast majority of the Republican caucus \u2013 have so far stuck mostly together. \u201cPeople are committed to this and they\u2019re sick and tired of the tail trying to wag the dog, which is what these 19 think they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Rep. David Joyce of Ohio, who backs McCarthy, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper after the second vote. Some small cracks in McCarthy\u2019s support were starting to show in the third vote, after 4 p.m. ET, when Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida jumped camps from supporting McCarthy earlier in the day to backing Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. \u201cYou gotta close the deal,\u201d Donalds told Tapper on CNN moments before the third vote. By backing Jordan, Donalds joined the original 19, including people like Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas and Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who are equally committed. That the original 19 \u2013 far more than the four colleagues McCarthy could afford to lose \u2013 have stayed strong against him has dragged out a process that is normally a formality into a series of plodding votes the likes of which has not been seen for 100 years. McCarthy\u2019s opponents coalesced in a second round of voting behind Jordan, who used to coordinate these types of rebellions but who is now a McCarthy-backer with his eye on the chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe irony of what we\u2019re witnessing here today is the fact that Jim Jordan was always the ringleader of these types of rebellions and he\u2019s trained these guys well,\u201d said the CNN analyst, moderate Republican and former Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. \u201cNow he ostensibly is trying to get these guys to back off and they won\u2019t. And so, I mean this is the most surreal thing I think I\u2019ve seen on the House floor in all the years I have been around, because he was the quintessential rebel and he can\u2019t control them,\u201d Dent said. Republicans will ultimately figure this out and unite behind someone \u2013 McCarthy or someone else. A floor fight in 1923 took nine votes. Before the Civil War, the votes could drag on for months. Until Republicans do figure things out, the new Congress does not technically begin and Washington will be stuck. McCarthy has tried to bring his opponents on board by offering concessions to his ultraconservative colleagues, like lowering the threshold to challenge his speakership from half of Republicans to just five. It wasn\u2019t enough for the original 19 holdouts, who seem motivated by an animosity to McCarthy that not even support from former President Donald Trump could quiet. Gaetz, in nominating Jordan before the second round of voting, stood right in front of McCarthy and accused him of having \u201csold himself\u201d in the quest for the speaker post. This drama \u2013 or sideshow, if that\u2019s how you view it \u2013 does presage a very difficult year for the ultimate speaker in which the debt ceiling must be raised to avert an economic meltdown. \u201cThe Republicans have to at some point figure out what are we going to do here,\u201d said the CNN anchor John King. \u201cWe are supposed to be the governing party of the House of Representatives and we cannot come to a consensus on who should lead us. So never mind about immigration, what we\u2019re going to do about inflation, what we\u2019re going to do about the border, America\u2019s place in the world.\u201d That\u2019s all on hold until they find a leader. Meanwhile, as House Republicans grapple in a very unpredictable way with how to convince their members who have no interest in the system functioning, there will be a highly scripted photo opportunity about bipartisanship in Kentucky on Wednesday. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who just became the longest-serving Senate party leader in history, will appear with his state\u2019s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, and the country\u2019s Democratic president, Joe Biden, to announce new funding to upgrade the Brent Spence Bridge, which connects Kentucky to Ohio. There will be an Ohio Republican, Gov. Mike DeWine, and an Ohio Democrat, Sen. Sherrod Brown, also on hand. Beshear told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Tuesday that the bridge project will help the region\u2019s economy and update a key piece of infrastructure with $1.6 billion passed through Capitol Hill in 2021 in the bipartisan infrastructure bill. \u201cI think it is also a great statement that there is nothing partisan about a bridge,\u201d Beshear said. He later added the bipartisan quintet would \u201cannounce that we\u2019ve done the right thing for our people. It is pretty refreshing.\u201d Biden aims to make pushing for bipartisanship a marker of the next stretch of his presidency, and this photo op is right in that wheelhouse. \u201cIt\u2019s a giant bridge, man. It\u2019s a lot of money. It\u2019s important,\u201d Biden said of the project on Monday. He\u2019ll have to find a way to work with whomever Republicans ultimately choose to be their speaker and to find a way around the lawmakers who have no problem grinding the government to a halt.",

            "article_content": "Delia Ramirez walks toward the microphone determined to make her message heard. \u201cIt is time \u2013 it is past time that we deliver on the promise that we have made to our Dreamers,\u201d she says. On a crisp morning in early December, Ramirez is standing steps away from the US Capitol, with its white dome gleaming against the blue sky behind her. This is a rallying cry we\u2019ve heard here time and again \u2013 but Ramirez hopes when she says it, the words will carry even more weight. This isn\u2019t merely a talking point from her campaign platform. \u201cThis,\u201d the Illinois lawmaker says, \u201cis very personal for me.\u201d It\u2019s personal because if Congress doesn\u2019t act, Ramirez\u2019s husband could be among hundreds of thousands of people facing possible deportation. And it\u2019s personal because Ramirez herself is about to become a member of Congress. She\u2019s called this news conference, flanked by several of her fellow incoming freshmen lawmakers and Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, to push for members of Congress to pass several key pieces of legislation while Democrats still control the US House. Among them: the DREAM Act, which would give a possible pathway to citizenship to some 2 million undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. \u201cI am the wife of a DACA recipient. I am the daughter of Guatemalan working immigrants. I know firsthand the challenges and constant fear our families live every single day,\u201d Ramirez tells reporters. \u201cWe have to end this.\u201d That\u2019s far easier said than done, as decades of debate over immigration reform on Capitol Hill clearly show. But Ramirez says no matter how many obstacles pop up in her path, she\u2019ll keep pushing. As constant and controversial as conversations around immigration in Washington have become, many lawmakers weighing in don\u2019t have direct personal connections to the issues they\u2019re debating. Ramirez, 39, has lived them her entire life. Her mom was pregnant with her when she crossed the Rio Grande \u2013 a detail Ramirez made a point to include in a candidate bio on her campaign website, which notes that her mom went on to work \u201cmultiple low-wage jobs to give her children a fighting chance to escape poverty.\u201d Ramirez says over the years some of her political opponents have tried to use details like this from her background against her, accusing her of being in favor of open borders and speaking dismissively about her family during debates. But Ramirez sees her family\u2019s story as a strength that\u2019s helped her connect with voters and better understand the issues that matter to her constituents. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to shy away from the fact that I\u2019m working class and my husband\u2019s a DACA recipient, that I\u2019m worried about how I\u2019m going to pay for housing. That is the reality of so many people,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I want men and women, young and old, to see me and think, \u2018That was my m\u2019hija, That was my daughter.\u2019 Or\u2026\u2019I\u2019m an intern somewhere and I don\u2019t feel seen. But if she could do it, so can I.\u2019\u201d Ramirez says the story of her mom\u2019s journey from Guatemala to the United States infused her childhood in Chicago, where Ramirez was born. According to the story Ramirez grew up hearing, when her mom crossed the Rio Grande, strong currents nearly swept her away. She\u2019d hidden her pregnancy from others on the journey, but in that moment she called out in desperation, \u201cHelp! Help! Save me! Save my daughter!\u201d A man did, Ramirez says, but after that day, her mom never saw him again. As she struggled with depression as a teenager, Ramirez says her mom would frequently invoke this part of her past, saying, \u201cI nearly died so that you could be born. Now I have to fight to keep you alive.\u201d That struggling teen, Ramirez says, would never have imagined that she\u2019d run a homeless shelter and other successful nonprofits, go on to become a state lawmaker and one day be on the cusp of entering US Congress. \u201cBut that is the journey, right?\u201d Ramirez says. \u201cMaybe not the Congress part as often as it should be, but the journey of so many people and so many children of immigrants who contribute and do so much for this country.\u201d How does her family\u2019s journey shape her view of what\u2019s unfolding now at the border? \u201cI am clear that anyone willing to risk dying, starving or even being raped in the long journey through desert, cold and tunnels is crossing because they feel like there is no other solution to their situation.  Their migration is the only way they see themselves and loved ones surviving deep poverty and, in some cases, persecution,\u201d Ramirez says. \u201cMy mother wouldn\u2019t have risked my life or hers had it not been the only option she saw for her unborn child to have a chance at a life and childhood better than hers.\u201d As Ramirez shares these and other details from her past with CNN in the Longworth House Office Building one evening in early December, an aide steps in with her phone in hand. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he tells her. Ramirez is still an Illinois state legislator for a few more weeks, and she needs to vote on a measure that might not pass if she doesn\u2019t. She holds the phone in one hand and looks into the camera. \u201cRepresentative Ramirez votes yes,\u201d she says, then hands the phone back to her aide. \u201cDone,\u201d she says with a triumphant smile. It\u2019s the latest in numerous bills Ramirez has helped pass since her 2018 election to the Illinois General Assembly. In that way alone, she knows it will be an adjustment to work as a lawmaker in Washington, where partisan fights often get in the way of passing laws. She still remembers the first state bill she sponsored that passed in March 2019 \u2013 a measure to expand homelessness prevention programming, a top concern for Ramirez, who previously directed a homeless shelter. \u201cIt was a very emotional moment,\u201d she says. And the first thing she did after the bill passed, she says, was call her mom and share the news. \u201cI said, \u2018Mom, in three months I was able to do more (to prevent homelessness) than I had done in almost 15 years,\u2019\u201d Ramirez recalls. Her mom responded that she was proud but reminded Ramirez that her work wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cGo hang up, and do more,\u201d she said, according to Ramirez. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget where you come from.\u201d It\u2019s with that mantra in mind, and with memories of growing up as the daughter of immigrants who worked multiple jobs to support their family in Chicago, that Ramirez is heading to Washington. Both her parents are US citizens now, but Ramirez says they\u2019re still struggling to make ends meet. \u201cI am the daughter of a woman who at 61 has given so much to this country and is a minimum-wage worker that can\u2019t afford health care, so she\u2019s on Medicaid, and diabetic,\u201d Ramirez says. \u201cI am the daughter of a man who spent 30 years working in an industrial bakery, a union busting company, and the day he retired, he got a frozen pie. He didn\u2019t get a retirement pension and he struggled with Medicare supplemental, covering the cost.\u201d Ramirez\u2019s newly redrawn Illinois congressional district is nearly 50% Latino and heavily Democratic, spanning from Chicago\u2019s Northwest side into the suburbs, according to CNN affiliate WLS. She won more than 66% of the vote in the general election, defeating Republican mortgage company executive Justin Burau. After Ramirez\u2019s election, her background landed her on many lists of firsts. She will be the first Latina elected to Congress from the Midwest. She\u2019s also helped set another record as part of the largest number of Latinos ever in the House of Representatives. There\u2019s another notable detail about her background that Ramirez has pointed to regularly in interviews since her election: She has a \u201cmixed-status family.\u201d More than 22 million people in the United States live in mixed-status families, according to immigrant advocacy group fwd.us, meaning at least one family member is an undocumented immigrant and others are US citizens, green card holders or other lawful temporary immigrants. But it\u2019s rare to hear a member of Congress use the term to describe themselves. Because of her family\u2019s experience, Ramirez knows many of the people who supported her candidacy see her as a voice who will speak out for them, and for so many immigrants who are in the shadows and rarely heard. Ramirez married Boris Hernandez in October 2020. They met earlier that year in what she describes as \u201cone of those pandemic loves.\u201d She\u2019s best friends with his cousin. Hernandez is originally from the same town in Guatemala as her parents. He came to the United States when he was 14. And for years, like hundreds of thousands of other people, he\u2019s relied on the Obama-era program known as DACA, short for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which granted certain young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children work permits and protection from deportation. On her campaign website and social media feeds, Ramirez has shared photos of Hernandez. And she\u2019s invoked her husband\u2019s story in recent speeches and conversations with constituents. Hernandez often stood by her side at campaign events. He occasionally took photos, too (he\u2019s a photographer, in addition to also having worked in nonprofits and early childhood development). He accompanied Ramirez as she voted on Election Day, even though he couldn\u2019t cast a ballot. Ramirez acknowledges that she\u2019s privileged compared to many loved ones of DACA recipients. She\u2019s a US citizen, and because of that, Hernandez has a pathway to citizenship no matter what Congress decides. But still, she says, they could end up in a precarious position. If a federal judge\u2019s ruling ends DACA \u2013 something many immigrant rights advocates warn is likely to happen in the next year \u2013 and her husband\u2019s paperwork to adjust his immigration status is pending, Ramirez knows she could have a lot more to worry about in addition to her busy schedule as a first-term congresswoman. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fighting to keep my husband here,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019m a member of Congress. \u2026. What happens to the other 2 million (undocumented immigrants that the DREAM Act would protect)? What happens to his brother? What happens to my best friend from high school? What happens to all of them who have no pathway, who don\u2019t have a citizen husband or wife or partner?\u201d Ramirez says that question keeps her up at night. Standing beside Ramirez outside the Capitol on that morning in December, Congressman-elect Robert Garcia of California praises her for bringing the group of freshmen lawmakers together even before they\u2019ve taken office. \u201cShe\u2019s been leading on issues of immigration, on DACA for Dreamers, to ensure that our country\u2019s taking care of those who really need our help,\u201d Garcia says. Helping Dreamers isn\u2019t the only topic on the agenda during this December news conference; Ramirez and the others are also pushing for extensions to the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, and more funding for early childhood education programs. In her interview with CNN, Ramirez said her plans to fight for policies that help immigrants extend beyond immigration reform. One key issue she wants to work on while in office: housing, an area that she says is critically important to immigrant families and working-class families in general. The progressive policies she champions, she says, would benefit immigrants and US citizens alike. \u201cIt\u2019s an \u2018and,\u2019\u201d she says, \u201cnot an \u2018or.\u2019\u201d Ramirez\u2019s voice cracks with emotion as the news conference ends and she makes her closing argument. \u201cIt is time to deliver for our Dreamers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is time for Boris Hernandez to finally have a pathway to citizenship.\u201d Ramirez says she feels overwhelmed by gratitude that her constituents have given her this chance to represent them, and a strong sense of urgency to deliver the results she knows so many people desperately need. Weeks later, the 117th Congress adjourned without taking most of the steps Ramirez and her fellow incoming freshmen had been pushing for. And with the balance of power shifting, she knows the battles to come will be even tougher. But for Ramirez, the words she proudly proclaimed in that first news conference outside the Capitol still hold true. She and other new members of the House Progressive Caucus have only just begun to make their voices heard. \u201cWe\u2019re rooted,\u201d she says, \u201cand we are ready to help with this fight. \u2026 Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d",

He is also a former senior policy adviser to Congress\u2019 Joint Economic Committee. Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed in this piece are his own. View more opinion on CNN. History, as we know, never fully repeats itself, but it can sometimes rhyme a little. And a few surface-level parallels between President Joe Biden and his Democratic predecessor in the 1990s suggest some perils for Republicans expecting a primrose path to the White House in 2024. Many in the GOP see Biden as politically vulnerable, suffering from what they see as unpopular cultural baggage, high inflation and the undeniable fact he will be pursuing reelection as the nation\u2019s first president over 80. But they look past his recent shift toward the center at their peril. Ever since last month\u2019s State of the Union, the Biden administration has been taking intentional steps to appeal to moderate voters. In doing so, it is echoing the successful path walked by President Bill Clinton on his way to reelection in 1996. Clinton started his time in office stumbling over hot-button social issues, attempting an ill-fated health care reform proposal and signing a crime bill that divided his party and energized his opponents. Stung by a historic congressional loss in the 1994 midterms, Clinton famously started encroaching on traditional Republican issues, talking about the need to reform welfare, reducing the budget deficit and declaring \u201cthe era of big government\u201d over. In addition to this strategy of triangulation, Clinton outlined a series of small-ball but popular cultural initiatives aimed at capturing people\u2019s attention: He endorsed school uniforms, endorsed a V-chip that purported to block violence on TV, asked for a national pledge to end violence against women and pursued a campaign against teen pregnancy. Biden\u2019s political fortunes aren\u2019t as dire as Clinton\u2019s were in 1995. He has racked up meaningful bipartisan wins on infrastructure, gun safety and semiconductor manufacturing, and advanced progressive priorities like health care and green energy spending. His party\u2019s unexpected success in the midterms also gave him some political wiggle room. But he, too, has markedly, if less ostentatiously, tacked toward the center to prepare for an impending reelection bid. From issue to issue, the Biden White House is preparing for the upcoming campaign by creating some daylight between its stance and the progressive left. Opinion: Biden's smart political move angers progressives Most notably, Biden\u2019s announcement last week that he would not veto Republican-led legislation to rescind a controversial Washington, DC, crime law was clearly intended to take a tough-on-crime stance. On immigration, the White House has angered immigration activists by remaining open to reinstituting some of the Trump-era policies they once decried \u2014 including the detention of migrant families that cross the border illegally. Biden even backtracked on his 2020 campaign pledge to not permit new fracking on federal land. While this annoyed climate groups, it demonstrated that he recognized the need for, in the words of Washington Monthly\u2019s Bill Scher, \u201ca pragmatic attitude\u201d toward keeping America\u2019s energy supply secure. In some ways, Biden isn\u2019t so much homing in on Republican turf as he is reclaiming ground Democrats had quietly ceded in recent decades. Requiring federal infrastructure projects to \u201cBuy American,\u201d while economically questionable, is the type of policy that could make inroads among blue-collar voters, who have trended rightward. Boasting, as Biden did last December, about how many jobs for workers without a college degree his administration\u2019s legislative packages will create is a strong rhetorical tack. As The Atlantic\u2019s Ron Brownstein has written, the president\u2019s focus on blue-collar work harkens back to an older tradition among Democrats and \u201cseparates Biden from the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\u201d At the same time, Biden has prioritized some Clinton-esque quality of life issues that could appeal to political agnostics, such as strong-arming airlines into letting families sit together and encouraging Congress to take action to protect kids\u2019 privacy online. This is the dynamic that could decide the 2024 GOP race It\u2019s a mix of big-picture rhetorical shifts and smaller, tangible initiatives \u2014 a close cousin to Clinton\u2019s successful triangulation in the mid-1990s. And it should make Republicans think a little harder about how they might campaign against a second Biden term in next year\u2019s general election. Republicans will likely turn to some familiar tools in the playbook. Congressional Republicans will hold hearings into Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings and anything else that has the whiff of scandal. They will continue to make hay with any steps that suggest the administration is beholden to activists outside of the ideological mainstream, like replacing \u201cmothers\u201d with \u201cbirthing person\u201d in federal documents. And they will continue to slowly ratchet up the rhetoric around Ukraine, trying to find fault with the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the war as it grinds into its second year. But the tried-and-true messaging that excites the base will not be sufficient to combat Biden\u2019s political pivot to the center. And on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump is promising to be \u201cretribution\u201d against the \u201cDeep State,\u201d overshadowing his more creative and laudable policies like new cities and baby bonuses. To muster an effective response, Republicans need not and should not be afraid to counter with their own proactive agenda. If Biden is going to propose popular, even populist, economic policies like infrastructure spending and curbing \u201cjunk fees,\u201d the GOP should prioritize politically-salient issues of their own. A strong federal effort to give families more tools to keep their kids safe online would resonate with a majority of parents across the political aisle. Committing to extending or improving the Child Tax Credit would give parents peace of mind and a positive reason to vote for Republicans.  In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has proposed eliminating sales taxes on baby supplies, diapers, wipes and strollers, and states with Republican legislatures, like Texas and Georgia, are contemplating similar bills. Those are the type of visible, tangible policies that can connect with voters\u2019 values and their pocketbooks. Trump\u2019s futuristic agenda, if it could be plausibly spelled out in detail, offers another forward-looking approach. Republicans in the mid-1990s thought Clinton was up against the ropes, only to see him recover and win convincingly. Those who expect Biden to fade quietly may be similarly disappointed. Pointing out the flaws in the White House\u2019s agenda and priorities is the basic blocking and tackling of politics. To truly make a play for independent and moderate voters, the GOP will need to develop a policy agenda that similarly goes on the offensive.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. It was 10 years ago that \u201cFlorida Man\u201d emerged as a buzzy Twitter account documenting outlandish headlines from the Sunshine State, but the meme can be traced back to the 1500s, during the days of Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u2019s supposed quest for the fountain of youth in Florida. In the Washington Post last year, Julio Cap\u00f3 Jr. and Tyler Gillespie tracked the origins of the meme through centuries of colonial and state history, and concluded, \u201cThe internet turned Florida Man into a Southern Gothic figure of indulgence, decadence and questionable decisions.\u201d With the 2024 presidential campaign about to ramp up, Republicans are facing the prospect of having two Florida men as frontrunners. One is the former president, Donald Trump, who despite two impeachments and a sea of legal troubles, still retains a strong hold on the party\u2019s base from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and vowed Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference to be the agent of \u201cretribution\u201d on behalf of aggrieved voters. The other is the state\u2019s culture-warring governor, Ron DeSantis, the so-far undeclared candidate who grew up on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. He is talking up his new book and winning the support of many wealthy donors as early polls show he is the strongest Republican challenger to Trump. Trump has road-tested a variety of derogatory nicknames for DeSantis, while the governor has only pushed back obliquely. Yet within their party, Trump and DeSantis are aligned \u2014 and at the opposite end of the ideological spectrum from yet another Florida man, former Gov. Jeb Bush, who was the early leader of the Republican field for 2016. \u201cIn this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand,\u201d DeSantis declares in his book, sounding a note that Trump could well agree with. The governor, fresh from his battle with Disney, implied that he is best suited to oppose \u201clarge, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes.\u201d At CPAC, Trump said, the GOP is \u201cnever going back to the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove and Jeb Bush.\u201d How did DeSantis rise to potentially challenge Trump? Justin Sayfie, a former adviser to Jeb Bush and partner at a lobbying firm, attributes \u201chis rapid national ascent\u201d to \u201cthe early pandemic in 2020 when he became a hero to millions for filling a vacuum of leadership at a time of global crisis and uncertainty.\u201d \u201cVulnerable older adults in Florida witnessed how he prioritized their health and safety by prohibiting transfers of patients infected with the coronavirus from hospitals into long-term care facilities, unlike in New York,\u201d Sayfie wrote. \u201cParents of Florida schoolchildren witnessed how he focused on keeping schools open, so students wouldn\u2019t fall behind in their learning. Small-business owners witnessed how he battled to get and keep businesses open, so they and their employees could continue to feed their families during the pandemic.\u201d And the flood of tourists to Florida took note. Moreover, DeSantis has a knack for picking issues that unite Republicans and divide Democrats, Sayfie observed. Reading the governor\u2019s new book, Jay Parini noted that \u201ceverywhere \u2026 one senses his rage against political correctness. He rails, on nearly every page, about \u2018the woke agenda\u2019 that he sees permeating almost every level of life in America\u2026\u201d \u201cThe title of this book must surely be ironic: \u2018The Courage to Be Free.\u2019 DeSantis is all about the restriction of freedoms wherever possible. He wants to cancel librarians who allow kids to read certain Black or LGBTQ writers and to fire tenured professors in the state university system who teach \u2018woke\u2019 ideas. He wants to restrict the rights of women seeking abortions and those of LGBTQ people seeking to live their lives. He hopes to punish corporations, such as the Walt Disney Company, for criticizing his policies.\u201d  In Parini\u2019s view, DeSantis is \u201ca chilly man, with a heart of ice and \u2014 like so many politicians on both the right and left these days \u2014 full of resentments, grudges and the urge to destroy anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with him. \u2026 I shudder to think what he might do if handed the presidential bully pulpit.\u201d The first primaries won\u2019t start until early next year, so there\u2019s still plenty of time for GOP contenders from states other than Florida to jostle for the nomination.

In the day-to-day swirl of life, adults may set those queries aside, but they remain front of mind for many children. This weekend, CNN Opinion launched the first in a series of videos featuring questions from kids and answers from some of the world\u2019s foremost experts. In a collaboration with the Templeton Foundation, CNN\u2019s Kirsi Goldynia and Mackenzie Happe produced a video in which Anthea, a 9-year-old Brooklyn student, asked theoretical physicist Brian Greene, \u201cWhat existed before the universe?\u201d We hope you\u2019ll watch Greene\u2019s reply \u2014 and let us know what you think. \u201cStudent loan debt is crushing, and it has exploded in the last few decades,\u201d observed Jill Filipovic. Many of the more than 43 million Americans who collectively owe $1.75 trillion dollars cheered when President Joe Biden announced a plan to forgive as much as $20,000 per borrower. But six Republican-led states and two debt holders have filed lawsuits challenging the policy, claiming it\u2019s \u201cbeyond the scope of Biden\u2019s power; he\u2019s using Covid as a pretext, they say, for a law that should be approved by Congress,\u201d Filipovic noted. Supreme Court justices heard arguments in the case Tuesday. \u201cThe Republican talking point,\u201d she added \u201cis that Biden\u2019s plan is a massive taxpayer giveaway, and that he cunningly used Covid as an excuse to push through a policy Congress would have never approved. So it\u2019s worth asking Republican politicians: Why won\u2019t Congress act to relieve student loan debt \u2014 even if it means making the uber-wealthy and large corporations pay more in taxes \u2014 and improve the economic and personal futures of so many young people?\u201d The US Department of Energy lent new credibility to the theory that the virus that causes Covid-19 accidentally leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, saying last week that it has \u201clow confidence\u201d in that assessment. Then FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency thinks the pandemic \u201cmost likely\u201d resulted from a \u201cpotential lab incident in Wuhan.\u201d Peter Bergen noted that \u201cwe may never truly know how the Covid-19 virus originated because the Chinese government didn\u2019t allow international inspectors into Wuhan for weeks after a new mysterious, lethal virus first emerged there in December 2019.\u201d Covid has killed 6.8 million people, including 1.1 million Americans. \u201cAnd yet the United States hasn\u2019t had any systematic examination by the government of how this happened,\u201d Bergen wrote. A \u201cCovid-19 commission must be formed to investigate how the virus emerged, which responses to the virus worked or didn\u2019t work as it spread across the United States and the lessons learned for how best to prepare for the next pandemic.\u201d The release of Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch\u2019s deposition in a legal filing as part of a lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems has ignited a new debate over the role of Fox News. \u201cMurdoch acknowledged that some Fox News hosts \u2014 Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo and former host Lou Dobbs \u2014 endorsed lies that the 2020 presidential election was stolen; and that he gave Jared Kushner confidential information about President Joe Biden\u2019s ads and debate strategy in 2020,\u201d David Zurawik noted. \u201cMurdoch\u2019s deposition clearly shows the hypocrisy, dishonesty and lack of anything resembling journalistic ethics at the top and in front of the camera at Fox News.\u201d Zurawik considered how this will affect the network\u2019s future, writing, \u201cFor one thing, Fox was never a news network to begin with. Whereas a news network is a platform built on the premise that one of its first obligations is providing citizens with vetted information that they can use to be free and self-governing, Fox was founded in 1996 as a political platform and run by Roger Ailes, a political operative.\u201d Now, Zurawik argued, \u201cIt\u2019s become so much deeper culturally. Fox News is a world view, a lifestyle, a way of seeing the world, a 24/7 warm bath of false nostalgia and aggrievement primarily for older adults \u2014 some of whom are likely feeling left behind or threatened by the changes in American life.\u201d Four years ago, Lori Lightfoot won nearly 74% of the vote for Chicago\u2019s mayor. On Tuesday, she failed to advance to the runoff, having gained the support of just 17% of voters, David Axelrod pointed out. \u201cCrime \u2014 a perennial issue that has bedeviled mayors for decades \u2014 is far and away the top concern of Chicago voters. And while she could claim some progress in the past year over 2021, Lightfoot was widely considered a failure on the critical issue of public safety,\u201d Axelrod wrote. But there were other issues. \u201cLightfoot\u2019s fall is a more complicated story that goes to a clenched-fist, go-it-alone style of leadership that made consensus hard to build and drove many who should have been her allies away.\u201d How\u2019s your Sunday going? According to TikTok creator Marisa Jo Mayes, many people spend the day putting together \u201cinsanely long to-do lists\u201d and feeling \u201cparalyzing\u201d pressure to get things ready for the start of the work week. \u201cAs a result,\u201d Holly Thomas wrote, \u201cwe hit Mondays primed for stress and unable to focus or engage properly with work. This sense of chaotic unease ripples across the week, costing us more in terms of productivity and vitality than any amount of effort can compensate for. Bare minimum Monday devotees instead make the conscious decision to coast on the first day of the working week, thus conserving their energy. \u2018It was like some magic spell came over me,\u2019 Mayes explains. \u2018I felt better. I wasn\u2019t overwhelmed, and I actually got more done than I expected.\u2019\u201d As a millennial, Thomas feels for Mayes and other GenZers grasping for solutions to overwork. \u201cThe first several years of my working life passed in a haze of fluorescent office light and breakfasts consumed any time between 4 and 10 am consisting entirely of caffeine pills, Pepsi Max and coffee. I made less money each month than I\u2019d be charged in rent a decade later and conducted my business and relationships in a permanent state of adrenalized exhaustion. \u2026\u201d \u201cUnlike millennials, who were at least motivated by the hope that it would all be worth it in the end, there\u2019s no such light on the horizon for Gen Z.\u201d Newspapers across the country announced they would stop running \u201cDilbert\u201d after the comic strip\u2019s creator Scott Adams ranted about Black Americans as a \u201chate group\u201d and told White people to \u201cget the hell away\u201d from them. Adams complained he was being cancelled, but, as Dean Obeidallah wrote, \u201cthis is not \u2018cancel culture,\u2019 but \u2018consequence culture\u2019 where people are rightly held accountable for their words and actions\u2026\u201d \u201cAdams is just a prime example of the era we live in, a time when some people will say racist or bigoted remarks and then play the victim card, alleging that they have been victimized by \u2018cancel culture\u2019 in hopes of silencing their critics.\u201d \u201cIn the minds of people like him, freedom of expression means being free to spew all the hate-filled garbage they want and in response, requiring the rest of us to bite our tongues. But that\u2019s not how free speech works. People will and should push back against bigotry.\u201d Winning the NCAA individual all-around title in gymnastics left Onnie Willis Rogers \u201celated\u201d two decades ago. \u201cBut it was a particular kind of joy, tinged with the frustration often felt by the Black athlete who excels in a sport where they are one of only a very few.\u201d \u201cEven during my four years at UCLA, an urban school with a sizable Black population, I was the only Black female gymnast on my team,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I\u2019ve noticed something different about gymnasts today, and perhaps you have, as well. There are more Black and brown athletes in the sport than ever before. And they are turning out to be a force to be reckoned with\u2026\u201d \u201cThis year, Fisk University is the first HBCU to have an NCAA gymnastics team \u2014 an entire team of Black and brown girls doing gymnastics. It\u2019s radical. It\u2019s transformative. And as Black History Month draws to a close, it\u2019s a reminder of what is possible.\u201d For more: Julian Zelizer: Uncovering the forgotten history of slavery in the North Peniel E. Joseph: This enduring crime continues to haunt America\u2019s efforts for racial justice The actor Thomas Sadoski recently returned from a trip to war-torn Yemen, in conjunction with his work for the humanitarian organization War Child. He wrote that malnutrition affects as many at 95% of children in some areas. \u201cThe resulting stunted physical development had me convinced that I was in a kindergarten classroom when in fact I was meeting with eight and nine-year-olds. And those children were, as a colleague unnervingly put it, \u2018the lucky ones.\u2019 Over 2 million Yemeni children are not in school, with far too many of them populating the vast child soldiery one must daily maneuver.\u201d \u201cEverywhere is the ache of terminal starvation \u2014 the nightmarish effects of which include the inability to regulate body temperature, to produce tears when weeping and then a final decline into ghastly, emaciated, lethargic death. All of which I saw, and which Yemenis endure daily: children\u2019s lives snuffed out by globally sanctioned neglect.\u201d Against this backdrop, Sadoski wrote, \u201cTo stand callously by and watch indignity lumped upon depravity heaped upon agony is utterly inhuman. Nevertheless, the wheels are steadily in motion for that outcome, as global aid for Yemen is in staggering decline.\u201d Frida Ghitis: The toxic brew poisoning American society Sara Stewart: \u2018Cocaine Bear\u2019 may actually be a game changer Q&A with Odessa Rae: How Putin\u2019s nemesis finds humor even in the darkness Marion Messmer: The other nuclear threat you might have missed from Putin\u2019s speech Candace Rondeaux: The higher Wagner\u2019s notorious boss rises, the harder he may fall Tom Vilsack: How the USDA plans to protect families losing SNAP pandemic benefits AND\u2026 Jeff Yang is closer to Physical zero than 100, but he\u2019s still hooked on \u201cPhysical 100,\u201d the Netflix reality show from South Korea. \u201cDespite claiming to be a search to find the ultimate physical specimen,\u201d he noted, the show was \u201cwas more of an acknowledgment that no such single ideal exists; that different types of bodies excel at different types of achievement, and that all kinds of builds deserve respect.\u201d \u201cLosers cheered on survivors; winners reached their hands out to help up the fallen; and the symbolic act of trying your hardest delivered the only real victory that matters \u2014 victory over fear and self-doubt.\u201d \u201cAs another fan-favorite contestant, 47-year-old MMA fighter Choo Sung-hoon, said after losing in the semifinal round, \u2018I wanted to prove that people in their 40s and 50s around the world, like me, can beat young people if they work hard.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Justin Sayfie has served in the administration of three Republican presidents and was a top adviser to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Sayfie is a partner at the lobbying firm of Ballard Partners and publisher of SayfieReview.com, a website on Florida politics. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. The 2018 midterm elections were terrible for the Republican Party. The GOP lost 41 seats in the House of Representatives, and Democrats beat GOP candidates by more than 10 million votes \u2014 the largest raw vote margin in a House midterm election ever. Democrats also gained seven governorships that year. Despite those anti-Republican hurricane-force headwinds, Republican Ron DeSantis beat Democrat Andrew Gillum in the Florida governor\u2019s race by 0.4%, or roughly 32,000 votes out of more than 8 million votes cast. In the 2022 midterm elections, the anticipated bright-red \u201ctsunami\u201d evaporated into a colorless mist. Yet DeSantis scored an unprecedented victory for a Republican in Florida, beating his Democratic opponent by more than 19 percentage points and 1.5 million votes. When Republicans were asked who they would like to see as their party\u2019s nominee for 2024, a recent Monmouth University national poll showed DeSantis even with former President Donald Trump in a hypothetical field of seven and ahead of him in a direct head-to-head matchup. A Quinnipiac University poll found a near even race between Biden and Trump, with 48% supporting Biden and 46% supporting Trump, and a close race between DeSantis and Biden, with 47% supporting DeSantis and 46% supporting Biden. How has DeSantis gone from narrowly escaping defeat in 2018 to now becoming a formidable prospective contender for the White House? His rapid national ascent began during the early pandemic in 2020 when he became a hero to millions for filling a vacuum of leadership at a time of global crisis and uncertainty. Vulnerable older adults in Florida witnessed how he prioritized their health and safety by prohibiting transfers of patients infected with the coronavirus from hospitals into long-term care facilities, unlike in New York. Parents of Florida schoolchildren witnessed how he focused on keeping schools open, so students wouldn\u2019t fall behind in their learning. Small-business owners witnessed how he battled to get and keep businesses open, so they and their employees could continue to feed their families during the pandemic. Being the governor of tourism-rich Florida meant that voters within the state were not the only ones who noticed or benefited from DeSantis\u2019 pandemic leadership. Florida counted about 200 million visitors in 2020 and 2021. When visiting Florida, millions of domestic tourists experienced Florida\u2019s openness and returned home having personally experienced the benefits of DeSantis\u2019 leadership. Opinion: Ron DeSantis' new book offers a powerful warning to the US electorate DeSantis\u2019 governance style during the pandemic not only earned him respect from many around the country, but it also became a weathered template for other battles he has fought. Here is the recipe for DeSantis\u2019 political success: Step 1: Take decisive action. This step follows a counterintuitive political principle that DeSantis gets: It\u2019s more important for a leader to be decisive than for the decision itself to be popular. Voters do not want weathervanes for leaders. They appreciate a leader who takes bold action and gets things done much more than someone who constantly puts a finger in the wind, unsure of which direction to move next. Step 2:  When possible, take your most decisive actions on issues that unite Republicans, divide Democrats and appeal to independents. Step 3: Hope to be condemned by major news media outlets or scorned by elites in Hollywood or university faculty lounges. Step 4: Stand your ground. Do not back down. DeSantis\u2019 decisions on Covid-19 are prime examples of how this recipe worked. He was decisive, even when public opinion started out against him. He was criticized in news reports and by editorial boards, public health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2013 then the nation\u2019s highest ranking government official on infectious disease \u2013 and by Biden. Yet instead of hurting him politically, these criticisms only magnified DeSantis\u2019 street cred with so many Americans who wanted a champion to stand up against lockdowns. The Florida governor has followed a similar playbook on other issues \u2013 from immigration to education issues. In September, DeSantis flew migrants from Texas to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where three municipalities had adopted sanctuary policies limiting local law enforcement from enforcing federal immigration laws. While editorials as well as local officials representing those sanctuary jurisdictions heaped scorn on DeSantis\u2019s decision, DeSantis was tapping into widespread national concern about the failure of border enforcement. Four takeaways from DeSantis' new book rehashing his culture clashes as Florida governor More than half of Americans believe it is completely or somewhat true that the United States is experiencing an invasion at the southern border, with 76% of Republicans and 47% of independents holding this view, according to an NPR/Ipsos poll in August. Meanwhile, 59% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents say border security should be very or somewhat important, and almost 4 of 10 Democrats say that increasing deportations is very or somewhat important, according to a Pew Research poll. This widespread bipartisan dissatisfaction on border enforcement provided a vast political space for DeSantis\u2019 decision to relocate migrants. DeSantis also supported a bill that prohibited classroom instruction about sexual orientation or gender identity to kindergarteners and other young students. Disney, a global entertainment conglomerate, opposed it and the hosts of the Academy Awards made fun of the bill on national television. But while Hollywood kingpins and celebrities disapproved of the bill, a New York Times-Siena College poll in September found Republicans united in opposition to such classroom instruction in first through fifth grades (95% against), while 42% of Democrats strongly or somewhat opposed it. More interestingly, 71% of independent voters strongly or somewhat opposed classroom instruction of gender identity to children in elementary school, the poll found. DeSantis issued a proclamation declaring Florida native Emma Weyant the winner of the NCAA Division I women\u2019s 500-yard freestyle final after the NCAA declared Lia Thomas, a transgender woman, the victor. Just like the other issues DeSantis has taken on, Republicans and independent voters were strongly in favor of DeSantis\u2019 position, while Democrats were split almost evenly, according to a NPR/Ipsos poll. Regardless of whether one agrees with his policies or his politics, DeSantis has shown he has a recipe for political and electoral success that has made him the governor of red-state America as well as an effective critic of progressive Democrats.  In today\u2019s \u201ccancel culture\u201d environment, DeSantis has uniquely channeled the emotions of what former President Richard Nixon called the \u201csilent majority.\u201d That term is more politically potent now than it was then, because those voters who consider themselves part of this group \u2013 regardless of whether they are a majority \u2013 feel more silenced than ever. One may be tempted to believe that such a strategy has limited appeal \u2013 but consider the following: In 2020, although Trump beat Biden in Florida, Biden beat Trump by 11 points among independent voters. Yet two years later, DeSantis won back this important bloc of nonpartisan voters, winning a majority of independents and besting his Democratic opponent by 8 points among independents. DeSantis\u2019 proven ability to galvanize Republican voters and simultaneously appeal to a majority of independents is what makes him capable of winning both the GOP presidential nomination as well as the general election, should he choose to run next year. It\u2019s a recipe that has worked brilliantly in Florida \u2013 an incredibly diverse, multicultural and fast-growing megastate. Anyone who doesn\u2019t think it can work elsewhere may belatedly regret such skepticism in 2024.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, dictator Joseph Stalin was too shocked to speak in public for nearly two weeks. On July 3, he finally gave a radio speech, trying to reassure his nation \u2014 already suffering serious battlefield losses to the German blitzkrieg \u2014 with the words, \u201cHistory shows that there are no invincible armies.\u201d Germany\u2019s \u201cOperation Barbarossa\u201d involved more than 3 million troops, about 3,000 tanks and 2,500 aircraft \u2014 one of the largest invasion forces in history. Expecting to conquer Moscow within weeks, Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler thought the Soviet regime would quickly disintegrate. Over the next four years though, Hitler\u2019s armies proved to be anything but invincible. One year ago, Stalin\u2019s heir in the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin, launched an army \u2014 one that he likely thought was invincible \u2014 into Ukraine, aiming to quickly decapitate its leadership and seize Kyiv. His hopes were frustrated by Ukraine\u2019s spirited defense under President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the two nations continue to be locked in a savage conflict. Contrary to what most people expected before the war, it\u2019s a stalemate, observed retired US General David Petraeus, in a Q&A with CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. So how does the Russian leader look a year after his decision? \u201cPutin has earned a failing grade to date,\u201d said Petraeus, who commanded the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cLet\u2019s recall that the first and most important task of a strategic leader is to \u2018get the big ideas right\u2019 \u2014 that is, to get the overall strategy and fundamental decisions right. Putin clearly has failed abysmally in that task, resulting in a war that has made him and his country a pariah, set back the Russian economy by a decade or more (losing many of Russia\u2019s best and brightest, and prompting over 1,200 western companies to leave Russia or reduce operations there), done catastrophic damage to the Russian military and its reputation and put his legacy in serious jeopardy.\u201d Still, it would be a mistake to underestimate Russia, Petraeus noted, citing a maxim often attributed, perhaps wrongly, to Stalin: \u201cQuantity has a quality of its own.\u201d During World War II, the Soviet Union\u2019s ability to call on vast reserves and sustain enormous casualties, despite having inferior tanks and planes, helped it to defeat Germany. Today, Russia\u2019s population is more than three times the size of Ukraine\u2019s and it can afford to send more soldiers into the fight. But in Ukraine\u2019s case there\u2019s an intangible factor. \u201cUkrainians know what they are fighting for,\u201d Petraeus noted, \u201cwhile it is not clear that the same is true of many of the Russian soldiers, a disproportionate number of whom are from ethnic and sectarian minorities in the Russian Federation.\u201d On February 23, 2022, Diliara Didenko, went to bed in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, \u201cthinking that I would celebrate my husband\u2019s birthday the next day. Our life was getting better. My husband was running his own business. Our daughter had started school and made friends there. We were lucky to have arranged support services and found a special needs nursery for our son. I finally had time to work. I felt happy.\u201d She had no inkling that the outbreak of war would force her to restart her life in the Czech Republic within 22 days. \u201cCompletely exhausted, crushed and scared, we had to brace ourselves and come to terms with our forced displacement.

The news alarmed those on campus and rippled out to the enormous alumni network of MSU, which has about 50,000 current students. \u201cI think about the words Michigan Gov.

In the Detroit Free Press, Jemele Hill, who graduated from MSU, wrote, \u201cWhat happened \u2026 is a reminder that the regularity of these acts is bringing violence even closer to all of us. Some of the students whom Americans saw struggling to process what happened had already lived through another mass shooting \u2014 in Oxford, or Newtown, Conn. Many of the students who fled certain buildings on campus the night of the shooting were just following the protocols they\u2019d been taught prior to coming to Michigan State, because teaching children and young adults how not to be killed in mass shootings is now a staple of America\u2019s egregious routine.\u201d For more on guns: Jens Ludwig and Chico Tillmon: There\u2019s no safety net to catch the young men at highest risk of gun violence Now there\u2019s more than one. For months, former President Donald Trump was the only candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. This week, Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the UN, entered the fray, saying, \u201cWe are more than ready for a new generation to lead us into the future.\u201d As SE Cupp noted, Haley called for going beyond the \u201cfaded names of the past\u201d and argued for term limits for members of Congress and \u201cmandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old.\u201d  Trump is 76 and President Joe Biden is 80. But the real question, in Cupp\u2019s view, is this: \u201cWill Haley also bring substantively different views that appeal to younger generations?\u201d \u201cWill she break with the election denialism, grievance politics, white nationalism and conspiracy theories that Trumpism allowed?\u201d And, Cupp added, where will Haley stand on immigration, gun control, climate change, abortion and other issues that particularly resonate with younger voters?

As Jill Filipovic pointed out, the jurors, who likely included some Trump voters, \u201cwere asked to assess whether it\u2019s possible that a former president and his allies had leveraged an attack on American democracy, or whether that president was telling the truth when he said the election was stolen.\u201d In a unanimous conclusion, \u201cthey found that, contrary to the former president\u2019s claims, there was no evidence of widespread fraud undermining the results of the election, and that at least some criminal charges should be brought.\u201d  \u201cIf average people selected for a special grand jury can complete this task with honesty and integrity, surely it\u2019s not asking too much for Republican officeholders to approach their roles with similar gravity: To declare that the election was free and fair, and to ask that those who may have broken the law or lied be held accountable,\u201d wrote Filipovic.

President Biden spoke about the shootdowns for the first time on Thursday, saying that there was no indication the last three were connected to the balloon from China, which US officials said was intended for surveillance. In January, as Peter Bergen noted, the US intelligence community reported that \u201cthe number of UFO sightings significantly increased between March 2021 and August 2022, during which time 247 new sightings were reported, mostly by US Navy and Air Force pilots and personnel. That\u2019s almost double the 144 UFO sightings reported in the 17-year period between 2004 to 2021.\u201d Could the spate of unexplained aircraft have any relation to the ones that were shot down? \u201cCongress should convene hearings to get to the bottom of this,\u201d Bergen wrote.  \u201cThe public has a right to understand why objects are flying around in American airspace that the Pentagon and the US intelligence community can\u2019t identify.\u201d For more: Julian Zelizer: Biden\u2019s \u2018no apologies\u2019 speech should silence his critics.

Frommer. There\u2019s a precedent of sorts. In the early 1950s, interest in professional basketball was declining, prompting the league to introduce a shot clock. \u201cThe impact was immediate: average team scoring per game increased from 79 points to 93.

But for Americans with limitless entertainment options and limited time, it will help attract fans with more exciting (and faster) baseball games than we\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst and anchor. He is the author of \u201cLincoln and the Fight for Peace.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Halfway through his first term and on the eve of his second State of the Union, we can start to see the outlines of how President Joe Biden is going to be judged in the eyes of history \u2014 and ask whether his legacy is likely to be strengthened or weakened if he runs for a second term. Conventional wisdom seems to be congealing around the idea that Biden will run for reelection. Normally, this would be a given. All the inertia pulls in that direction \u2014 the sense of purpose and power and prestige are not given up easily, either by a president or his senior staff. But there are still good reasons for Biden to consider bowing out on his own terms with his reputation as a consequential president intact. This is not an easy call. It requires weighing the risks and rewards of pursuing reelection for a man who would be 86 at the end of his second term while considering the historic trend of second terms ending in disappointment. But just judging by his accomplishments to date, Biden has earned a shot at renomination. He has already established himself as a consequential president in his first two years \u2014 defying the odds and expectations. He took office in a time of national crisis, with a divisive predecessor who lied about the 2020 election results, spurring an attack on our Capitol, in the middle of a pandemic that has killed more than a million Americans. Objectively, the United States is in far better shape two years into Biden\u2019s administration than it was when he took office. Opinion: Sarah Huckabee Sanders is Trumpism repackaged Of course, Biden has not healed our political divisions \u2014 no one could \u2014 and he has had his share of stumbles and minor scandals, leading to an underwater approval rating. But in relatively short order, he has restored personal decency to the Oval Office and presided over a solid record of legislative accomplishments that rivals any modern American president. Biden helped cobble together a bipartisan coalition of senators to pass the largest infrastructure bill in our nation\u2019s history \u2014 a goal that multiple presidents had promised and failed to achieve. He successfully pushed for the bipartisan passage of a major American industrial policy known as the CHIPs Act, focused on investment in high-tech research and development to counter China\u2019s rise. And he capped it off with a massive, Democratic-backed investment to combat climate change while giving Medicare the power to negotiate the prices of some prescription drugs, paid for by a 15% minimum tax on corporate profits. On the economic front, more than half a million new jobs were added to the economy in January alone, bringing Biden\u2019s total to almost 11 million, with the lowest unemployment rate since before man landed on the moon, despite stubbornly high inflation. Main Street growth is outpacing Wall Street for the first time in decades \u2014 while deficits have been cut in half under Biden, but remain above pre-pandemic levels. On foreign policy, America\u2019s image on the world stage has rebounded under President Biden, according to surveys conducted by Pew Research in 2021 and 2022. Biden has earned credit for warning a world in denial about the danger of a Russian invasion in Ukraine and then corralling sustained allied support for Kyiv. Under this longtime believer in multilateral institutions, NATO is stronger and more united than any time since the Cold War and could be on the verge of expansion with the inclusion of Finland and Sweden. Determination to counter China\u2019s expansionist ambitions has continued despite what conservatives\u2019 campaigns have claimed?  \u2014 but with more of a focus on steady results and less bellicose rhetoric. The chaotic and tragic Afghanistan withdrawal is the obvious low point of Biden\u2019s foreign policy record, with the Taliban returning to its brutal fundamentalist form. Add to that the fact that the 2022 midterms were the most successful of any Democratic president in a quarter century. Instead of the traditional shellacking, Democrats gained a seat in the Senate and only narrowly lost the House. Independent voters actually swung toward the incumbent party \u2014 something unheard of in recent decades. Yes, this can be seen as primarily a rejection of Trump-backed election-deniers\u2019 extremism, but it still happened on Biden\u2019s watch, despite his underwater job approval rating and stubbornly high inflation rates at the time. Opinion: The mistake Biden must avoid in his big speech So why not just build on this record of success and run for a second term? Well, there are two intertwining factors that should weigh heavily on the White House: the fact that Biden is already America\u2019s oldest president and the fact that second terms are usually defined by disappointments and outright disasters. Let\u2019s take on the age question, first. Republican slurs that Biden is mentally impaired are fear-mongering politics of the variety that said President Barack Obama couldn\u2019t speak effectively without a teleprompter. But it is fair to point out that age takes a toll \u2013 especially in the gilded pressure cooker of the presidency. Biden is, of course, America\u2019s oldest executive and he does not have the physical vigor we traditionally expect from presidents. And while there are many different ways to be 75 or 80, there are few 85-year-olds who are as mentally crisp as they were even a decade before. Now, add the historical likelihood that scandals and mistakes compound in a second term. The record isn\u2019t great, from Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation to Ronald Reagan\u2019s Iran-Contra scandal to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment to George W. Bush\u2019s Katrina chaos. The recovery of classified documents at Biden\u2019s home and office are a reminder of how scandals can sideswipe an administration on a random Tuesday and leave it playing defense \u2014 and the House Republican investigations into the business practices of his son Hunter Biden promise more scrutiny on family finances  \u2014 and those are the known unknowns we can anticipate. But let\u2019s be real \u2014 a big part of the reluctance to bow out is about giving up the advantage of incumbency. Only 11 presidents have failed to win reelection. Democrats are rational in not wanting to give away this power. If Biden didn\u2019t run, it would open the floodgates for a messy Democratic primary contest with no obvious frontrunner. Trump\u2019s candidacy is ironically one of the chief arguments for Biden staying in the game \u2014 he would have the clear edge in a rematch that most Americans do not want to see. But if the GOP has the discipline to nominate a younger and less damaged candidate, Biden could be weakened by the contrast. With all that to weigh, consider the alternative: Biden\u2019s reputation might be enhanced in history\u2019s eyes if he were to bow out on his own terms after four years. He would be a Cincinnatus figure, voluntarily giving up political power to focus on long-term policy \u2014 a revolutionary act in contrast to his predecessor\u2019s sick willingness to overturn an election to stay in power. Stepping away from power would provide an indelible example of democratic values in action, putting country over party while passing a torch to a new generation to lead the nation, which was one of his core campaign pitches when he first ran for the presidency.  Whether or not Biden runs for reelection, there are still big things he could get done in his remaining two years \u2014 even with a Republican House of Representatives. He could propose comprehensive immigration reform that begins with strengthening border security first. He could build on bipartisan support for algorithm reforms that protect children online and stop the amplification of extremist groups and conspiracy theories. There is renewed focus on the need for police reform and reinvestment. Finally, he could champion civics education, creating a baseline of common understanding of our democratic republic while defusing the culture wars playing out in our schools. The temptations to run for reelection are strong and understandable. But viewing this decision with a sense of historic perspective might inspire Biden and his family to look past the gravitational pull of the office and more toward his place in presidential rankings.",

Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Republicans announced Thursday that Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will deliver the party\u2019s response to President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address next week. Sanders, the former White House press secretary and daughter of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, is part of a larger effort by Republicans to repackage Trumpism in a way that seems more palatable. Sanders represents a new generation of Republicans eager to weaponize the same outrage machine with familiar talking points about the threats of immigration, the so-called radical left\u2019s attacks on education and an economy in shambles under Biden \u2013 while showing that they can govern without the self-defeating chaos and tumult that rocked the nation from 2017 to 2021. The 40-year-old certainly provides a contrast to the 76-year-old former President Donald Trump by virtue of her age and gender. It\u2019s also worth noting her past experience working in the George W. Bush administration \u2013 an experience that ties her to the Republican establishment. But Trump has remade the Republican Party in his image, and Sanders is falling back on the same culture war playbook he used and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis polished. Since she was sworn in as governor at the start of the year, she has taken aim at critical race theory in the classroom and the use of the phrase \u201cLatinx\u201d in state documents. Opinion: What Sarah Huckabee Sanders gets wrong with her 'Latinx' ban None of this should come as a surprise. Sanders stood by former President Donald Trump during the most controversial of controversial moments and defended his family separation policy at the border, insisting that it was the law and that the president was merely enforcing it. She also shares Trump\u2019s resentments, with a view of a world where \u201ceverybody\u2019s against us, everybody\u2019s looking down on us,\u201d as John Brummett, a political columnist in Arkansas, told the New Yorker in 2019. Echoing the rhetoric of Trump and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich \u2014 who pioneered the kind of smashmouth, no-guardrails partisanship that shapes the modern GOP \u2014 Sanders announced Thursday that she was a part of a new group of leaders in her party who were \u201cready to defend our freedom against the radical left\u2026\u201d But Sanders also promised to present an \u201coptimistic vision for the future\u201d in her rebuttal. Given that Trump\u2019s vision was rooted in fear, hate and grievances, her attempted rebranding might be the next stage in the evolution of the GOP. Sanders\u2019 star role should send something of a warning to Trump, who learned this week his former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley is expected to announce her bid for president in 2024. Haley, who could pose a serious threat to Trump in the Republican primary, is in some ways the face of the modern GOP. As a conservative woman born to immigrant parents, she has an extensive record as governor of South Carolina. Though she espouses many of the extreme views held by her former boss, backing his decision to withdraw the US from key international commitments including the Paris climate agreement, for example, Haley will likely sell her competence and ability to promote conservative goals through more traditional political processes. Opinion: Trump's first challenger is the one GOP needs But will any kind of Republican repackaging effort work? It remains to be seen what Sanders has in store when it comes to optimism \u2013 an outlook that seems at odds with conservativism. As for candidates like Haley, voters can likely discern the same old policies and ideas, even when they\u2019re touted by different candidates. The Republican Party has become increasingly extreme over the past few decades, not just because of the officials at the top of the party but because of the themes that they have chosen to focus on. And swing voters who might otherwise be attracted to new Republican faces and hardline positions on issues like crime could still be turned off by the radicalism of the basic Republican agenda, even if there is less toxic tweeting and unconventional political theatrics. Moreover, Sanders is faced with a tall order next week, given that the list of those who respond to the State of the Union is haunted with once promising political stars. It\u2019s a hard act to follow the commander in chief, and those chosen to represent the opposition party rarely pull it off. Since 1966, when Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois and Rep. Gerald Ford of Michigan delivered a relatively successful joint response to President Lyndon Johnson, parties have tried to figure out a way to make these work. But they rarely do. Who can forget Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in 2013, who seemed to move his career 30 steps back when he reached over for a gulp of water right in the middle of speaking, or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose uninspired delivery in 2009 gave comedians fodder for months? Democrats have struggled too, with Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius giving a sleepy response after President George W. Bush in 2008.  The jury\u2019s still out on whether Republican voters really want a change from Trump. Despite all the conversations in the media about whether Trump will start a civil war within the party and force the GOP to undergo a transformation in order to broaden its reach, party support for him remained relatively strong after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. But there are signs that his hold on the party may be weakening, with a CNN/SSRS poll in December finding that 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents wanted their party to nominate someone other than Trump in 2024. Ultimately, Republicans are thirsty for power and eager to win back the White House in 2024. Many of them are still bitter about the outcome of the 2020 election and frustrated that Biden has enjoyed legislative success and an unexpectedly good midterm election result. If someone like Sanders can make the case that Trumpism needs a rebrand \u2014 and embraces many of the same core positions as the former president without the chaos and inefficiency, adds a dash of optimism and demonstrates the GOP is not just a party of angry White men \u2014 that might open a window for a new slate of candidates to jump into the contest for the 2024 nomination.",

View more opinion on CNN. The continuing drama surrounding Republican Rep. George Santos of New York, whose self-constructed identity of lies is being dismantled piece by piece by journalists, is an irresistible spectacle \u2014 an odd concoction of amusing and infuriating. But there\u2019s one particularly disturbing aspect that points to a dangerous weakness in American democracy: Who paid for Santos\u2019 election campaign? In other words, who has the most influence over the congressman? The fact that it is so difficult to track down the source of this fantasist\u2019s support reaffirms something that democracy funding experts have been telling us for years: Corrupt players are taking advantage of how democracy is financed in America. Candidates need a lot of money, and it\u2019s much too easy to hide the source of donations. In the past couple of years, people from other nations with nefarious agendas have been convicted of illegally financing campaigns at the state and federal level, but the problem has not been resolved. Like everything having to do with Santos, he has taken matters to a new level. The muddiness of the congressman\u2019s campaign records is to the nation\u2019s campaign finance problems much as his lies are to the problem of dissembling politicians. It\u2019s on a different scale, and more clumsily deployed. By now, many of Santos\u2019 lies are familiar. Until recently, he was known as Anthony Devolder \u2014 but was also known by some as Anthony Zabrovsky, and used names like George Devolder and George Anthony Devolder-Santos (his real name) for his social media accounts. He claimed to have many degrees, including an MBA from New York University and worked in top financial firms. (He later admitted he never graduated from college.) He claimed his mother was inside the South Tower at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, but records show she was in Brazil on that day. He maintained he was Jewish, the grandchild of Jewish refugees who escaped the Holocaust. But it turns out he has no Jewish ancestors or any connection to the Holocaust. (He later said he \u201cnever claimed to be Jewish\u201d but jokingly said he\u2019s \u201cJew-ish\u201d). The lies keep coming on a relentless conveyor of revelations. He disingenuously said he \u201cembellished\u201d his resume. And, in an interview with the far-right television news channel OAN, he vowed that he has learned his lesson and from now on \u201ceverything is going to be above board,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s largely always been above board.\u201d That\u2019s a lie. Opinion: George Santos' drag days are an asinine smokescreen The most important of his lies is who gave him the money to run for office. (The OAN interviewer did not ask.) Federal law requires candidates to disclose contributors. Not surprisingly, Santos\u2019 \u201cdisclosures\u201d read like fiction. Mother Jones magazine tried to contact donors going back to his failed 2020 congressional bid. It was an exercise in hunting for ghosts. They found that more than a dozen major donations came from people who apparently do not exist, often with addresses that don\u2019t exist. For 2022, it all became even more mysterious. Most intriguing of all is what campaign filings described as loans from Santos to the campaign totaling more than $700,000. With the temperature rising on his invented life, his campaign seemed to have revised the filings, unchecking in some instances the question about whether those big tranches of funding were his own money. It\u2019s worth remembering that during his 2020 congressional bid, Santos reported a $55,000 annual salary and no assets. Two years later he reported a $750,000 salary. All this inconsistent information about his campaign finances begs the questions: Who gave him the funds? Why is he suddenly changing the statement that the money was his? What is he hiding? We do know about some of his donors. There\u2019s Rocco Oppedisano, the Italian national who was caught smuggling undocumented migrants into the US in 2019. He pleaded guilty to smuggling and was sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release. (Santos, incidentally, is a sharp critic of illegal immigration under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.) Opinion: 'Saturday Night Live' sketches aside, George Santos is no joke The Santos campaign also reported making big payments for \u201coutstanding debt\u201d to a New York restaurant owned by Oppedisano\u2019s brother, which Santos vigorously promotes on social media. Then there\u2019s the Santos\u2019 indirect Russian connection. A Washington Post investigation found that donor Andrew Intrater, an American businessman, has long-standing financial links with a sanctioned Russian oligarch as well as with a former key player in former President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle. Intrater reportedly cultivated ties with Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s ex-lawyer and \u201cfixer.\u201d Intrater and his wife made the maximum allowed donation of $5,800 each to the Santos campaign, but they also gave tens of thousands of dollars since 2020 to committees linked to Santos, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. Intrater\u2019s interactions with Cohen, including payments and hundreds of texts, were investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller in his probe into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. (Intrater was not charged.) His firm, according to official filings, had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into Harbor City, a company accused of running a Ponzi scheme where Santos worked before starting a company that Santos claimed paid him more than $3.5 million over the past couple of years. Santos hasn\u2019t offered many clear explanations. He has refused to directly answer questions on the matter and said last week that he would hold a press conference \u201csoon\u201d to \u201caddress everything.\u201d In the meantime, his campaign treasurer resigned, and the man Santos initially said had taken the job said he had done no such thing. The red flags, the opacity of it all, should shine a light on the dangerous swamp that is US election funding. Hiding a contribution by one person under another\u2019s name is prohibited, but what is permitted is even more troubling. The campaign watchdog Open Secrets has raised the alarm over so-called straw donors and shell companies that conceal real donors. They not only cover the tracks of people who may want their identity hidden but also conceal some who may be contributing illegally, injecting \u201cdark money\u201d to manipulate US democracy and lawmaking.  Last year, prosecutors charged that Russian citizen Andrey Muraviev, along with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2013 former associates of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney \u2013 had engaged in a criminal straw donor scheme to funnel $1 million to federal and state campaigns. (Parnas had already been convicted of illegally funneling cash into a pro-Trump PAC in 2018.) Parnas has since been sentenced to 20 months plus three years of supervised parole in the case; Furman has been sentenced to 366 days in prison; and Muraviev is believed to be at large in Russia. If anyone was hoping to use Santos to do their bidding in Congress, their investment is unlikely to pay off. Santos has become synonymous with outlandish lies. If anyone was hoping to acquire influence through him for their preferred policies, the campaign financing appears to have backfired. Santos\u2019 credibility and ethics are so compromised that his endorsement for a view could draw unwanted scrutiny. That was my reaction, for example, when I saw Santos\u2019 comments about Ukraine a year ago, just after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Speaking at a far-right convention, Santos declared, \u201cIt\u2019s not like Ukraine is a great democracy. It\u2019s a totalitarian regime,\u201d claiming that Ukrainians were welcoming Russians; essentially parroting the Kremlin\u2019s talking points. That was from George Santos, or Anthony Devolder, who, by the way, also claimed his grandfather was Ukrainian. It can all be \u2013 let\u2019s confess \u2013 very entertaining. Even so, we must get to the most important of the fabulist\u2019s secrets: who really paid to make him a congressman.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cThere\u2019s a new sheriff in town,\u201d Eddie Murphy warned in the 1982 film \u201c48 Hrs.\u201d Ten years later, Michael Jordan used those words to remind fellow basketball legends Magic Johnson and Larry Bird that there was a younger generation of NBA stars. Last weekend, new sheriffs took over the House of Representatives, with Rep. Kevin McCarthy finally winning the speakership after 15 ballots emphasized the bitter divisions in his party. And the first week of their rule brought new faces into key leadership roles, as Republicans organized their team after narrowly wresting control of the House in November\u2019s midterm election. But many things the GOP majority did were not a surprise. They moved quickly to take advantage of revelations about President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents from his time as vice president, following the Washington playbook established during the controversy over Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and magnified by the Justice Department\u2019s effort to retrieve documents from former President Donald Trump\u2019s home at Mar-a-Lago. As their first bill, House Republicans passed a measure to strip new funding from the IRS \u2013 a move that will go nowhere in the Senate. And McCarthy showed no inclination to discipline one of his party\u2019s own members, Rep. George Santos, whose self-touted accomplishments have turned out to be largely fictional. Classified documents were found in an office at Biden\u2019s former think tank and a garage at his Wilmington, Delaware, home, leading Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate, just as he has for Trump. \u201cRepublicans will try to use this as a cudgel to beat up on Biden and distract from their own issues, but if Trump\u2019s classified documents were in the wrong place, so were Biden\u2019s \u2013 and, just calling balls and strikes here, they deserve the same level of accountability,\u201d said SE Cupp. \u201cThere is a huge difference between Trump and Biden, however. Remember, the FBI had to go search Mar-a-Lago for documents Trump insisted he didn\u2019t have.\u201d Bradley P. Moss, a lawyer specializing in national security issues, wrote, \u201cTo paraphrase Robert Frost, the roads these two men were on diverged in a wood, and Biden took the one the law requires you to travel on.\u201d \u201cUnlike Trump, who spent nearly 18 months delaying, obfuscating and arguably obstructing efforts by the federal government to recover from Mar-a-Lago all of the documents with classification markings, Biden\u2019s team appears to have played by the book.\u201d With only a small majority in the House, McCarthy would naturally fear losing Santos\u2019 New York seat in a special election. So far, wrote Julian Zelizer, \u201cSantos has refused to step down after his resume turned out to be a tissue of lies, and it will be extremely difficult to remove him from office. There remains a very good chance that the legislator who peddled numerous falsehoods about his personal and professional experience stays in the House with all the authority that comes from being a representative.\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Friday that the US is about to hit the ceiling on the national debt approved by Congress, setting in motion what could be a high-stakes battle over spending between the Republican House and the Democratic-controlled White House and Senate. In the Washington Post, Catherine Rampell wrote, \u201cTo be clear: Refusing to raise the debt limit, or even coming close to default, would be catastrophic...Until now, U.S. debt has been considered virtually risk-free. The riskiness of all other assets around the world is benchmarked against the relative safety of U.S. Treasury securities. If the U.S. government reveals itself to be an unreliable borrower, however, expect to see shockwaves course through every other financial market, as many question how safe (or not) those other investments might be.\u201d Republican Lanhee J. Chen wrote that members of the GOP are right to warn that spending is on an unsustainable path.  \u201cAs America ages and more people rely on both Medicare and Social Security in the coming years, both programs will only increase their financial strain on federal budgets,\u201d Chen observed. \u201cSocial Security will exhaust its retirement trust fund reserves in 10 years \u2013 a shortfall that, if unaddressed, would result in an immediate and draconian across-the-board cut in benefits. Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund, which pays inpatient health benefits, will have its reserves exhausted within the next five years, triggering provider payment cuts that could jeopardize seniors\u2019 access to care.\u201d \u201cThe case for reform \u2013 and reform now \u2013 is clear, as the fiscal challenges in Medicare and Social Security only get more difficult to solve with the passage of time.\u201d What complicates the picture, Chen added, is that during Trump\u2019s presidency, \u201cthe party of spending restraint and balanced budgets has been complicit in ballooning budgets and kicked the can down the road on entitlement reform in the name of political expediency.\u201d The Republican effort to stop expanding the IRS\u2019 workforce is misguided, wrote Patrick T. Brown. \u201cWhile the reflexive small-government ideology of many conservatives made picking a fight over the IRS inevitable, there are legitimate reasons to drop the issue \u2013 including a recognition that a movement of the working class might welcome slightly more efficient government services and care a little less about rates of tax audits on the wealthy,\u201d Brown noted. Much of the increase in IRS funding will go for upgrading technology and improving customer service for taxpayers \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing, he wrote.

Why hasn\u2019t Biden fixed it yet? Dean Obeidallah: Hakeem Jeffries gave the speech that Kevin McCarthy should have \u2014 but won\u2019t Norman Eisen: I worked on document handling issues in government. Here\u2019s why Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s cases are different Nicole Hemmer: Trump isn\u2019t the author of the right\u2019s worsening chaos Ed Morales: What Sarah Huckabee Sanders gets wrong with her \u2018Latinx\u2019 ban Prince Harry\u2019s memoir \u201cSpare\u201d is a huge hit \u2013 selling 1.4 million copies in its first day in the US, Canada and the UK, according to the publisher. There\u2019s more to the book than the headline-grabbing revelations about the prince\u2019s personal life and family relationships, wrote Louis Staples. The book is \u201ca sad read about a man who is clearly hurt and damaged. A man who, by accident of birth and through tragedy, has never had complete control over his own life.\u201d \u201cYes, this book is occasionally contradictory, out-of-touch and features plenty of toe-curling details I would have been much happier not knowing\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd yes, a break from hearing about the Sussexes would be very welcome. But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, for his loudest detractors, this is bigger than Prince Harry. His most virulent critics feel threatened and betrayed by the version of modern masculinity he represents \u2013 one that, like the Prince himself, is trying to break free from its past.\u201d A 6-year-old boy who took his mother\u2019s legally purchased handgun to school shot a teacher on January 6. While the teacher is expected to survive, \u201cno one \u2013 not her, not the boy, not the other students in the Newport News, Virginia, school \u2013 can possibly come out of this unscathed,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cAnd yet again, those who place gun rights above all other interests offer nothing more than thoughts and prayers, while the rest of us look around, defeated, wondering how it can be that we live in a nation that simply accepts this kind of violence as a routine cost of the \u2018freedom\u2019 to own weapons designed to end human life.\u201d Had Martin Luther King Jr. lived, he would have turned 94 on Sunday. And, as Peniel E. Joseph wrote, the social issues of today would not have surprised him. In the 1960s, \u201ccivil rights activists were pilloried as anti-American subversives, Communist dupes and an unpatriotic mob, rhetoric echoed in contemporary attacks against Black Lives Matter (BLM) protesters and even school teachers, whose classroom explorations of Black and American history have triggered a political backlash reminiscent of the civil rights era,\u201d Joseph noted. \u201cThen, as now, racism, war, poverty and violence scarred the domestic landscape, and its parallel growth in the international arena threatened world peace and stability. \u201cSocial justice movements swelled at home and abroad and anti-democratic forces organized strongholds in America that, although rooted in the Deep South\u2019s former Confederacy, stretched from sea to shining sea. At the same time, the search for what King called the Beloved Community \u2013 a world free of the war\u2019s pestilence, racism\u2019s violence and poverty\u2019s indignity \u2013 inspired social justice and peace activists in King\u2019s time, just as ours.\u201d Noma, the $500-per-dinner restaurant that has been rated among the world\u2019s best, announced Monday that it\u2019s closing to diners next year and reinventing itself as a food lab. While Noma started paying its interns in October, the New York Times told the story of an intern who flew to Copenhagen in 2017 to work at the famed restaurant for three months with no pay.  Her \u201csole job was to produce fruit-leather beetles, starting with a thick jam of black fruit and silicone stencils with insect parts carved out.\u201d She said she was required to work silently and forbidden from laughing. In a column that praised the experience of dining at Noma, Times restaurant critic Pete Wells wrote, \u201cThe competition to be \u2018the world\u2019s best restaurant\u2019 \u2014 a meaningless title, but one that has an irresistible pull for chefs and headline writers \u2014 has distorted cooking, warped service, inflated check totals, padded menus and stolen hours from customers\u2019 lives and many, many more hours from the lives of chefs and their workers, whether paid or unpaid. Most of the overkill restaurants could not last a week without free labor.\u201d Restaurants face a crisis, wrote Saru Jayaraman, co-founder and president of One Fair Wage and director of the Food Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. We are living in \u201ca historic moment that goes beyond the problem of intern labor (but is related to the ugly economic reality of fine dining). Both in the United States and internationally, millions of workers in all segments of the restaurant industry are refusing to work for the wages and working conditions they accepted for decades, and a massive staffing crisis has resulted in thousands of restaurants recognizing that the model of backbreaking work for little or no wages used for over a century is unsustainable.\u201d Arick Wierson: There\u2019s no way to sugarcoat it \u2013 Brazil attacks were the start of an attempted coup Don Lincoln: Finally, good news that inspires some hope for climate change Madeleine Deliee: Lawsuit over 1968 teenage nude scenes requires a rethink of \u2018Romeo and Juliet\u2019 Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji: Don\u2019t be fooled, a recession really is coming Lauren Ghazal: When nurses are at risk, our patients are too Jonathan Reiner: Stop using Hamlin\u2019s cardiac arrest for the anti-vax agenda Paul Sracic: Biden, don\u2019t be afraid of trade Frida Ghitis: Iran\u2019s most powerful weapon isn\u2019t working David A.

Perry: The staggering mistake Hamline University made is no isolated incident AND\u2026 Walking along a rushing river in California, Amy Ettinger asked her 13-year-old daughter, \u201cWhat do you think is worse: the floods or the fires?\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t need to pause for long before answering. \u2018Definitely the fires because of the smell,\u2019 she said.\u201d \u201cIt was, to be fair, an impossible choice \u2013 especially for a child barely into her teens. The apocalyptic weather in California is upending all of our lives, but that\u2019s true for no one more so than for our kids.\u201d At least 19 people have died as a result of the series of powerful storms that hit the country\u2019s most populous state. While some of the rainfall will help ease the region\u2019s chronic drought, it is upending lives up and down the coast. \u201cAny child who lives here can tell you that you need to plan for potential smoke in the fall because the dry, drought-ravaged hillsides can spark in a moment. Now, Julianna will also have the memory of what it\u2019s like to watch basic infrastructure like roads and bridges wash away from the rain.\u201d Note: An earlier version of this article misspelled Larry Bird\u2019s name.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Oral arguments resume at the Supreme Court next week, with student debt relief, immigration and labor relations among the cases on the agenda. The top US court will hear from some of the nation\u2019s finest attorneys on issues impacting the daily lives of Americans. But sadly, only a tiny subset of our fellow citizens will be able to watch the justices in action. That\u2019s because the high court still forbids any video recording in its courtroom. Now more than ever, this outdated policy needs to change. Supreme Court proceedings are no secret: The court already provides transcripts and audio recordings of oral arguments. And 50 seats are set aside for the general public to attend oral arguments in the courtroom. But many people can\u2019t or don\u2019t know how to readily access those transcripts, which in any case, don\u2019t convey tone of voice, body language and other nuances of the exchanges between the justices and attorneys appearing before them during oral arguments. And competition for the limited number of seats can be fierce, often involving lining up in the early morning hours \u2013 or sometimes even camping out the night before \u2013 to be permitted entry. Why should access to oral arguments be limited to the well-connected? Or to people who live in or near Washington, DC, and who may be in a position to spend hours at the Supreme Court? Roberts calls for judicial security in year-end report while avoiding mention of ethics reform or abortion draft leak Allowing cameras into the courtroom \u2013 in much the way that C-SPAN currently broadcasts and re-airs proceedings of the US House of Representatives and Senate \u2013 would provide Americans a window into what one nonpartisan advocacy group called \u201cthe most powerful, least accountable part of government.\u201d Broadcasting coverage of Supreme Court arguments is an idea that is neither radical nor partisan. In 2016, the Government Accountability Office released a report examining the potential value of live audio and video coverage of the high court\u2019s proceedings. The GAO concluded that cameras would increase civic interest and educate the public about the judiciary. And there can be little doubt about public interest in such proceedings: Americans have shown they\u2019re willing to tune into politics when afforded the opportunity. Millions of people tuned in for the January 6 committee hearings, for Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial and for his second second impeachment trial. Nevertheless, Chief Justice John Roberts was less than encouraging when he was queried in 2018 on the subject of introducing cameras in the courtroom. \u201c[W]e\u2019re a very cautious institution. I think our process for hearing and adjudicating cases is working very well, and I think changing something as dramatically as televising the proceedings I think would be harmful and I do worry,\u201d Roberts explained. Opinion: Trust in the Supreme Court is grievously wounded Given how the court\u2019s conservative majority tossed aside decades of precedent to overturn Roe v. Wade last year, it is hard to see how Roberts\u2019 description of the court as \u201ca very cautious institution\u201d \u2013 to say nothing of his assertion that the court\u2019s processes are working well \u2013 squares with reality. In fact, just the opposite is true, at least in terms of the public\u2019s perception. Trust in the Supreme Court is at a record low. According to Gallup, only 4 in 10 Americans say they approve of how the Supreme Court is handling its job; nearly 6 in 10 disapprove. Several of the current justices, including Roberts, Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan, who seemed open to the idea of cameras while they were nominees, changed their minds once they were seated on the bench. Another justice, Sonia Sotomayor, in a 2019 TV interview suggested that introducing cameras might encourage showboating, in an institution that prides itself on its reserve and sense of decorum. \u201cEvery decision we make is written, fully explained, fully defended, fully laid out. But you can\u2019t do that and maintain a show,\u201d Sotomayor said. However, no one is seeking a show. The public simply deserves the opportunity to watch the court at work \u2013 as they might watch meetings held by their local school board or city council. It\u2019s hardly a big ask, considering the nine justices have lifetime appointments \u2013 and an outsize impact on Americans\u2019 lives. Some legal experts who agree with Sotomayor argue that live cameras in the courtroom will result in lawyers performing for the cameras, or might encourage protesters determined to disrupt the court\u2019s proceedings. They fail to understand that the justices \u2013 aided, of course, by marshals and court officers \u2013 can manage their own proceedings. And, frankly, if dysfunctional behavior does break out in the court, the public should be able to see and judge it for themselves.  Any downside of cameras is outweighed by the immense benefits of judicial openness. But the high court is out of touch and disinclined to reform itself. The only way to get to that outcome comes via the legislative branch. The new Congress should mandate camera access at the high court, a move last attempted in bipartisan legislation in 2021. The measure failed to advance in Congress. In his annual report on the state of the federal judiciary, Roberts failed to address controversies swirling around the court, including last year\u2019s leak of a draft copy of the Dobbs decision prior to its official announcement; a New York Times report alleging the leak of the 2014 Hobby Lobby opinion; and efforts by Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, to get Republican officials to challenge the outcome of the 2020 presidential election \u2013 which Thomas said after the fact that she regretted. As the high court grapples with a profound legitimacy crisis, bringing transparency into its decision-making process would be good for the public \u2013 and for the court itself. Opening its deliberations to greater public scrutiny can only help this beleaguered institution.",

            "article_content": "Six months into his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump made a telling admission. \u201cI don\u2019t normally do stops like this,\u201d he told the officers at a local police precinct in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, who were there to deliver an endorsement. The political newcomer had all but abandoned the traditional campaign model that steered his rivals toward crowded diners, Rotary clubhouses and the occasionally combative town hall. Having spent much of his career in the media spotlight, Trump instead preferred headline-grabbing settings \u2013 giant arenas with rowdy crowds. It was striking, then, that Trump chose small-scale settings for his first campaign outings last weekend. Without the novelty that helped catapult him into the White House in 2016 or the presidential jet he used as a campaign prop in 2020, some allies have encouraged Trump to freshen up his image by modifying the way he campaigns, making smaller stops, especially when there are advantageous opportunities for him to do so. Trump struggles to fundraise in early weeks of 2024 campaign That approach was on display last Saturday, when he appeared in two early voting states, speaking to hundreds \u2013 not thousands \u2013 of people at a New Hampshire high school auditorium and the South Carolina state house. In New Hampshire, he delivered scripted remarks at the annual state GOP meeting. And in South Carolina, flanked by his newly announced state leadership team, the former president promised to run a campaign that would look to the future after spending much of the previous two years fixated on the past. But perhaps the most surprising moment of Trump\u2019s campaign debut was his impromptu visit to a South Carolina ice cream and hamburger shop, where he greeted voters, ordered a chocolate-dipped cone, and took selfies with patrons. At one point during the stop, Trump was captured on video bowing his head in reverence as a woman prayed over him \u2013 the kind of viral moment that generations of presidential candidates have sought and one that Trump later told aides he was very pleased with, according to people familiar with the matter. While Trump\u2019s first 2024 campaign swing still featured staples of his previous two campaigns \u2013 fawning allies, speeches littered with red-meat policy pronouncements, odd rants about wind turbines, and false claims about undocumented immigrants \u2013 the smaller settings were nevertheless welcomed by his aides and allies. \u201cHe is at his best in smaller settings. I know he obviously likes doing rallies but the more events he can do like this weekend, the better. That moment of the lady praying over him, you can\u2019t get that if you\u2019re just flying in and out for a campaign rally,\u201d said one former Trump campaign aide. Sources close to Trump said his team is planning for more small-scale events, which they believe put the former president directly in front of local party figures whose voices and endorsements can carry weight in early-voting states. Multiple sources familiar with the matter said Trump\u2019s remarks at the annual New Hampshire GOP meeting fit neatly into that category. The former president was able to schmooze with local GOP officials, while unveiling a major addition to his team in the first-in-the-nation primary state \u2013 announcing that outgoing New Hampshire GOP Chairman Stephen Stepanek would join as a senior adviser. Campaign aides said it was a no-brainer for him to attend. \u201cThat was the perfect environment and perfect venue. He got to lay out what he wants to do and emphasize who he is bringing on to the team. Everyone thought it was a good idea,\u201d said Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign. Trump allies felt the same about his appearance in South Carolina, where the grandeur of the state capitol and the presence of Republican Gov. Henry McMaster compensated for the otherwise small crowd. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do these types of events in 2020 and I think showing up to a state party meeting or state capitol and touching gloves with local leaders and legislators \u2013 it\u2019s a totally different way to get your message across and allows you to have more spontaneous moments,\u201d said the former Trump campaign aide. Still, aides recognize there are also benefits to his marquee rallies. \u201cEventually, there will be rallies,\u201d said Cheung. \u201cHe\u2019s going to continue the momentum that was built up from Saturday.\u201d Jim Yates, a longtime Trump supporter from South Carolina, said he\u2019d like to see Trump hold a mix of smaller events and big rallies. Yates, 76, attended Trump\u2019s South Carolina campaign event, where a few hundred supporters crowded beneath the state house rotunda to listen to him speak. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to reach out to everybody and have it at various locations and attract different groups,\u201d Yates said. One source close to the Trump campaign said it\u2019s likely they will fill his schedule with both formats in the coming months, though this person acknowledged that Trump may abandon the smaller events if any of his potential rivals begin hosting their own mega rallies or campaign events. The former president himself has insisted to aides that they continue to plan large rallies in Trump-friendly states to showcase his ability to draw a crowd. The former president\u2019s last mega rally occurred during the 2022 midterm cycle. \u201cRallies can get repetitive; they all bleed together. You don\u2019t want anyone to constantly be in the same setting because you get the same thing over and over again,\u201d said the person close to the Trump campaign. Of course, smaller settings and scripted speeches can also work against the former president if he fails to bring the same electricity and candor that attendees of his signature campaign rallies wait hours in line to witness. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to work hard to win over some New Hampshire Republicans,\u201d said one Granite State Republican operative, noting that while Trump maintains a supportive base in the state, not all of his past supporters are committed to backing him again in 2024. Trump\u2019s first weekend campaign swing was also the first major test of his messaging since launching his 2024 campaign, following two years of advice from allies and advisers to stop exhaustively relitigating the 2020 election and instead develop a message that moves his campaign forward and places him at the front of the GOP primary field, which is widely expected to expand in the coming months. \u201cThis campaign will be about the future,\u201d Trump promised in South Carolina. \u201cThis campaign will be about issues. Joe Biden has put America on the fast track to ruin and destruction and we will ensure that he does not receive four more years.\u201d To supplement the forward-driven message he delivered on Saturday, the Trump campaign has spent weeks releasing policy videos that give GOP primary voters a glimpse of what he would aim to accomplish with a second term. The videos, shared across social media, have gained popularity among Trump allies who have long encouraged him to build a better case for why he needs a second term. In them, he has vowed to rein in Big Tech, give parents more control over what their children are taught and by whom, and sign an executive order barring government officials from censoring speech. On Tuesday, Trump vowed to \u201ccombat\u201d certain medical treatments for transgender youth in a policy video, his latest foray into the same culture war battles that have enabled the rise of some of his potential rivals, including Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia. \u201cWhen I\u2019m president, we will put parents back in charge and give them the final say. If any principal is not getting the job done, the parents should be able to vote to fire them and select someone who will,\u201d Trump said in a policy video released days before he hit the campaign trail, later repeating the promise in New Hampshire and South Carolina. But several of Trump\u2019s allies fear he\u2019s still too entrenched in the past and have continued privately voicing concerns about the viability of his third run, including as his own assurances about focusing on the future remain a big question inside even his own inner circle. The former president has often pushed back on that advice, arguing that his message is strong enough as it is, and one source close to him said his proclivity for focusing on the 2020 election will be tough to break because he still regularly hears from members of his base who believe so-called election integrity is an important talking point as he seeks reelection. Another adviser said that despite the defeat of several Trump-backed midterm candidates who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election, Trump has said he does not believe their losses were tied to their election lies. \u201cHe was right about it, talking about it strongly. And I think, yeah, it\u2019s fine to talk about somewhat but now it\u2019s time to move on,\u201d said Yates, the South Carolina-based Trump supporter. Nearly three months into his 2024 campaign, Trump has continued operating with a much leaner operation than in his last two races, with about 40 members of his team in place across his campaign\u2019s Palm Beach, Florida, office and early voting states, according to a person familiar with the matter. While Stepanek will oversee his New Hampshire team over the next several months, Trump has also tapped Iowa operatives Eric Brandstad and Alex Latcham ahead of the caucuses there, which he lost in 2016. However, the two operatives are not solely focused on Iowa and have not yet started to build out a ground operation, said a source familiar with the matter. While Trump was joined by a handful of aides on his first campaign jaunt, including his three most senior advisers \u2013 Brian Jack, Susie Wiles, and Chris LaCivita \u2013 he has still struggled to recruit some players who worked on his previous campaigns or in his administration but are hesitant to leave their private sector jobs to return to his orbit. At least three people who have been offered positions with his campaign have turned them down, suggesting they may join at a later date, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump is also bracing for potential rivals to begin entering the field in the coming months, a development that could affect his messaging and campaign strategy. The former president told reporters over the weekend that he had recently heard from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who also served as US ambassador to the United Nations during his administration. She had called to inform him of her interest in seeking the GOP presidential nomination. \u201cGo by your heart if you want to run,\u201d Trump claimed he told her, while noting that Haley previously said she wouldn\u2019t challenge her former boss in the 2024 primary. It is DeSantis, however, who has drawn the most attention and criticism from Trump and his aides. Despite DeSantis\u2019 growing popularity among Republicans, he has yet to be fully vetted on a national stage \u2013 something the Trump team is eager to see play out if the Florida governor mounts a presidential campaign later this year, as is widely expected. Unlike DeSantis, who has kept a tight inner circle, Trump\u2019s campaign is made up in part of several former aides and advisers to the Florida governor, who may be able to provide insight into the elusive Republican if and when he challenges their current boss. Wiles, Jason Miller, who serves as both an informal Trump campaign adviser and CEO of right-wing social media platform Gettr, and Justin Caporale, a senior Trump campaign aide, all previously worked for DeSantis and have knowledge of how he has operated in the past.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 effort to tackle root causes of migration from Central America has yielded more than $4.2 billion in private sector commitments, but border crossings remain high amid mass migration in the Western Hemisphere. In March 2021, during an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, President Joe Biden tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts with the Northern Triangle. At the time, most minors apprehended on the US southern border were from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras \u2013 a region where major hurricanes and the coronavirus pandemic took a devastating toll. Republicans seized on the assignment, dubbing Harris the \u201cborder czar\u201d \u2013 a title the White House rejected, arguing that her focus was on long-term fixes. And last year, as an affront to Harris, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, began busing migrants to her residence at the Naval Observatory. Since being tasked with tackling root causes, Harris has only occasionally talked about the effort as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, latched onto the issue from the outset of the new Congress, with plans to hold a congressional hearing on the matter just hours before the president\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday. A senior administration official recognized the attention on the US-Mexico border but maintained that Harris\u2019 work is not intended to solve the immediate issues on the ground there. \u201cThe vice president\u2019s work and what we\u2019re focused on this afternoon is thinking long term and getting at the root of the problem as the administration simultaneously addresses the immediate challenges at the border,\u201d the senior administration official told reporters Monday. In El Salvador, there\u2019s been concern about limiting checks and balances in government, while in Guatemala, there have been concerns about government corruption. And in Honduras, there was an even greater concern about corruption within the government before President Xiomara Castro\u2019s election. But Castro has also struggled to make inroads rooting out corruption and curtailing organized crime, which has rankled the country for decades. Harris has leaned on the private sector to shore up support for Central America, along with the Partnership for Central Americas, which acts as a liaison between companies and the US government. Around 47 companies and organizations are collaborating across financial services, textiles and apparel, agriculture, technology, telecommunications, and nonprofit sectors to bolster the region\u2019s economy, according to a White House fact sheet. Among those companies are Chegg, an online-learning platform that has committed to certifying 100,000 young adult students in Honduras by 2030, Nestle, which is supporting thousands of coffee producers, and Target. On Monday, Harris will meet with private sector leaders and administration officials to strategize next steps. There, Harris will announce more than $950 million in new commitments, bringing the total to more than $4.2 billion, the senior administration official said. Experts credit Harris\u2019 ability to secure private sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the durability of those investments over the long term. Senior administration officials argued Monday that the investments have begun to show results on the ground. For example, the Honduran Coffee Company and Grupo Cadelga committed nearly $3 million and $850,000, respectively, to partner with the US Agency for International Development to assist over 10,000 coffee farmers. The next phase of Harris\u2019 initiative, dubbed \u201cCentral America Forward,\u201d will focus on good governance and labor rights. New commitments from the US government include a so-called US Government Northern Central America Investment Facilitation Team to support clean energy infrastructure development, USAID workforce development programs, and continued efforts to empower women in the region. \u201cWe believe that these efforts really go hand in hand with the private sector investments \u2026 to create a sort of positive ecosystem that will provide opportunity and hope,\u201d the senior administration official said. Harris and the Partnership for Central America have also set forth goals to provide digital access to millions of people in the region, create jobs, and increase incomes of thousands of farmers, among other initiatives, over the coming years. But in the interim, migration remains at historic highs amid deteriorating conditions in Latin America that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. And it\u2019s increasingly included more migrants from countries outside of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala \u2013 posing a unique challenge to the Biden administration. Last December, border authorities took 77,043 migrants from Cuba or Nicaragua into custody, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. That\u2019s compared to 52,776 encounters with migrants from Mexico and northern Central America, marking a drop from December 2021. It\u2019s unclear what affect Harris\u2019 effort has had on migration, with another administration official calling it part of the \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d toward stemming the flow of people journeying to the US southern border. More than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have fled the country. Nicaraguans have also increasingly been migrating, as well as Haitians who had moved to the region years ago. The administration recently announced a program that allows migrants from Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Venezuela to apply to legally come to the United States. Those who arrive to the US-Mexico border without applying for the program, however, can be turned away by border authorities under a Covid-era border restriction, known as Title 42.",

            "article_content": "Left vs. right. Woke vs. the unwoke. Red State Jesus vs. Blue State Jesus. There are some leaders who see faith and politics strictly as an either/or competition: You win by turning out your side and crushing the opposition. But the Rev. William J. Barber II, who has been called \u201cthe closest person we have to MLK\u201d in contemporary America, has refined a third mode of activism called \u201cfusion politics.\u201d It creates political coalitions that often transcend the conservative vs. progressive binary. Barber, a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d recipient, says a coalition of the \u201crejected stones\u201d of America\u2014the poor, immigrants, working-class whites, religious minorities, people of color and members of the LGBTQ community can transform the country because they share a common enemy. \u201cThe same forces demonizing immigrants are also attacking low-wage workers,\u201d the North Carolina pastor said in an interview several years ago. \u201cThe same politicians denying living wages are also suppressing the vote; the same people who want less of us to vote are also denying the evidence of the climate crisis and refusing to act now; the same people who are willing to destroy the Earth are willing to deny tens of millions of Americans access to health care.\u201d Barber\u2019s fusion politics has helped transform the 59-year-old pastor into one of the country\u2019s most prominent activist and speakers. As co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, he has helped lead one of the nation\u2019s most sustained and visible anti-poverty efforts. He electrified the crowd at the 2016 Democratic National Convention with a speech that one commentator called a \u201cdrop the mic\u201d moment. And at a time when both political parties have been accused of ignoring the working class, Barber routinely organizes and marches with groups such as fast-food workers and union members. \u201cThere is a sleeping giant in America,\u201d Barber told CNN. \u201cPoor and low-wealth folks now make up 30% of the electorate in every state and over 40% of the electorate in every state where the margin of victory for the presidency was less than 3%.  If you could just get that many poor and low-wealth people to vote, they could fundamentally shift every election in the country.\u201d Starting this month, Barber will take his fusion politics to the Ivy League. Yale Divinity School has announced he\u2019ll be the founding director of its new Center for Public Theology and Public Policy. In that role, Barber says he hopes to train a new generation of leaders who will be comfortable \u201ccreating a just society both in the academy and in the streets.\u201d Though he\u2019s stepping down as pastor of the North Carolina church where he has served for 30 years, Barber says he is not retiring from activism. He remains president of Repairers of the Breach, a nonprofit that promotes moral fusion politics. Barber recently spoke to CNN about his faith and activism and why he opposes White Christian nationalism, a movement that insists the US was founded as a Christian nation and seeks to erase the separation of church and state. Barber\u2019s answers were edited for brevity and clarity. You\u2019ve talked about poverty as a moral issue and said the US cannot tolerate record levels of inequality. But some extreme levels of poverty have always existed in this country. Why is it so urgent to face those problems now, and why should someone who isn\u2019t poor care? Doctor King used to say America has a high blood pressure of creeds, but an anemia of deeds.  In every generation we\u2019ve had to have a moment to focus on the urgency of the right now. We will never be able to fix our democracy until we fully face these issues. We will constantly ebb and flow out of recessions because inequality hurts us all. Joseph Stiglitz (the Nobel Prize-winning economist) talks about this in his book \u201cThe Price of Inequality,\u201d and says that it costs us more as a nation for these inequalities to exist than it would for us to fix them. Look at how much it costs us to not have a living (minimum) wage. There was a group of Nobel Peace Prize-winning economists two years ago that debunked the notion that paying people a living wage (the federal minimum wage in the US is $7.25 an hour) would hurt business. They said it\u2019s not true. Well, President Roosevelt said that in the 1930s. He said that any corporation that didn\u2019t pay people a living wage didn\u2019t deserve to be an American corporation. I don\u2019t think that American society as a democracy can stand much more.  We\u2019re moving toward 50% of all Americans being poor and low wealth. It\u2019s unnecessary. Christian nationalism attempts to sanctify oppression and not liberation. It attempts to sanctify lies and not truth. At best it\u2019s a form of theological malpractice. At worst, it\u2019s a form of heresy. Rev. William J. Barber II We say in our founding documents that every politician swears to promote the general welfare of all people. You\u2019re not promoting the general welfare of all people when you can get elected and go to Congress and get free health care but then sit in Congress and block the people who elected you from having the same thing. We say equal protection under the law is fundamental. Well, there\u2019s nothing equal about corporations getting all kinds of tax breaks and all kinds of ways to make more and more money, while the average worker makes 300% less than the CEOs. Some people cite the scripture where Jesus says, \u201cThe poor you always have with you\u201d to argue that poverty is inevitable, and that trying to end it is a hopeless cause. Every time they say that, they are misquoting Jesus. Because that\u2019s not what Jesus meant or said. He was saying, yeah, the poor are going to be with you always, because he was quoting from Deuteronomy [15:11]. The rest of that scripture says the poor will always be with you because of your greed \u2014 I\u2019m paraphrasing it, but that\u2019s the meaning of it. The poor will always be with you is a critique of our unwillingness to address poverty. To have this level of inequality existing is a violation of our deepest moral, constitutional and  religious values. It\u2019s morally inconsistent, morally indefensible, and economically insane. Why would you not want to lift 55 to 60 million people out of poverty if you could by paying them a basic living wage? Why would you not want that amount of resources coming to people and then coming back into the economy? I want to ask you about Christian nationalism. What\u2019s wrong with saying God loves America and that the country should be built on Christian values? God doesn\u2019t say it. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with it. The scriptures says God loves all people and that if a nation is going to embrace Christian values, then we got to know what those values are. And those values certainly aren\u2019t anti-gay, against people who may have had an abortion, pro-tax cut, pro one party and pro-gun. There\u2019s nowhere in the scriptures where you see Jesus lifting that up. Jesus said the Gospel is about good news to the poor, healing to the brokenhearted, welcoming all people, caring for the least of these: the immigrant, the hungry, the sick, the imprisoned.  Christian nationalism attempts to sanctify oppression and not liberation. It attempts to sanctify lies and not truth. At best, it\u2019s a form of theological malpractice. At worst, it\u2019s a form of heresy. When you have some people calling themselves Christian nationalists, you never hear them say, \u201cJesus said this.\u201d They say, \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, and I say it.\u201d But that\u2019s not good enough. If it doesn\u2019t line up with the founder, then it\u2019s flawed. Are you an evangelical? I\u2019m very much an evangelical. I tell folks that I\u2019m a conservative, liberal, evangelical Christian. And what that means is I believe in Jesus, not to the exclusion of other faith traditions because my founder said that \u201cI have others who are not of this fold.\u201d  I believe that love, truth, mercy, grace and justice are fundamental to a life of faith. And for me to be evangelical means to start where Jesus started. The word \u201cevangel\u201d is good news. When Jesus used that phase it was in his first sermon, which was a public policy sermon. He said it in the face of Caesar, where Caesar had hurt and exploited the poor. He said it right in the ghetto of Nazareth, where people said, \u201cnothing good could come out of Nazareth.\u201d He said, \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach good news\u201d \u2014 evangel \u2014\u201dto the poor.\u201d That\u2019s what evangelicalism is to Jesus. That\u2019s the kind of evangelicalism that I embrace. You\u2019ve had health challenges over the years. How do you keep going year after year and keep yourself from being burned out? I read the Bible one time, specifically looking to see if I could find any person in scripture that God used in a major way that did not have some physical challenge. And I couldn\u2019t find it. That helped me get over any pity party. You know, Moses couldn\u2019t talk. Ezekiel had strange post-traumatic syndrome types of emotional issues. Jeremiah was crying all the time from his struggles with depression. Paul had a physical thorn in the flesh. Jesus was acquainted with sorrow. Then then I looked down through history, and I couldn\u2019t find anybody.  Harriet Tubman had epileptic-type fits. Martin Luther King was stabbed before he did the March on Washington and had a breathing disorder after that. During covid, I thought deeply about death and mortality. I have some immune deficiencies and challenges. I\u2019ve battled this ankylosing spondylitis for now 40-plus years. At any time, it could shut my body down. During covid, as I kept meeting people, I sat down one day and I said, Lord, why am I still here? I\u2019m not better than these people. I know I\u2019ve been around covid. My doctor said to me if I caught covid I probably would not fare well. As I was musing one day, it dawned on me. That\u2019s the wrong question. The question is never, why are you still alive? Why are you still breathing? The question is what are you going to do with the breath you have? Because at any given moment, the scripture says we\u2019re a step from death. And so I\u2019ve decided that whatever breath I have, it is too precious to waste on hate, on oppression and on being mean to people. It\u2019s only to be used for the cause of justice.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is igniting his White House bid at a moment of unprecedented peril in the criminal investigations against him \u2013 a confluence that could send America into a new political and legal collision. Trump\u2019s wild rhetoric at his first official 2024 campaign rally Saturday previewed the divisive national moment ahead should he be indicted in any of multiple criminal probes. As he whipped up a demagogic fervor in Waco, Texas, to try to secure a new presidency dedicated to \u201cretribution,\u201d Trump\u2019s extremism \u2013 laced with suggestions of violence \u2013 left no doubt he would be willing to take the country to a dark place to save himself. Yet Trump\u2019s chilling warnings that the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cthugs and criminals\u201d have created a \u201cStalinist Russia horror show\u201d by \u201cweaponizing\u201d justice against him also spelled electoral danger for a GOP hurt by his authoritarianism in recent elections. An extraordinary prolonged character attack on Ron DeSantis, in which Trump depicted his biggest potential rival of 2024 tearfully begging for his endorsement in 2018, demonstrated the political firestorm the Florida governor will have to deal with if he jumps into the White House campaign. Trump baselessly rails against 'prosecutorial misconduct' at Waco rally as investigations loom Even with the ex-president\u2019s reputation for hyperbole and inflammatory rhetoric, such demagoguery has never previously been heard in the first official rally of any modern American election campaign. Meanwhile, House committee chairs eager to appeal to the Trump base are increasing their efforts to use the power of their Republican majority to thwart Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s inquiry into Trump \u2013 even before it releases any possible indictment or evidence. House Oversight Chair James Comer told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that the GOP moves were justified because the investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged role in a hush money scheme to pay an adult film actress was based purely on politics. \u201cThis is the, for better or worse, leading contender for the Republican nomination of the presidential election next year, as well as a former president of the United States,\u201d the Kentucky Republican told Jake Tapper. Many legal experts have questioned whether the potential Bragg investigation will produce the strongest of cases against Trump, who\u2019s also facing several other probes over his actions around the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents. (Trump, who maintains he\u2019s done nothing wrong, so far has not been charged in any of the criminal probes against him.) And given the greater national impact of those other investigations, a possible attempt to use a business accounting violation in this yearslong hush money case to suggest a possible violation of campaign finance law could be especially controversial. Yet Comer\u2019s comments also created the implication that an ex-president or White House candidate could be protected from investigation even if they had committed a criminal offense. This gets to the core of the possible cases against Trump: Would failing to investigate him and charge him, if the evidence justifies such a step, mean an ex-president is above the law? Or would some attempts to call him to account risk subjecting him to a level of scrutiny that other citizens might not face? Comer and House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, who were among the three committee chairs writing to Bragg this weekend with intensifying demands for his testimony, won a warm shout-out from Trump at his rally in Texas, reflecting the way the new House GOP is acting as a political tool for the ex-president and his radical campaign. Bragg responded to the chairmen in a statement saying it was not appropriate for Congress to interfere with local investigations and vowed to be guided by the rule of law. He was backed up this weekend by nearly 200 former federal prosecutors who wrote a letter denouncing efforts to intimidate him. House committee chairmen double down on Manhattan DA oversight efforts The grand jury in the Trump case is expected to reconvene on Monday, following a week of rampant public speculation over whether Bragg would call more witnesses and whether the case was sufficiently serious to merit the potential first indictment ever of an ex-president. Trump falsely predicted earlier this month that he would be arrested last Tuesday \u2013 a move that fired up an effort by his allies to intimidate Bragg. But the week came and went without any indictment news. CNN reported last week that the district attorney\u2019s office was trying to determine whether to call back Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to refute the testimony provided by attorney Robert Costello, who appeared at the request of Trump lawyers \u2013 or to call an additional witness to buttress its case before the grand jurors consider a vote on whether to indict the former president. The escalating confrontation over Bragg\u2019s inquiry came as other investigations around Trump seemed to be nearing their own conclusions. In a totally separate case on Friday, Trump\u2019s primary defense attorney, Evan Corcoran, appeared before a grand jury in Washington, DC, that is hearing evidence over the ex-president\u2019s handling of classified documents at his home in Florida, including possible obstruction of justice when the government tried to get those documents back. Prosecutors have made clear in court proceedings that are still under seal that they believe Trump tried to use Corcoran to advance a crime. Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Friday that Corcoran\u2019s appearance represented a serious development for Trump. \u201cThat is an unprecedented thing that we\u2019re seeing, and Evan Corcoran is in a position to provide unbelievably damaging testimony against him,\u201d he said. Judge says several Trump aides, including former chief of staff, must testify to Jan. 6 grand jury Besides looking into the documents issue, special counsel Jack Smith is investigating Trump\u2019s conduct around the 2020 election \u2013 which even this weekend the former president again falsely claimed he had won \u2013 and in the run-up to the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. In another probe related to the 2020 election, a district attorney in Georgia said at the end of January that decisions were \u201cimminent\u201d in the investigation into Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the key swing state. CNN reported last week that prosecutors are considering bringing racketeering and conspiracy charges. Charges in any one of these investigations would test the strength of the country\u2019s political and judicial institutions, given that an ex-president and current presidential candidate is involved. And the fact that Trump is showing such willingness to inflame the country\u2019s politics in his own defense makes this a deeply serious moment for the nation. Trump\u2019s fiery rally in Waco pulsated with falsehoods about the 2020 election and his one-term presidency and misrepresented the legal cases against him. Coming a day after he warned in a social media post about \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d if he is indicted, his speech boiled with conspiracy theories and personal resentments \u2013 rhetoric that is especially dangerous in the aftermath of January 6. It wasn\u2019t lost on observers that his event coincided with the 30th anniversary of a law enforcement raid on a cult compound in Waco that\u2019s seen on the far right as a symbol of government overreach, although the campaign maintained the location had been chosen for convenience. The ex-president has often used extremist speeches to try to get more time in the limelight or more attention, whether from adoring onlookers or outraged critics. It is too early to judge how well his tactic is working in the 2024 campaign and as his legal plight seems to worsen. To date, there have been no big protests of the kind Trump has repeatedly called for. The price his supporters could pay for turning violent has also been demonstrated by the hundreds of convictions of those who invaded the Capitol more than two years ago after his big Washington rally. So there is at least the possibility that while Trump remains widely popular with his GOP base, his angry rhetoric lacks the power that it once did. Fact check: Trump repeats false claims during rally in Waco, Texas But it is also clear after this first campaign rally that Trump, who is still leading the Republican pack for 2024, has crossed a new political line. He is painting a picture of a decrepit and powerless nation \u2013 plagued by corruption, rigged elections and the criminal manipulation of the law against his supporters \u2013 that is far more extreme than the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d he invoked in his inaugural address in 2017. \u201cThe abuses of power that are currently with us at all levels of government will go down as among the most shameful, corrupt and depraved chapters in all of American history,\u201d Trump said, lashing the US as a \u201cthird world banana republic.\u201d \u201cEither the deep state destroys America, or we destroy the deep state,\u201d he said at one point. And while Trump\u2019s intent is to shock, history suggests that authoritarians seeking power follow exactly the same playbook of populist nationalism \u2013 discrediting free elections, demonizing the legal system and taking aim at vulnerable sectors of society \u2013 that Trump is pioneering in his new campaign. His rally was also notable for the fact that it was almost totally dominated by his grievances and complaints, which may well hint at a sense of foreboding over his legal position. \u201cEvery piece of my personal life, financial life, business life and public life has been turned upside down and dissected like no one in the history of our country,\u201d Trump said. This raises a question of whether he\u2019s offering a message, rooted in his obsessions, that a majority of Republican voters would actually want to sign up for, even those who considered his presidency a success. In 2016, Trump emerged as an unlikely but highly skilled vehicle for the conservative grassroots, much of which felt patronized by politicians and left behind in a wave of globalization that sent millions of blue-collar jobs overseas. DeSantis may be trying something similar in 2024. In the early moves of his yet-to-be-declared campaign, the Florida governor has positioned himself as the champion of conservative voters who believe their way of life is under attack from liberals and multiculturalists pushing a \u201cwoke\u201d ideology. One of the key questions of the GOP primary campaign will be whether this approach could appeal to more Republican voters than Trump\u2019s incessant attempts to portray investigations into him as a symptom of a wider attack by a corrupt government on his followers. But ahead of yet another potentially pivotal week, Trump is proving that he will not turn away from the defining tactic of his political career: subjecting the country\u2019s institutions to ever more intense and unprecedented stress tests.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump says he\u2019d end the war in Ukraine in one day and avert World War III, while Ron DeSantis is keener on waging a culture war than a proxy one to save a foreign democracy. The ex-president and the Florida governor\u2019s escalating shadow campaign for the 2024 Republican nomination is likely to exacerbate the already growing antipathy among grassroots conservatives for being Ukraine\u2019s arsenal of democracy. This should worry the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has profusely thanked Americans for their multi-billion dollar generosity while warning he will keep asking for more. A bitter Republican primary that turns on the isolationist sentiment of the party\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d wing could produce a nominee, and possibly a 47th president, who could shelve the assurance of Joe Biden that Americans will stand by Ukraine \u201cfor as long as it takes.\u201d There are already early signs of ebbing public support for Biden\u2019s repeated aid and arms packages for Ukraine a year after Russia\u2019s brutal and unprovoked invasion. And House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally, has warned against a \u201cblank check\u201d for Ukraine. The reaction of the ex-president\u2019s proteges in the GOP-controlled House to Biden\u2019s daring secret visit to Kyiv last month suggests that the 2024 Republican nominee will surely cater to a base that believes the US should spend its money securing its own borders instead of Ukraine\u2019s and that Biden cares more for foreigners than Americans. Trump and DeSantis stake out sharpest preview yet of possible 2024 showdown Recent polling helps explain the GOP positioning on Ukraine. Support for the US providing weapons to the country has decreased compared with last spring, according to an AP-NORC survey conducted in late January, and that decline was sharper among Republicans \u2013 down to 39% from 53% in May 2022. Trump has no love lost for Zelensky, after what he misleading described as their \u201cperfect\u201d 2019 phone call, in which the then-president tried to use US military aid to extort his counterpart into opening an investigation into Biden. The incident led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment. More recently, in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, Trump seemed eager to rekindle his genuflecting relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom much of the world now regards as a war criminal. And the need to defend a democracy that is under attack is a foreign concept to Trump at home, let alone abroad. \u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled. \u2026 I will get the problem solved. And I will get it solved in rapid order and it will take me no longer than one day,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know exactly what to say to each of them,\u201d he added, before hinting at a potential strategy of siding with the aggressor in the war by reminding his audience, \u201cI got along very well with Putin.\u201d DeSantis, whose foreign policy views remain mostly a mystery, has not been as clear as Trump on what he would do in Ukraine. After all, he\u2019s not even a declared candidate yet, despite fresh signs he is heading in that direction. But he appeared to try to catch up with Trump when warning in a recent Fox News interview that the Biden administration had \u201cno clear, strategic objective identified\u201d in Ukraine and that it was not in US interests to get involved in a proxy war with China there, after the White House warned Beijing could start sending arms to Russia. This is an evolution from his position as a congressman in 2014 and 2015, when he strongly supported arming Ukraine to fight Russia, CNN\u2019s KFile reported. GOP 2024 hopefuls divided over US role in Ukraine war Putin, of course, is listening. The Russian leader appears to be digging in for a forever war in Ukraine \u2013 where he has already been entrenched since 2014 after the illegal annexation of Crimea. Even hints that a new Republican president would cut Kyiv loose would play into his apparent belief that, eventually, the West will get tired and splinter. After all, Germany only agreed to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine after Biden also agreed that more advanced US M1 Abrams tanks would also be shipped to the battlefield. And even if Kyiv prevails in the conflict, or reaches a currently unlikely peace deal with Moscow, its future could rely on being a de facto NATO protectorate armed with Western weapons and even security guarantees from major US or European powers that some future Republican presidents, judging by current rhetoric, might be loath to honor. Not every Republican agrees with Trump or DeSantis on Ukraine. Many of the key committee chairmen in the House, for instance, back current or even increased aid and military hardware for Ukraine and support its call for F-16 fighter jets that Biden has declined to send. And several potential Republican primary candidates also support the US effort. Former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who launched her campaign last month and paints herself as a would-be scourge of strongmen leaders like Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping, tweeted last year: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a war for Ukraine, this is a war for freedom.\u201d But presidential primaries have a habit of defining a party\u2019s positions at the extremes \u2013 and with Trump and DeSantis being seen as the current favorites, their rivals may come under increasing pressure to fall into line to ensure their own political viability. Ukraine\u2019s primary focus is on the battle, amid fresh signs that its desperate resistance in the city of Bakhmut may be about to be broken. But the possibility of changing political conditions in the United States as a new White House campaign begins means that Zelensky\u2019s desperation for more weapons and ammunition to eject Putin\u2019s forces from Ukraine will only become more urgent. Trump made clear in his appearance at CPAC that if he gets the chance to confront Biden in a repeat of the 2020 election, he will accuse the Democrat of leading the planet to the brink of disaster. \u201cI am the only candidate who can make this promise, I will prevent, very easily, World War III,\u201d Trump said in a speech riddled with falsehoods. \u201cWe are going to have World War III, by the way, if something doesn\u2019t happen fast.\u201d The former president is in some ways repeating his 2016 tactic of warning about America\u2019s exposure to foreign wars. He\u2019s trying to fan fatigue over US arms-length involvement in Ukraine as he did over the long conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. And he drove home another familiar criticism of presidents who fixate on foreign policy by showing up in East Palestine, Ohio \u2013 at the site of a chemical spill after a freight train derailment \u2013 while Biden was visiting Europe last month. \u201cI sincerely hope that when your representatives and all of the politicians get here, including Biden, they get back from touring Ukraine, that he\u2019s got some money left over,\u201d Trump said. CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes reported Monday that the former president also sees an opening to target DeSantis over his calls as a congressional candidate in 2012 to privatize some social benefits by suggesting he is not sufficiently in line with the GOP base in stopping financial and military aid to Ukraine. \u201cWe are never going back to a party that wants to give unlimited money to fight foreign endless wars but demands we cut veteran benefits and retirement benefits at home,\u201d Trump said during his CPAC speech. In his new book \u201cThe Courage to be Free,\u201d published last week, the Florida governor doesn\u2019t mention Ukraine. But he does criticize the mantra laid out by President George W. Bush in his second inaugural address \u2013 that \u201cthe survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the liberty in other lands.\u201d DeSantis writes that this \u201cmessianic impulse\u2014that the US had both the right and the obligation to promote democracy, by force, if necessary, around the world \u2014 was grounded in Wilsonian moralism, not in a clear-eyed view of American interests.\u201d This perspective seems incompatible with Biden\u2019s characterization of the US\u2019 support for Ukraine as part of a vital national interest to protect democracy. DeSantis agenda -- and potential campaign platform -- in the spotlight as Florida lawmakers return to work But DeSantis is tapping into a familiar seam of opinion. The sense among many voters that Bush overreached and led Americans into disastrous years-long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was not just a motivating force that helped the rise of Trump\u2019s populist nationalism in the Republican Party. President Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 2008 warning that he was against \u201cdumb wars.\u201d There is some reluctance to get involved in foreign wars again among American voters on the right and left. A group of Democratic members of Congress, for example, last year called for negotiations to end the war, despite the lack of indications that Putin has any willingness to withdraw his troops. But they were criticized by their colleagues for such a move. And Iraq and Afghanistan are not a clean analogy for Ukraine \u2013 whatever Republican candidates might say \u2013 since Biden has scrupulously avoided the involvement of any US forces, as he seeks to head off a dangerous direct clash with nuclear-armed Moscow. Biden\u2019s need to shore up public support for an extended commitment to Ukraine was one reason why he went to Ukraine to mark the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. \u201cWhen united, Americans of all political backgrounds decided that they would step up. The American people know it matters. Unchecked aggression is a threat to all of us,\u201d Biden told Zelensky in Kyiv. \u201cYou remind us that freedom is priceless; it\u2019s worth fighting for for as long as it takes. And that\u2019s how long we\u2019re going to be with you, Mr. President: for as long as it takes.\u201d But with the battle on the edge of Europe not looking like it will end any time soon, Biden may have to make that case on the debate stage with a Republican nominee next year \u2013 which suggests the clock maybe ticking for Ukraine.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Last year, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia spoke at a white nationalist event organized by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that caused Republican leaders to denounce her. Last week, Greene\u2019s Twitter account was temporarily suspended by the Elon Musk-headed platform over a tweet with a graphic referring to a \u201cTrans Day of Vengeance,\u201d as she denounced a planned transgender rights rally. And come Tuesday, Greene has announced plans to protest in New York City when former President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned on an indictment of more than 30 counts, calling the proceedings against him an \u201cunconstitutional WITCH HUNT!\u201d But on Sunday, Greene was featured on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in an interview the long-running show promoted on Twitter with the tease: \u201cRepublican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, nicknamed MTG, isn\u2019t afraid to share her opinions, no matter how intense and in-your-face they are. She sits down with Lesley Stahl this Sunday on 60 Minutes.\u201d The images attached to this tweet by \u201c60 Minutes\u201d include Greene and Stahl walking through the US Capitol, taking a stroll outside and Greene showing Stahl something on her phone. It's time for Marjorie Taylor Greene to go In the segment that aired Sunday night, Stahl noted the congresswoman had moved from the fringe to the GOP\u2019s front row in two years despite a \u201csharp tongue\u201d and \u201csome pretty radical views\u201d as well as \u201cover the top\u201d comments such as \u201cthe Democrats are a party of pedophiles.\u201d Stahl also referred to video of Greene chasing a Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor, still maintaining that the 2020 election was stolen and failing to criticize Trump over spending. (The interview was conducted before news of his indictment.) But Stahl didn\u2019t mention Greene spoke at a white nationalist event a year ago while a member of Congress or her extreme anti-Muslim views and her defense of January 6 rioters. Criticism of CBS for amplifying Greene has been swift and well-deserved even before the program aired. Former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted beforehand: \u201cWow. Insane that 60 min would do this.\u201d (Kinzinger is a CNN senior political commentator.) Journalist Molly Jong-Fast also slammed \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with the tweet: \u201cAttention is currency and 60 minutes is spending its currency on the Jewish space lasers woman.\u201d (Jong-Fast was apparently referring to Greene\u2019s past claim that a massive California wildfire was started by \u201ca laser\u201d beamed from space controlled by a prominent Jewish banking family.) David Hogg, who survived the 2018 horrific school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has since become an activist against gun violence, responded, \u201cI look forward to your questions about why she thinks school shootings are fake and why she\u2019s supported QAnon.\u201d Trump's risky call for protests Greene amplified the conspiracy theory \u2014 two years before being elected to Congress \u2014 that the Parkland shooting that took 17 lives was staged. And in 2019, Greene appeared on video confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a \u201ccoward.\u201d She also called Hogg \u201c#littleHitler\u201d on social media. Greene\u2019s own tweet promoting Sunday\u2019s segment was not filled with her typical smears of \u201cfake news\u201d when she doesn\u2019t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised \u201c60 Minutes\u201d host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): \u201cIt was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.\u201d Greene added, \u201cLeslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism. And while we may disagree on some issues, I respect her greatly.\u201d Now, it is true that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d over its 50-plus-year history has featured what the show has dubbed \u201ccontroversial\u201d guests. These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose 1995 terrorist attack left 168 dead, including 19 children. And the show did a 1979 interview with Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Perhaps \u201c60 Minutes\u201d views Greene \u2014 who has repeatedly downplayed and even defended the January 6, 2021, attack plus called for the GOP to become the party of \u201cChristian nationalism\u201d \u2014 in the vein of its long list of controversial guests. (CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.)  However, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the comments of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump\u2019s candidacy \u201cmay not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS.\u201d Moonves added, \u201cThe money\u2019s rolling in and this is fun. \u2026 (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,\u201d concluding, \u201cSorry. It\u2019s a terrible thing to say. But bring it on, Donald. Keep going.\u201d Moonves may be gone from CBS, but it appears his mindset continues at \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d And that may be good for \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d but it\u2019s definitely not good for America.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. A national spotlight is once again on the Proud Boys. Five members of the violent, far-right group are on trial in Washington, DC, facing a raft of federal charges, including seditious conspiracy, for their alleged role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Arguably the most prominent of the defendants is the organization\u2019s national chairman, Henry \u201cEnrique\u201d Tarrio. Tarrio was not present in Washington, DC, on January 6, but prosecutors aim to present his role in the group\u2019s leadership as making him culpable. In a June 2022 release confirming the indictment of Tarrio and the other Proud Boys now on trial, the Department of Justice charged that all five, \u201cdirected, mobilized and led members of the crowd onto the Capitol grounds and into the Capitol, leading to dismantling of metal barricades, destruction of property, breaching of the Capitol building, and assaults on law enforcement. During and after the attack, Tarrio and his co-defendants claimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room.\u201d That a group whose membership includes those \u201cwith ties to white nationalism,\u201d as the FBI has reportedly categorized the Proud Boys, also has people of color not just within its ranks but, as in the case of Tarrio, at the helm, is one of its particular anomalies. The Proud Boys is one of several right-wing groups that gained cultural prominence during the Trump era, with its hallmark displays of aggression (both online and in public) on behalf of Euro-nationalism, promotion of MAGA-oriented alliances and opposition to civil rights for minority groups. The story of how a self-described \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d organization came to be led by an opportunistic Afro-Cuban \u2014 as Tarrio identifies \u2014 reveals the way misogyny, violence, perceived grievance and mainstream political connections coalesced within an elastic extremist group, and across the extreme fringes of the far right. The Proud Boys rode an irreverent Trumpian socio-political backlash after their formation during the 2016 election cycle and found currency among swaths of a polarized yet fragmented male electorate. Its founder Gavin MacInnes, a British-born Canadian grievance-monger and co-founder of Vice Media, created a group defined by brazen nationalism, misogyny and aggressive opposition to \u201cAntifa\u201d socialists, the Black Lives Matter Movement and Muslims, among others. Key to the Proud Boys\u2019 expansion has been an agility to publicly position their \u201cfraternity\u201d around an array of rotating grievances and associated scapegoats. The January 6 insurrection: Minute-by-minute A January 2022 research paper from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland noted that, \u201cWhile the Proud Boys vehemently deny adhering to a racist ideology, the organization is deeply rooted in white nationalism and misogyny.\u201d The Huffington Post editor and author of the new book, \u201cWe Are Proud Boys,\u201d Andy Campbell further explains the group\u2019s seeming contradictions regarding race: \u201cIn the Proud Boys\u2019 early days, founder Gavin McInnes made his views on white supremacy in the group very clear: Anyone can join up, so long as they generally agree that white men were overwhelmingly responsible for the success of Western culture,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cWhile the Proud Boys have white supremacy and bigotry at their core, all of them gather under the banner of political violence in service of the right-wing grievance machine, and that makes for some strange bedfellows.\u201d One of the group\u2019s key initiation rituals involves a member reading this declaration in public and at meetings before being pummeled by five of their peers: \u201cI am a proud western chauvinist who refuses to apologize for creating the modern world.\u201d The Proud Boys\u2019 guidebook \u201cdisavows\u201d Nazis and racists, but since the group\u2019s inception it has routinely marched alongside a who\u2019s who of American extremists, including neo-Nazis and Oath Keepers, at violent public events including anti-Shariah and anti-immigrant protests \u2014 and the January 6 insurrection. And although the group nominally accepts different races, the guidebook is unrelentingly clear about its rigid Euro-supremacy and anti-multicultural stance, calling for its members to \u201crecognize the West is the best.\u201d There's nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man Violence was not merely a buzzword, but has been a key part of the group\u2019s existence. According to the University of Maryland\u2019s START program, 83 Proud Boys and associates have carried out ideological attacks, including 54 defendants involved in January 6 rioting alone. Based on charges filed, that\u2019s the largest number from any extremist group whose members have been identified at the US Capitol that day. Tarrio\u2019s charges connected to the insurrection are not the first time he faced charges in the nation\u2019s capital;  he pleaded guilty to a weapons charge and the destruction of a Black Lives Matter banner from the historic Asbury United Methodist Church in December 2020. And while criminality and machismo have characterized Tarrio\u2019s leadership, they also created the very power vacuum that led to his ascension to chairman. In November 2018, MacInnes resigned from the group. \u201cI am officially disassociating myself from the Proud Boys,\u201d he said in a YouTube video. \u201cIn all capacities, forever, I quit.\u201d His decision came amid a number of swirling controversies \u2014 the previous month, nine Proud Boys were arrested after fighting broke out outside a venue in New York City where MacInnes spoke. Video footage later emerged of some of the group\u2019s members saying homophobic slurs while beating a man on the ground. And just days prior, a damning law enforcement document became public that stated, \u201cProud Boys members have contributed to the recent escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Charlottesville, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.\u201d Soon thereafter, Tarrio assumed the reins of power.  Tarrio\u2019s leadership has been marked by a dramatic escalation of violence employed by the group. And of the 37 \u201cviolent demonstration events\u201d identified by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a non-profit research center, as including the Proud Boys\u2019 participation during 2020, 25 occurred between the presidential election and President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, often aligned with broader \u201cStop the Steal\u201d protests and campaigns. (The group\u2019s notoriety had grown further in September 2020 when then-President Donald Trump addressed them during a presidential debate: \u201cProud Boys, stand back and stand by,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll tell you what, somebody\u2019s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem.\u201d) Tarrio\u2019s slalom down a hill of violence, misogyny and race-baiting, however, may have come to an end, as a jury ponders his role and those that he led in the worst attack on the nation\u2019s Capitol in over a century and one half.",

As many parts of California attempt to recover from colossal amounts of snow\u00a0that trapped mountain communities, more than 16 million people are now under flood watches ahead of a storm set to drench the state Thursday with dangerous amounts of rain. The places that will be impacted \u2013 mostly across central and Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento \u2013 have already been dealt layers of snow from the previous brutal storms. In response to the ominous forecast, many residents in the region have been urged to prepare at least two weeks of essentials ahead of the likely flooding. The impending atmospheric river event won\u2019t be the first this year to lash California. Late last year and into the new year, multiple rounds of heavy rains from atmospheric rivers soaked entire neighborhoods and unleashed mudslides that killed at least 18 people. Two of the four Americans who authorities say were kidnapped in Mexico last week have been found dead, officials said Tuesday. The other two were found alive. The group of friends traveled from South Carolina so one of them \u2013 a mother of six \u2013 could undergo a medical procedure across the border, but they never made it to the appointment. The discovery of the Americans\u2019 whereabouts comes days after the four were targeted by a Mexican cartel that likely mistook them for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official said. Their abduction highlights the ongoing violence that has plagued some Mexican cities during the long-running Mexican drug war as well as the growing business of \u201cmedical tourism.\u201d The US is planning to relax Covid-19 testing restrictions for travelers from China as soon as Friday, a source told CNN. In December, federal health officials announced that, starting January 5, the US would require all travelers from China to show a negative Covid test result before flying to the country after Beijing\u2019s rapid easing of Covid restrictions led to a surge in cases. Those restrictions will be relaxed this week, the source said, citing a decline in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths \u2013 and more data surrounding the variants that were circulating in China. The Biden administration still plans to monitor cases in China and around the world, keeping in place a program that surveys travelers on details around new variants. Voters in Oklahoma will reject a ballot measure that would have legalized recreational marijuana in the state for adults ages 21 and older, CNN projects. The measure in Tuesday\u2019s special election would have allowed for possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the growth of up to six marijuana plants. If it had passed, there would also have been a 15% tax on sales of recreational marijuana in the state. Supporters of the measure argued it would bring in new tax revenue, but critics said it would negatively impact communities. It was one of several ballot measures on cannabis use that has been considered by voters in recent months. Similar measures in November failed in Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota, while voters in Maryland and Missouri passed measures for recreational cannabis use. A dozen senators unveiled bipartisan legislation Tuesday expanding President Joe Biden\u2019s legal authority to ban TikTok nationwide, marking the latest in a string of congressional proposals threatening the social media platform\u2019s future in the country. The legislation specifically aims to give the government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk. The proposed law takes a wide-ranging approach to fears that companies with ties to China could be pressured by that country\u2019s government into handing over Americans\u2019 data. The legislation has \u201csparked a lot of interest\u201d from other senators beyond the 12 co-sponsors and among some members of the House in both parties, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said.

At least 36 people were killed in a train collision Tuesday night in Tempi, central Greece, the Greek Fire Service said. A passenger train was carrying more than 350 people when it collided with a freight train. The two trains involved in the collision were traveling on the same track for many kilometers before the incident occurred, state-owned public broadcaster ERT reported. The passenger train had changed lanes and switched to a cargo track before the collision, according to ERT. The passenger train had been traveling from the capital Athens to Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second-largest city, following a nationwide carnival that took place over the weekend. Scientists say tests in East Palestine, Ohio, show unusually high levels of some chemicals in the aftermath of a toxic train wreck last month. Nine of the dozens of chemicals that the EPA has been monitoring are higher than would normally be found in the area, according to a group of scientists from Texas A&M and Carnegie Mellon University. The highest levels found in the area were of a toxic chemical called acrolein, the analysis says. Acrolein is used to control plants, algae, rodents and microorganisms. It can cause inflammation and irritation of the skin, respiratory tract and mucous membranes, according to the CDC. In response to angry residents, the EPA said it will continue to monitor the air quality in the area and in people\u2019s homes. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot lost her reelection bid Tuesday, marking the first time in more than 30 years that Chicago has ditched its mayor. Lightfoot, the first Black woman and first out gay person to serve as the city\u2019s mayor, failed to make a top-two runoff amid growing concerns about rising crime in Chicago. Paul Vallas, a longtime public schools chief who ran on a tough-on-crime message, and Brandon Johnson, a Cook County commissioner backed by progressives and the Chicago Teachers Union, will advance to the April runoff, CNN projects. More than 507,000 ballots had been cast by the time polls closed Tuesday, Chicago elections officials said. More mail-in votes will be added to that total as they arrive. Vaccine advisers to the FDA narrowly voted Tuesday in favor of Pfizer\u2019s RSV vaccine for adults over the age of 60, paving the way for approval of the nation\u2019s first RSV vaccine, despite some safety concerns. The committee members voted 7-4, with one abstention, that there are adequate data to support the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for the prevention of a lower respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, among older adults. The FDA, which typically follows the independent committee\u2019s recommendations, is scheduled to decide on approval by May, ahead of RSV\u2019s typical winter surge. RSV is a highly contagious virus responsible for an estimated 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths per year among adults 65 or older, according to the CDC. Russian officials today accused Ukraine of launching a spate of attempted drone strikes targeting infrastructure deep inside Russia, including near its capital. Following the alleged attacks, Russia\u2019s second-largest city of St. Petersburg closed its airspace and briefly banned incoming flights on Tuesday, according to state media. Meanwhile, Finland has begun construction of barrier fences on its eastern border with Russia. The Finnish border was one of the few entry points for Russians after many Western countries shut their air space and borders to Russian planes in response to the Ukraine invasion. Helsinki later closed its border at the end of last September when Russians tried to flee President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpartial mobilization\u201d of hundreds of thousands of citizens to fight in the war.

February 3, 2009 - Is sworn in as attorney general of the United States by Vice President Joe Biden. February 18, 2009 - In his first major speech since being confirmed, Holder makes a controversial remark calling the United States a \u201cnation of cowards\u201d for not discussing race relations. October 4, 2011 - The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee calls for an investigation into whether Holder was honest when testifying earlier in the year about his knowledge of Operation Fast and Furious. The controversial operation, run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was supposed to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, more than 1,000 weapons were lost track of and two lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 murder of US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. October 12, 2011 - The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issues a subpoena for communications from Holder and other Justice Department officials relating to Operation Fast and Furious.

This is the first time in US history that the head of the Justice Department has been held in contempt of Congress. June 29, 2012 - The White House announces that Holder will not face criminal prosecution under the contempt of Congress citation. President Obama\u2019s assertion of executive privilege in the case prevents a criminal prosecution.

            "article_content": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has a message for his fellow Republicans looking to win back the White House: \u201cWe cannot get distracted.\u201d \u201cWe have to tell people, No. 1, what we\u2019re for. No. 2, that we\u2019re going to be focused on the future and what we\u2019re going to do for the voters in our state or the American people. And then, No. 3, we have to do a simple thing: We have to win,\u201d Kemp told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The governor\u2019s remarks came a day after he\u2019d told donors at a Republican National Committee retreat in Nashville that the GOP needed to move on from the 2020 presidential election. In his speech, Kemp offered a thinly veiled dig at former President Donald Trump and his continued election grievances, without naming him, saying, \u201cNot a single swing voter will vote for our nominee if they choose to talk about the 2020 election being stolen.\u201d Trump, currently seen as the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination, has repeatedly argued since leaving office that Republicans cannot succeed \u2013 either at the ballot box or legislatively \u2013 if they turn a blind eye to the past. But candidates who backed his false election claims did poorly in the midterm elections last fall in key swing states Trump will need to win back the White House in 2024. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp urges Republicans to move on from election fraud claims: '2020 is ancient history' Trump is also under a cloud of legal woes. In New York, a hush money payment to an adult-film star shortly before the 2016 election has resulted in his  indictment by a Manhattan grand jury over his alleged role in the scheme. And in Atlanta, a select grand jury has investigated efforts by Trump and allies to overturn his election loss in Georgia in 2020. \u201cI can\u2019t control what the judicial branch is doing or what a local prosecutor is doing in many ways, but what we can control \u2026 is what we\u2019re focused on,\u201d Kemp said Sunday. \u201cIf we get distracted and talk about other things that the Democrats want to talk about, like these investigations \u2013 regardless of what you think about the politics of those \u2013 if we get distracted every day and let the media just talk about that, that only helps Joe Biden,\u201d he added. \u201cIt does not give us a path for Republicans to win.\u201d Asked by Tapper if Trump was unelectable nationwide, Kemp demurred. \u201cThat\u2019s for the people to decide,\u201d he said. Tension between Trump and Kemp has been simmering for years. When Kemp refused to overturn Biden\u2019s 2020 win in Georgia, Trump made the governor his No. 1 enemy, publicly railing against him throughout 2021 and recruiting former US Sen. David Perdue to challenge Kemp in a GOP primary. Through it all, Trump failed to draw Kemp into a fight, and the governor won his 2022 primary overwhelmingly before handily defeating Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams in the November general election. Kemp said Sunday that Republicans will need to draw a distinction with what he referred to as \u201cthe disaster of the Biden administration\u201d to win next year, pointing to border security, high inflation and energy policy. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a lot of good candidates that, if they focus on those things, we have got a great chance of winning the White House in 2024,\u201d the governor said.",

            "article_content": "Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has announced that he\u2019s running for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, launching a challenge to former President Donald Trump, who remains the front-runner despite his looming criminal indictment. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that people want leaders that appeal to the best of America, and not simply appeal to our worst instincts,\u201d Hutchinson, 72, said in an interview on ABC News that aired Sunday. He will make a formal announcement on April 26 in his hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, according to a news release. The GOP primary field is still in its early stages. Trump announced a third presidential campaign last year, while Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations, became the first major rival to challenge him when she announced her bid in February. A number of other Republicans, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence, have been making moves suggesting they are considering presidential bids. Hutchinson in his announcement doubled down on his call for Trump to drop out of the race now that the former president is facing criminal charges. \u201cThe office is more important than any individual person. So for the sake of the office of the presidency, I do think that\u2019s too much of a sideshow and distraction,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cHe needs to be able to concentrate on his due process.\u201d Asked why he hasn\u2019t joined the chorus of Republicans attacking Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for indicting Trump, Hutchinson said that, while he didn\u2019t agree with Bragg\u2019s decision, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to erode confidence in our entire criminal justice system simply because we don\u2019t like the beginning parts of the case.\u201d Comparing himself with those critics, Hutchinson declared, \u201cI\u2019m different.\u201d The former governor previewed his pitch to voters, arguing that the swirl of uncertainty around Trump, along with the substance of the allegations against him in multiple jurisdictions, \u201cshould give Americans pause.\u201d And, he argued, it should give his underdog campaign a shot. \u201cThis is one of the most unpredictable political environment that I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cSo my message of experience, of consistent conservatism, of hope for our future and solving problems that face Americans, I think that resonates.\u201d Hutchinson ended his tenure as Arkansas governor in early January, limited from seeking a third term but freeing him up to pursue a bid for the White House. On his last day in office, he traveled to Iowa, the first Republican contest of the 2024 calendar, and has since ramped up visits to other crucial early voting states. A frequent critic of Trump, he has hinted at a potential presidential run for months, with repeated calls for a new direction for the GOP. \u201cI actually think more voices right now in opposition or providing an alternative to Donald Trump is the best thing in the right direction,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash last month. Following Trump\u2019s indictment by a Manhattan grand jury last week, Hutchinson has been the rare Republican to call on the former president to drop out of the 2024 race, telling CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Friday that the case was a \u201cbig distraction.\u201d Some Republican strategists say a crowded 2024 primary field would be advantageous to Trump, who still enjoys significant support among the party base, and could splinter the anti-Trump vote, allowing the former president to walk away with the nomination. But Hutchinson has repeatedly maintained that a large field early in the competition would ultimately be good for the party. \u201cIn the early stages, multiple candidates that have an alternative vision to what the president has is good for our party, good for the debate, good for the upcoming debate that will be in August,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN last month. \u201cSo, sure, that will narrow, and it will probably narrow fairly quickly. We need to have a lot of self-evaluation as you go along, but I think more voices now that provide alternative messages and problem-solving and ideas is good for our party,\u201d he added. Though not widely known nationally, Hutchinson has had an extensive career in government \u2013 serving previously as a federal prosecutor, a member of Congress, and in the George W. Bush administration, all before his election as governor in 2014. As governor, Hutchinson oversaw the enactment of tax cuts and legislation that instituted a near-total ban on abortion once Roe v. Wade was overturned, expanded computer science education in schools, and overhauled the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion program. During his tenure, he sometimes butted heads with the Republican-controlled legislature, including when he vetoed a bill in 2021 that banned gender-affirming treatment for anyone under the age of 18. Explaining his veto, Hutchinson called the bill \u201cvast government overreach.\u201d The legislature ended up overriding his veto. He signed the abortion ban that same year but said that he would have preferred if the bill provided exceptions for cases of rape or incest. In what may differentiate him from other Republican candidates, as governor, Hutchinson did not downplay the coronavirus when the pandemic hit the US. He encouraged his constituents to get the vaccine but objected to the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine mandates. While he approved a statewide ban on face masks mandates, he later said he regretted doing so. Born and raised in Arkansas, Hutchinson received an accounting degree from Bob Jones University in South Carolina and graduated from University of Arkansas law school. President Ronald Reagan tapped him to be the US attorney for the Western District of Arkansas in 1982, making him the youngest federal prosecutor at the time at 31. He served in that role until 1985, gaining prominence for his prosecution of a dangerous White supremacist group when he donned a bulletproof vest to help the FBI end a standoff with the group. After losing bids for US Senate in 1986 and for Arkansas attorney general in 1990, Hutchison was elected to the US House of Representatives in 1996 from the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. He succeeded his brother, Tim, who was elected to the US Senate. In the House, Hutchinson served as one of the GOP managers for the 1999 impeachment trial of fellow Arkansan Bill Clinton, making the case that the Democratic president had committed perjury and obstruction of justice. Clinton was ultimately acquitted by the Senate on both articles of impeachment. Hutchinson resigned from Congress in 2001 to serve as Bush\u2019s head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2003, he began a three-year stint in the Department of Homeland Security, serving as undersecretary for border and transportation secretary. Hutchinson lost a bid for Arkansas governor in 2006. Following the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, he was appointed by the National Rifle Association to investigate school safety and how to improve it as part of the gun lobby\u2019s school safety initiative. In 2014, he won his first of two terms as Arkansas governor, as the state solidified its move to the right. This story has been updated with additional information.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump continues to wield enormous power on Capitol Hill as House Republicans seek to curry favor with the former president, pursuing his fixations through their investigations and routinely updating him and his closest advisers on their progress. A number of top House GOP lawmakers have disclosed in recent days their efforts to keep the former president informed on the pace and substance of their investigations. Lines of communication appear to go both ways. Not only are Trump, his aides and close allies regularly apprised of Republicans\u2019 committee work, they also at times exert influence over it, multiple people familiar with the talks tell CNN. The constant, and sometimes direct, communication between Trump and the committees has emerged as a crucial method for Trump to shape Republicans\u2019 priorities in their newly-won House majority. It also underscores the extraordinary sway an ex-president still holds over his party\u2019s lawmakers and the deference many still afford him. That dynamic has been on full display over the past week, as top House Republicans attempted to intervene in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s investigation of hush money payments Trump allegedly made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. That\u2019s led to an acrimonious back and forth between three powerful Republican committee chairs and Bragg over what, if any, jurisdiction Congress has over the DA\u2019s work. House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, has become a key point person for Trump on Hill investigations. The New York Republican talks to Trump roughly once a week, and often more, frequently briefing him on the House committees\u2019 work, three sources familiar with their conversations tell CNN. Trump often calls her as well, the sources said. Comer on whether House GOP will subpoena AG Bragg Stefanik and Trump spoke several times last week alone, where she walked him through the GOP\u2019s plans for an aggressive response to Bragg. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who serves on the House Oversight Committee, which is conducting a number of investigations into President Joe Biden, also speaks to Trump on a frequent basis. Both she and Stefanik have endorsed Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential bid and are said to be interested in serving as his running mate. \u201cI keep him up on everything that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Greene told CNN. \u201cHe seems very plugged in at all times. Sometimes I\u2019m shocked at how he knows all these things. I\u2019m like, \u2018How do you know all this stuff?\u2019\u201d Multiple sources tell CNN that Trump and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan speak regularly but declined to divulge whether those conversations included Jordan\u2019s investigative efforts. \u201cConversations among concerned parties about issues facing the country are not news and regular order in Congress,\u201d Jordan\u2019s spokesperson Russell Dye said in a statement to CNN. Trump, meanwhile, has been regularly briefed on the work of House Oversight Chairman James Comer, but the Kentucky Republican said the two have not spoken since the 2020 presidential election. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Trump since he was President\u201d Comer told CNN. \u201cNow, I talk to former people that used to work for Trump every now and then. But not about Trump.\u201d A source close to Comer added he communicates with \u201ca variety of outside groups, associations and interested parties about the Oversight Committee\u2019s work.\u201d At his rally in Waco, Texas on Saturday, Trump publicly thanked Comer and Jordan, saying Comer \u201chas become a great star.\u201d House GOP uses its new power in extraordinary effort to shield Trump from indictment The decision of what to investigate also underscores the extent to which Republican-led committees are willing to act as a shield for the embattled former president, as well as attempt to inflict damage on Biden ahead of the 2024 presidential election. That includes launching a probe into the House Select Committee that investigated January 6, investigating GOP allegations of Biden family influence peddling, and dropping investigations into foreign spending at Trump-owned properties. Trump\u2019s influence on House Republicans has been particularly telling in the way they have gone after Bragg in recent days. After Trump on March 18 suggested his arrest was imminent, two days later, Jordan, Comer and Bryan Steil, chair of House Administration Committee, sent a letter to Bragg calling for him to sit down for a transcribed interview with their panels \u2014 a move that multiple sources familiar with the letter said was prompted by Speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s public condemnation of Bragg\u2019s case. The request came after Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina sent a letter to Jordan last month asking him to investigate Bragg\u2019s \u201cegregious abuse of power,\u201d The New York Times first reported and CNN confirmed. When Trump isn\u2019t communicating directly with House Republicans himself, he is often doing so through a few top advisers, including those on his payroll and former aides who are still loyal to him, sources tell CNN. Boris Epshteyn, in-house counsel and senior adviser for Trump who is helping coordinate the former president\u2019s legal strategy, has been at the center of the communications, four people familiar with the talks tell CNN. Epshteyn frequently interacts with committee staff, counsel to the chairmen, members of the committee and aides to House leadership, sources said. Epshteyn\u2019s role in the discussions range from being briefed on their work to the pace of the investigations. Brian Jack, a former Trump administration official who joined McCarthy\u2019s team in 2021 to lead his political operation, has also served as a crucial communicator between Trumpworld and the Speaker\u2019s office, multiple source familiar his role said. Jack, who remains an adviser to McCarthy, recently began working on Trump\u2019s 2024 reelection campaign. Jack is less involved in communications with the committees themselves, the sources said, but given his role in both McCarthy\u2019s and Trump\u2019s orbit, he\u2019s often the go-to for advice on how to strategize efforts between the Hill and Trump\u2019s team. Multiple sources familiar with the backchanneling say much of the talks are less about putting pressure on the committees \u2013 as members already know how to maximize their defense of Trump \u2013 and more about ensuring Trump\u2019s team is on the same page as congressional Republicans. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have to tell House GOP committees to investigate, they already are doing investigations that play into Trump\u2019s base and issues: Big Tech censorship, border, Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals, and weaponization of the federal government,\u201d a senior House GOP aide told CNN. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Members on key investigative committees also keep in regular contact with Trump-aligned grassroots groups about investigations. Some of those groups have grown frustrated in recent weeks with how the House panels are conducting their work, including the time it took to hire individuals and get the investigative work started, multiple sources familiar with the matter said. GOP Rep. Dan Bishop, who serves on the weaponization subpanel, told CNN, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from outside groups a fair amount about ideas and recommendations.\u201d Heritage Foundation president Dr. Kevin Roberts said in a statement to CNN, \u201cConservatives have high expectations for these committees to begin the process of de-weaponizing the federal government because the very fabric of our society is at stake.\u201d Fact check: Trump repeats false claims during rally in Waco, Texas A number of these Trump-affiliated groups have urged the GOP-led committees to move more aggressively against Biden. \u201cWe can\u2019t have two years of hearings and then a report,\u201d President of Judicial Watch Tom Fitton told CNN, referring to the pressure his group has placed on Congress to act immediately on the abuses of power that he sees happening, including \u201ccensoring Americans and trying to jail those who are perceived as political opponents.\u201d Fitton said he has appreciated how House Republicans have updated the public on an \u201congoing basis as opposed to just sitting on material\u201d and added \u201cif they don\u2019t seem to be going in the right direction, there will be some pushback.\u201d A number of other Trump-affiliated groups have urged GOP-led committees to move more aggressively against Biden. That includes the Conservative Partnership Institute, run by former GOP Sen. Jim DeMint and now home to Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows, and the Center for Renewing America, run by Trump\u2019s former Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought. Staffers close to Jordan are in regular communication with outside groups, and to assuage the tensions that have arisen at times, they have explained that investigations take time to build, according to multiple sources familiar with the communications. \u201cI\u2019ve been raising holy hell because this weaponization committee has been structured to fail from Day One,\u201d said Mike Davis, a former top aide to Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and founder of the Article III Project, which advocates for \u201cconstitutionalist judges.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve known since November that we were going to have these committees,\u201d said Davis. \u201cAnd they\u2019re just now starting to get their act together.\u201d Davis added that he has spoken at length with many of the outside groups about their concerns \u2013 though he has recently praised Jordan for calling on Bragg to testify, calling it \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d and even tweeted a number of times in support of Jordan.

            "article_content": "House Republicans had hoped to use their annual retreat to get on the same page about upcoming policy battles and devise a strategy to preserve their fragile majority. Instead, they find themselves playing defense for former President Donald Trump. While most Republicans had hoped to steer clear of any presidential politics \u2013 despite being in Florida, home to two major potential GOP rivals in 2024 \u2013 Trump\u2019s announcement over the weekend that he expects to be imminently arrested has put him back in the center of the conversation and forced Republicans to publicly rally to his side. Even some GOP lawmakers who have called for the party to move on from Trump have lined up to offer their full-throated defense of the ex-president, attacking the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office that is investigating Trump as a political witch hunt. Speaker Kevin McCarthy, echoing calls from inside his conference, has instructed GOP-led committees to investigate whether the Manhattan DA used federal funds to probe a payment made by Trump\u2019s then-personal attorney Michael Cohen to adult film star Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 presidential election. McCarthy said Sunday that he already talked to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, about an investigation into the matter, and hinted that there could be more developments on that front soon. \u201cRemember, we also have a select committee on the weaponization of government, this applies directly to that. I think you\u2019ll see actions from them,\u201d McCarthy told reporters at a news conference kicking off their three-day policy retreat. But Republicans weren\u2019t in complete lockstep with Trump. McCarthy carefully broke with Trump\u2019s calls to protest and \u201ctake our nation back\u201d if he is arrested, which has sparked concerns of political violence reminiscent of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. \u201cI don\u2019t think people should protest this, no,\u201d McCarthy said. But he added: \u201cYou may misinterpret when President Trump talks \u2026 he is not talking in a harmful way, and nobody should. Nobody should harm one another \u2026 We want calmness.\u201d Manhattan DA says his office won't tolerate 'attempts to intimidate' following Trump posts Firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, however, offered a different take. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with calling for protests,\u201d she told reporters after the news conference on Sunday. \u201cAmericans have the right to assemble and the right to protest. And that\u2019s an important constitutional right. And he doesn\u2019t have to say \u2018peaceful\u2019 for it to mean peaceful. Of course he means peaceful.\u201d The latest Trump drama is once again threatening to divide the GOP and overshadow their carefully-laid messaging plans \u2013 a familiar predicament for Republicans who served in Congress while Trump was in office and spent years being forced to answer for his regular controversies. Republican leaders who had hoped to focus on their legislative agenda during the first news conference of their policy retreat instead fielded numerous questions from reporters about Trump and the Manhattan DA\u2019s investigation. Asked whether he thinks it would be appropriate for Trump to run for president if he is ultimately convicted, McCarthy said: \u201cHe has a constitutional right to run.\u201d Multiple Republican lawmakers \u2013 including House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik \u2013 have endorsed Trump, while at least two of his staunch supporters have thrown their weight behind other candidates in the race: South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman is backing former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas is supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Most GOP lawmakers, however, have been reluctant to pick sides just yet, waiting to see how the field develops. Even McCarthy, who credited his speakership to Trump, has yet to make his preference known. \u201cI could endorse in the primary, but I haven\u2019t endorsed,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. When pressed on if he will do so, he again repeated: \u201cI could endorse but I haven\u2019t.\u201d Aside from a potentially bruising GOP primary contest, House Republicans have other major internal battles on the horizon. They are about to dive into some of the most complicated and divisive policy fights of their razor-thin majority, including lifting the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, funding the government, reauthorizing federal food stamp programs and deciding whether to continue aid for Ukraine. Part of their goal during their annual retreat is to just get the conference in sync ahead of these looming debates. \u201cThe value of something like this is, can we keep the era of good feelings going within the Republican conference?\u201d said Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who chairs the centrist-leaning Main Street Caucus. \u201cThis is gonna be a nice opportunity for us to just get in the same room, have a couple hundred of us breathe the same air, and remind ourselves that we have more in common than we have apart.\u201d Democratic Arizona senator says there are 'risks involved' in potential Trump indictment While the GOP has notched a handful of victories since taking over the House, including a resolution to overturn a DC crime bill, most of their bills have been messaging endeavors thus far. And even measures that were thought to be low-hanging fruit, like a border security plan, have proved more challenging than expected in their slim majority. House Republicans know their biggest challenges lie ahead. \u201cThe question is really going to be as we get into phase two,\u201d GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who co-leads a bipartisan caucus with Democrats, told CNN. \u201cThe real test is going to be the must-pass pieces of legislation.\u201d The GOP\u2019s investigations on a wide array of subjects, including Hunter Biden\u2019s business deals and the treatment of January 6 defendants, have caused some consternation among the party\u2019s moderates. And some were also skeptical about the need for a congressional response to a potential Trump indictment. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait until I hear more facts and read the indictment itself,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who represents a district President Joe Biden won, told CNN. \u201cI have faith in our legal system. If these charges are political bogus stuff, and they may be, it will become clear enough soon.\u201d GOP leaders are nonetheless expressing confidence in their ability to stay united. \u201cHouse Republicans are working as a team,\u201d House GOP Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota said at the Orlando news conference. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what the American people elected us to do.\u201d Bacon framed the stakes of the legislative fights with Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to come by saying, \u201cWe need to be the governing party that voters trust. This will determine 2024 results. This means we can\u2019t cave to Biden\u2019s and Schumer\u2019s demands, but we can\u2019t refuse to find consensus and make agreements on must pass legislation.\u201d GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, who told CNN he is willing to shut down the government if conservatives do not get what they are calling for pertaining to the debt ceiling, reflected on how House Republicans could learn from their Democratic counterparts in presenting a unified front. \u201cThey\u2019re better than us at the carrot and the stick. If they get in line, they get the carrot. If they don\u2019t, they get the stick. They all tout the unity thing. Maybe that\u2019s one of our weaknesses,\u201d he told CNN. The must-pass pieces of legislation expose not only the fault lines of a slim majority, but also underscore the hurdles House Republicans face in cementing their transition from a nay-saying minority to a governing majority. \u201cCampaigning is for dividing. Governing is for uniting,\u201d GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas told CNN, adding that sentiment must extend beyond House Republicans to Biden and Senate Democrats. \u201cI\u2019d say in general, not everybody comes up here to be serious legislators. A lot of people come up here for fame and fortune. I spent 20 years in the military. I\u2019m focused on being a serious legislator,\u201d he added. Fitzpatrick told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely an adjustment,\u201d when describing the House Republicans\u2019 transition from minority to majority, particularly for those members who have not served in the majority before. But Fitzpatrick pointed to the fact that the messaging bills that Republicans have brought to the floor so far have passed almost unanimously. Some of the House GOP\u2019s biggest hurdles will come in trying to write a budget blueprint, which they hope will kick off negotiations over the raising debt ceiling, where Republicans are demanding steep spending cuts. Further complicating the GOP\u2019s goal to balance the budget and claw back federal spending, Republican leaders \u2013 egged on by Trump \u2013 have vowed not to touch Social Security and Medicare. Norman acknowledged how difficult it is going to be to coalesce around a framework that the entire conference can agree on. Before leaving Washington, the far-right House Freedom Caucus laid out their own hardline spending demands in the debt ceiling fight. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to get 218 on the first blush. What we present, there\u2019s gonna be some gnashing of teeth,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cEvery dollar up here has an advocate.\u201d Burchett told CNN he stands behind the proposals being pushed by the Freedom Caucus. \u201cIt seems like every time the conservatives are the only ones that compromise. And we are just going to have to say no compromise,\u201d he told CNN, adding he is willing to shut down the government on this issue. \u201cI did it under Trump, and I\u2019ll sure as heck do it under Biden.\u201d McCarthy said he thought it was \u201cproductive\u201d for his members to outline \u201cideas\u201d for the budget, and dismissed the idea that anyone was drawing red lines. Asked about Biden\u2019s insistence that House Republicans show them their budget before negotiations can continue, McCarthy replied, \u201cWhy do we have to have a budget out to talk about the debt ceiling? We\u2019re not passing the budget, we\u2019re doing a debt ceiling.\u201d He added that he has told the president, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to raise taxes, and we\u2019re not going to pass a clean debt ceiling, but everything else is up for negotiation.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Several key Republican senators on Tuesday pushed back against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 recent comments that US support for Ukraine is not a \u201cvital\u201d national interest, exposing a key intraparty fault line ahead of the 2024 election. CNN poll reveals who could be Trump's biggest competition for 2024 \u201cTo say this doesn\u2019t matter is to say that war crimes don\u2019t matter,\u201d South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression will \u201cgo beyond Ukraine\u201d and that \u201cif you don\u2019t get that, you\u2019re not listening to what he\u2019s saying.\u201d On Monday, DeSantis, who has not yet announced a presidential bid, said in a statement responding to a questionnaire from Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson that \u201cwhile the US has many vital national interests \u2026 becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them.\u201d \u201cWe cannot prioritize intervention in an escalating foreign war over the defense of our own homeland, especially as tens of thousands of Americans are dying every year from narcotics smuggled across our open border and our weapons arsenals critical for our own security are rapidly being depleted,\u201d DeSantis wrote in response to Carlson\u2019s request for 2024 GOP presidential candidates to provide their views on the war in Ukraine. Analysis: Republicans are having a 'malaise' moment The comments put DeSantis ideologically closer in line with former President Donald Trump, the biggest name in the 2024 primary, and at odds with the more traditional GOP party positioning of former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who has already entered the race, and former Vice President Mike Pence, who is widely expected to. Trump and DeSantis led the potential GOP field in a new CNN poll of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents released Tuesday. Sen. John Cornyn told CNN that he was \u201ckind of surprised\u201d to learn DeSantis\u2019 position, noting that it \u201craises questions.\u201d \u201cI mean, Gov. DeSantis is a veteran. He\u2019s a smart guy. I think he\u2019s a been a very good governor and I don\u2019t understand him saying that Ukraine isn\u2019t important to the United States,\u201d the Texas Republican said. Senate Republican Whip John Thune said he disagrees with DeSantis, \u201cbut that there is a diversity of opinion among members of our party. He\u2019s not alone on that.\u201d McCarthy said he won't support 'blank check' for Ukraine. Hear Zelensky's response \u201cThere are probably going to be other candidates in \u201924 on our side who may share that view, and certainly it\u2019s held by Republicans around the country,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said. \u201cI would argue, and I think the majority of people in this country recognize, how important it is that Ukraine repel Russia and stop this aggression and they be a sovereign country.\u201d Speaking on the Hugh Hewitt radio program, Sen. Marco Rubio dismissed DeSantis\u2019 characterization of the war as a \u201cterritorial dispute.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a territorial dispute in the sense that any more than it would be a territorial dispute if the United States decided that it wanted to invade Canada or take over the Bahamas,\u201d said Rubio, who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cJust because someone claims something doesn\u2019t mean it belongs to them.\u201d The Florida Republican added, \u201cThere is a national security interest in Ukraine. It\u2019s not the number one national security interest the United States has, but it\u2019s an important one.\u201d Asked about DeSantis saying that funding Ukraine is not in the US\u2019 interest, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee also pushed back. Fmr. Bush adviser: US should abandon 'weak' Ukraine \u201cI personally think that the United States should support Ukraine funding. There\u2019s always debates about how that should be done, and what level it should be done at, but no, I believe the United States should support the effort in Ukraine,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho. He added: \u201cI think that if we don\u2019t hold the line in Ukraine now, we\u2019re simply going to see the issue expand into other European nations.\u201d Haley \u2013 who like Trump announced an early bid for the GOP nomination \u2013 on Tuesday made her most pointed comments on DeSantis yet, claiming he was \u201ccopying\u201d Trump\u2019s position on Ukraine. \u201cPresident Trump is right when he says Governor DeSantis is copying him\u2014first in his style, then on entitlement reform, and now on Ukraine,\u201d Haley said in a statement. Trump told reporters traveling with him Monday night that he believed DeSantis was \u201cfollowing what I am saying\u201d on Ukraine, according to CBS News. \u201cIt is a flip-flop. He was totally different. Whatever I want, he wants,\u201d the former president added. A February review from CNN\u2019s KFile found DeSantis once strongly supported arming Ukraine as a conservative congressman in 2014 and 2015 to deter Russia\u2019s aggression in Eastern Europe. In an interview from December 2017, DeSantis continued to align himself with the \u201cReagan school that\u2019s tough on Russia,\u201d criticizing Democrats for not supporting sending aid to Ukraine.

            "article_content": "The Biden administration\u2019s scramble to prevent financial contagion from the crash of Silicon Valley Bank is both an attempt to shield a resilient but still-vulnerable economy and to prevent grave political fallout. The Treasury Department and federal regulators insisted there was no systemic risk to the banking system as a whole that could cause a repeat of the cataclysmic 2008 meltdown as they raced against the opening of Asian markets with measures to head off a run on small or regional US banks. They unrolled emergency measures Sunday evening that will guarantee deposits of SVB\u2019s customers. Regulators also closed down Signature Bank, another institution that was threatening to collapse, and ensured its customers would get a similar deal. US taxpayers will not finance either move, officials said. US regulators say SVB customers will be made whole as second bank fails The swift action may temper immediate stress in the financial markets. But it is too early to say whether the government will be forced into more sweeping action amid rising concerns about the health of the finance sector. The suddenness of the crisis is exacerbating anxiety since SVB failed, apparently out of nowhere, in 48 hours. Assurances by the White House and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the broader banking system is sound set up a new test of economic credibility for an administration scarred by its handling of high inflation. President Joe Biden sought to instill confidence in the US banking system when he addressed Americans Monday morning about his administration\u2019s emergency plan to contain the failure of the two banks. \u201cAmericans can rest assured that our banking system is safe. Your deposits are safe,\u201d Biden said in remarks from the Roosevelt Room. \u201cLet me also assure you we will not stop at this. We will do whatever is needed on top of all this.\u201d The SVB drama invoked the ghosts of 2008 and voter anger over bailouts granted to rich bankers who caused the crisis through greed and high-risk investments but bore little of the pain of the subsequent worst financial disaster since the 1930s, which was shouldered by the public. Underscoring the extreme sensitivity of this history, an administration official told reporters late Sunday that extraordinary moves to guarantee SVB customer deposits by a federal insurance mechanism did not amount to a bailout. \u201cThis is not funds from the taxpayer,\u201d the official said, adding that the bank\u2019s equity would not be propped up and that bondholders will be \u201cwiped out.\u201d But a political blame game was already erupting \u2013 a sign of how a dysfunctional and polarized Washington and a political system already stressed by the heated early exchanges of a new presidential election might struggle to deal with a truly threatening financial crisis. Biden vows to hold those responsible for Silicon Valley Bank failure 'fully accountable' Some Republicans accused Biden of unleashing a multi-trillion dollar spending spree that caused high inflation and forced the Federal Reserve into a high-interest rate strategy that made some banks more vulnerable. Others slammed federal authorities over the failure to prevent the collapse of SVB in the first place, reigniting a long-term feud over the government\u2019s role in the economy. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, showing his determination to leverage every issue to reinforce a culture-driven narrative for his potential presidential bid, accused SVB executives of being more interested in diversity and inclusion training than high finance. A deepening crisis that raised the need for congressional action would also prompt an immediate issue for new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has a tiny GOP majority and would face a huge task in lining up votes from his most radical members for any government response. But Republicans also got some blame. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and two-time Democratic presidential candidate, argued the fate of the stricken bank was the \u201cdirect result\u201d of ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d loosening of financial regulations. Any new economic shocks would be a political disaster for an administration already defined by multiple crises, especially as the president gets ready to launch his expected reelection campaign. It is crucial for Biden that he bring the situation under control quickly. He would face a disastrous political dilemma if worsening conditions forced a president \u2013 who has rooted his administration in lifting up working and middle class Americans \u2013 into a choice between bailing out rich bankers or letting contagion spill over. Populist Republicans, like his potential 2024 election rival Trump, would also pounce on any scenario in which Biden is seen as helping wealthy tech investors from liberal California. SVB employees received bonuses hours before bank shutdown, reports say A financial crisis would be an opening for Republicans who have seized on recent events, including a fast-rising threat from China, a perceived southern border crisis and stubbornly high inflation to try to convince voters an aging president is reeling. The widening political splits over the SVB failure are also offering an ill omen for a coming showdown over the need to raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit later this year. Republicans are demanding billions of dollars in spending cuts that would gut the Biden agenda to do so. But the president warns their intransigence could shatter US creditworthiness and pitch the US and global economies into a self-inflicted crisis. In retrospect, the timing of the SVB crisis was auspicious since it gave Yellen a weekend to line up a stabilization plan with global markets closed. Officials worked feverishly behind the scenes and briefed leaders and rank-and-file members of Congress. The sweeping moves Sunday evening from Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg were designed to prevent panicked investors from withdrawing funds from other banks, thereby threatening their survival, and also to allow firms with large deposits to make payroll and ensure their viability. All weekend, Yellen sought to be a voice of calm, simultaneously seeking to prevent the situation from racing out of control \u2013 in both its economic and political dimensions. \u201cLet me be clear that during the financial crisis, there were investors and owners of systemic large banks that were bailed out, and we\u2019re certainly not looking (to do that),\u201d Yellen told CBS News on Sunday. \u201cAnd the reforms that have been put in place means that we\u2019re not going to do that again.\u201d Shalanda Young, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, also sought to ease public concerns, insisting that the US banking system at large was \u201cmore resilient\u201d now. \u201cIt has a better foundation than before the [2008] financial crisis. That\u2019s largely due to the reforms put in place,\u201d Young said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d But the risks from the SVB drama are still acute for Biden. There is increasing debate, for instance, over whether the Federal Reserve should ease its harsh interest rate strategy \u2013 with markets expecting another 50 basis points hike soon \u2013 to avoid further exposing vulnerable banks. Sheila Bair, a top banking regulator during the 2008 crisis, told CNN the Fed should \u201chit pause.\u201d And California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff echoed those concerns, saying on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom\u201d on Sunday that Congress needed to find out whether the central bank considered \u201cthe possibility that some institutions may not be able to handle such a rapid increase in rates.\u201d The debate underscores Biden\u2019s jam on the economy. If the Fed paused its rates strategy, inflation that is hammering voters and is politically corrosive for the president could get worse after some recent signs it is abating. But if the Fed presses on, the risks that its actions damage the wider economy and spike unemployment could grow. In his initial comments on the crisis, McCarthy was temperate, apparently seeking to contain the risk of a run on the banks in his home state of California, while talking up the quality of SVB\u2019s customer assets, given that one option was a takeover from another, bigger bank. \u201cThe administration has tools to deal with this,\u201d McCarthy said on Fox. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t live off somebody putting something on Twitter. Let the actions of the administration take work here before anybody goes to any positions in their own bank.\u201d But McCarthy also twisted the knife in Biden, days after he rejected the president\u2019s new budget as a multi-trillion dollar spending spree. And the speaker tried to exploit the SVB crisis to improve his position on the debt-ceiling showdown. \u201cHigh debt brings inflation,\u201d he warned. \u201cAnd what happens with inflation? You see with this bank, interest rates moving up, where they\u2019re stuck in bonds and others. We watched the pain that it causes American citizens.\u201d South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace underscored the difficultly McCarthy would face in mobilizing any congressional action if the crisis spreads and the administration asks for help. \u201cI would not support a bailout,\u201d Mace told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday morning. She added: \u201cWe cannot keep bailing out private companies, because there\u2019s no consequences to their actions.\u201d The fierce bipartisan resistance to bailing out bankers is shared on both sides of the aisle, underscoring how the long-term consequences of unpopular efforts to stave off the 2008 crisis are still weighing heavily on national politics, potentially constraining the government\u2019s power to respond to any new large-scale catastrophe in the banking system. Before the administration\u2019s Sunday evening announcement, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents the California district where SVB was headquartered, led calls for the administration to do more to make customers of the institution whole, while dismissing bank executives. \u201cThe bargain in our country from FDR has always been, investors and shareholders lose. I have no sympathy for the executives, no sympathy for people who have stock there. But the depositors are protected,\u201d Khanna said on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Republican presidential candidates also sought an opening. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley warned: \u201cIt is not the responsibility of the American taxpayer to step in. The era of big government and corporate bailouts must end.\u201d Meanwhile DeSantis\u2019 attempt to blame the bank\u2019s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs was a reminder, that, unlike Biden, a potential candidate has no responsibility for the wider economy.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas was censured Saturday by the state GOP for \u201cfor lack of fidelity to Republican principles and priorities,\u201d the party announced. The Texas Republican Party took issue with several House votes and stances by the second-term congressman, including his vote for the Respect for Marriage Act, his opposition to a GOP-led border security measure and the fact that he was the lone House Republican to vote against his conference\u2019s rules package earlier this year. Gonzales represents Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District, which stretches along the US-Mexico border between El Paso and San Antonio. The district is home to Uvalde, where a mass shooting at an elementary school last year killed 19 children and two teachers. After the shooting, Gonzales voted in favor of bipartisan gun-safety legislation \u2013 another vote cited in the censure resolution. Under the penalties imposed on Gonzales as a result of the censure, the state GOP is not permitted to spend on his behalf during a primary campaign and could fund a primary opponent. The party is also discouraging him from running as a Republican. The penalties would expire after a primary runoff, according to the state GOP. In response to the censure, a Gonzales campaign spokesperson told CNN: \u201cToday, like every day, Congressman Tony Gonzales went to work on behalf of the people of TX-23. He talked to veterans, visited with Border Patrol agents, and met constituents in a county he flipped from blue to red. The Republican Party of Texas would be wise to follow his lead and do some actual work.\u201d The House GOP campaign arm stressed its support for Gonzales following Saturday\u2019s developments in Texas. \u201cCongressman Gonzales is a valued member of the House majority, and we look forward to supporting his re-election,\u201d Delanie Bomar, regional press secretary at the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in an email. Gonzales served as a co-chair of the committee\u2019s Young Guns program for top recruits in the last election cycle. At Saturday\u2019s censure vote, 57 members of the State Republican Executive Committee backed the motion, five voted against it and one abstained. The censure resolution was originally bought by the Republican Party in Medina County, which is in Gonzales\u2019 district. Fifteen other local party organizations in his district passed concurring resolutions. Gonzales was first elected in 2020 to succeed retiring Republican Will Hurd. He easily won election to a second term in his Hispanic-majority district last fall. The only other time the Texas GOP has voted to censure a Republican official was in 2018, when Texas House Speaker Joe Straus was censured, according to the state party. This story has been updated with additional information and reaction.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia falsely claimed Tuesday that the Biden administration is responsible for the fentanyl deaths of two young men who actually died during the Trump administration \u2013 and her congressional spokesperson profanely dismissed questions about the false claim as irrelevant. Michigan mother and conservative activist Rebecca Kiessling testified to the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday about how her sons Caleb, 20, and Kyler, 18, had died on July 29, 2020, as a result of fentanyl poisoning from taking pills Kiessling said they had mistakenly believed were safer pain pills. Kiessling made an emotional plea for stronger federal action to prevent the importation of fentanyl over the southern border, claiming, \u201cYou\u2019re welcoming drug dealers across our border!\u201d (Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is largely smuggled in by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking past unprotected stretches of the border.) Then, later in the day, Greene tweeted a video of an exchange she had with Kiessling at the hearing. But Greene wrongly suggested in the tweet that Kiessling had blamed the Biden administration for the death of her sons. In fact, Kiessling had explicitly told the committee the date of the tragedy, making clear that it happened with more than five months left in the presidency of Donald Trump. \u201cListen to this mother, who lost two children to fentanyl poisoning, tell the truth about both of her son\u2019s murders because of the Biden administrations refusal to secure our border and stop the Cartel\u2019s from murdering Americans everyday by Chinese fentanyl,\u201d Greene tweeted. Greene, who supported the Trump presidency and has endorsed his 2024 run, has more than 2 million followers on Twitter. CNN reached out to the spokesperson for her congressional office, Nick Dyer, on Tuesday night to ask for comment on the false claim and to ask whether Greene had any plans to delete or correct the tweet. Dyer responded in an email by asking whether CNN thinks the many Americans who have died from drugs under Biden \u201ccare about the details\u201d of this particular case. He added, \u201cDo you think they give a f**k  about your bullsh*t fact checking?\u201d Unrelated to CNN\u2019s inquiry, a fact check notice was affixed to the bottom of Greene\u2019s tweet later Tuesday night through Twitter\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d crowdsourcing feature. The tweet had been viewed more than 3 million times before noon on Wednesday. Asked about the tweet, Kiessling, an anti-abortion advocate who has been active in the Republican Party grassroots, noted in an email on Wednesday morning that the number of fentanyl deaths increased sharply between 2020 and 2021. She argued that \u201cif the border had been secured during the Obama administration when the federal government first knew of this issue, my sons would be alive today.\u201d Kiessling concluded: \u201cThe whole of our federal government has failed, Congress included.\u201d US deaths from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids first spiked under Obama in the mid-2010s, then continued to rise under Trump and accelerated again during the Covid-19 pandemic, including early in Biden\u2019s presidency. There have recently been preliminary signs of improvement in US overdose-death numbers, though they remain much higher than they were in 2020 and earlier. Greene\u2019s false tweet about the Biden administration was not her only dishonest claim that day. At a Tuesday meeting of congressional Republicans\u2019 caucus on \u201celection integrity,\u201d Greene castigated a Georgia Republican election official, Gabriel Sterling, who has repeatedly vouched for the integrity of the 2020 election in the state. Greene\u2019s comments, which she also posted on Twitter, featured a variety of lies that were long ago debunked by Sterling and many others. Greene falsely claimed that \u201cTrump won Georgia,\u201d though he lost by 11,779 votes, fair and square, in a state with a Republican governor, Republican elections chief and Republican-controlled legislature. She falsely claimed that there were \u201cthousands of dead voters in Georgia,\u201d though Georgia elections officials have found only four such cases in the 2020 election to date and Trump allies\u2019 claims about various other supposedly deceased voters have been disproven by CNN and others. And she falsely claimed that a video showed workers in Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County doing something nefarious while counting ballots, though the workers were simply doing their jobs and though false claims about the video have been debunked not only by Sterling but by Trump\u2019s deputy attorney general and a Trump-appointed former US attorney in Georgia, among others. Greene has been persistently inaccurate about the 2020 election. Dyer, Greene\u2019s spokesperson, responded with a profane dismissal when asked for comment Tuesday night about Greene\u2019s latest false election claims.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 new book, \u201cThe Courage to Be Free,\u201d leans into the culture wars that established him as one of the early Republican favorites for the GOP nomination for the presidency. While more sparse on biographical details than most political memoirs, the 256-page book offers some new insights into his upbringing, college years and military service. But mostly, DeSantis rehashes his contentious four years as governor and suggests he has laid a path for others to follow. \u201cThe battles we have fought in Florida \u2013 from defeating the biomedical security state to stifling woke corporations to fighting indoctrination in schools \u2013 strike at the heart of what it means to be a Floridian and an American,\u201d DeSantis writes. The book\u2019s release has coincided with the soft-launch of the Republican\u2019s presidential campaign and it ends with a forward-looking note that alludes at the next challenge ahead. \u201cThe Florida Blueprint is a simple formula: be willing to lead, have the courage of your convictions, deliver for your constituents, and reap the political rewards. This is a blueprint for America\u2019s revival. We\u2019ve shown it can be done,\u201d he writes. CNN obtained an advance copy of the book before its publication on Tuesday. Here are four takeaways: DeSantis largely avoids direct confrontation with former President Donald Trump, whom he praises for his \u201cunique star power,\u201d \u201cmassive following\u201d and  \u201cfilling the void that GOP leaders had left by ignoring the preferences of their own voters.\u201d He continued his defense of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign against investigations for Russian election interference. But DeSantis expended considerable ink challenging Trump\u2019s version of the 2018 Florida governor race to claim back credit for his victory. Trump has claimed DeSantis \u201cbegged\u201d for a gubernatorial endorsement in the Republican gubernatorial primary \u2013 shed tears even. Before Trump got involved, DeSantis was \u201cdead\u201d and \u201cleaving the race,\u201d the former president recently told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt. DeSantis recalled asking Trump in late 2017 \u201cif he would be willing to send out a tweet touting me as a good candidate for Florida governor.\u201d Trump, DeSantis said, \u201cseemed amenable, but at the same time, I was not holding my breath.\u201d Trump did tweet about DeSantis, calling him \u201ca brilliant young leader\u201d and playing up the then-congressman\u2019s Ivy League credentials. In DeSantis\u2019 telling, he recognized the power of Trump\u2019s endorsement, but suggested its appeal was limited. \u201cI do not think Republican primary voters are sheep who simply follow an endorsement from a politician they like without any individual analysis, but I do believe that a major endorsement can put a candidate on the radar of GOP voters in a way that boosts a good candidate\u2019s prospects,\u201d he writes. DeSantis later says it was his debate performance, not Trump\u2019s support, that led to a reversal in the polling. He omitted, though, that Trump had tweeted a more forceful \u201cfull endorsement\u201d of DeSantis just two months before the primary. Nor did he note that Trump sent a team of Florida operatives to help DeSantis\u2019 campaign after the primary. Throughout the book, DeSantis finds more opportunities to undercut the former president. At several points, DeSantis bemoans the lack of activity in Trump\u2019s first two years in office, when Republicans controlled the House and Senate. Though he doesn\u2019t blame Trump explicitly, when juxtaposed against his own record compelling Republican lawmakers in his state to act repeatedly in service of his agenda, the implication seems clear. \u201cHere we had a unified Republican government for the first time in more than a decade, and yet so much of the time was frittered away on matters like the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign had colluded with Russia, which GOP-led committees investigated for two years,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhy Congress didn\u2019t do more significant things, such as appropriating money to build the wall at the US-Mexico border, was beyond me.\u201d DeSantis\u2019 book frames his battle with Disney as a demarcation line in his political story. It\u2019s mentioned on the second page of the introduction. The juiciest excerpts from that particular chapter (which he labeled \u201cThe Magic Kingdom of Woke Corporatism\u201d) were released in advance to Fox News. And, in a symbolic move, he signed the bill to remove Disney\u2019s special governing powers Monday, the eve of his book\u2019s release. DeSantis\u2019 views his own political feud with the company as somewhat ironic, given that he married his wife in Disney World. He also is quite clear that his wife, Casey, who hailed from \u201ca family of Disney enthusiasts,\u201d was the catalyst for the location of their nuptials. \u201cMy only condition was that no Disney characters could be part of our wedding,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI wanted our special day to look and feel like a traditional wedding. I didn\u2019t want Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck in our wedding photos.\u201d His relationship with Florida\u2019s largest employer broke down last year as outrage intensified over a Florida bill to limit the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity. DeSantis recalled then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek told him during a phone call that he did not want to get the company involved but was under pressure to weigh in. DeSantis urged Chapek to steer clear and suggested the blowback would pass in 48 hours once there is \u201csome new outrage that the woke mob will focus on.\u201d \u201cYou will end up putting yourself in an untenable position,\u201d he recalled telling Chapek. \u201cPeople like me will say, Gee, how come Disney has never said anything about China, where they make a fortune?\u2019\u201d Disney ultimately weighed in, saying in a statement that it was \u201cdedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.\u201d And DeSantis pounced, as he said he would. To DeSantis, the episode is a microcosm of a greater struggle between the fight conservatives expect from GOP leaders and the instincts of Republicans not to meddle in the affairs of businesses. DeSantis argues, \u201cIn this environment, old-guard corporate Republicanism is not up to the task at hand.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, the sad upshot of these changes is that corporate America has become a major protagonist in battles over American politics and culture. The battle lines almost invariably find large, publicly traded corporations lining up behind leftist causes,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is unthinkable that these large companies would side with conservative Americans on issues such as the Second Amendment, the right to life, election integrity, and religious liberty.\u201d DeSantis\u2019 first book, the little-read \u201cDreams from Our Founding Fathers\u201d published in 2011, is a case for limited government, separation of powers, humble leadership and executive constraint. DeSantis\u2019 latest book is a defense of his most contentious executive actions, achieved by consolidating power and flexing executive authority, in ways that suggest he has undergone an evolution of his previous principles. In \u201cThe Courage to be Free,\u201d DeSantis \u2013 the former star athlete and Naval officer \u2013 demonstrates a tactical precision for using his executive powers in ways intended to keep Democrats and the media off guard in pursuit of an aggressive and partisan agenda. He brought to the job, he writes, \u201can understanding of how a constitutional form of government operates, the various pressure points that exist, and the best way to leverage authority to achieve substantial policy victories.\u201d \u201cOne of my first orders of business after getting elected was to have my transition team amass an exhaustive list of all the constitutional, statutory, and customary powers of the governor. I wanted to be sure that I was using every lever available to advance our priorities,\u201d he writes. DeSantis, looking to jumpstart his political career in 2011, eviscerated then-President Barack Obama for what he described as executive overreach. He accused Obama\u2019s then-health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, of using \u201cher power to intimidate private businesses for engaging in speech she didn\u2019t like.\u201d He wrote Obama was \u201cresorting to using crude vulgarisms, such as the term \u2018teabagger,\u2019 to describe their fellow citizens simply because these citizens dissented from progressive orthodoxy.\u201d But in \u201cThe Courage to Be Free,\u201d labeling corporations as \u201cwoke\u201d and punishing those that speak out \u201cis not only prudent but necessary to counteract efforts by large corporations to impose a woke agenda on the rest of us.\u201d As DeSantis writes: \u201cIt is regrettable that our nation has become so politicized, but the fact is that private companies wielding de facto public power is not in the best interests of most Americans.\u201d DeSantis built his reelection for governor around his response to Covid-19 and his book makes clear he will continue to make that a part of his message as he looks toward a potential campaign for president. As he often does, DeSantis described Florida as a \u201ccitadel of freedom in the United States,\u201d and defended his actions to reopen schools for the 2020-2021 school year. \u201cWhen I announced Florida\u2019s back to school policy, perhaps because I did so during the height of the summer COVID-19 wave, there was substantial public opposition to my decision,\u201d DeSantis says. \u201cFor all the controversy that swirled around my decision, and all the incoming fire I took by making it, there was never a doubt in my mind that keeping our schools open was right for our state.\u201d \u201cKeeping Florida free\u201d from Covid-19 restrictions has earned DeSantis criticism from Democrats and health experts \u2013 a badge he proudly wears. But DeSantis also puts up his response against the rest of the country, even Trump, who he noted stood behind health officials who pushed states to shut down activity for two weeks to slow the spread. DeSantis also shared insight into his efforts to open up Florida for sports, including a promise to UFC president Dana White to big foot any local government that prevented him from holding fights in Florida. \u201cI will overrule any mayor that gives you guys a hard time,\u201d DeSantis told White. DeSantis called for a \u201cthorough and unbiased investigation of all aspects of the pandemic,\u201d including the origins of the virus. On Monday, John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, said, \u201cThere is not a consensus right now, in the US government about exactly how Covid got started. There is just not an intelligence community consensus.\u201d Kirby added that Biden made trying to find the origins of Covid a \u201cpriority.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is keeping his word to radicals who put him in power and rewarding those who can keep him there, paving a smooth start to his tenure that may, however, be storing up trouble down the road. The California Republican handed hard-right House members with plum committee assignments, dumped several high-profile Democrats from key panels to please the conservative media universe, launched investigations into the \u201cweaponization\u201d of government against Republicans like former President Donald Trump and gave a pass to Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene when she heckled President Joe Biden during the State of the Union address or suggested \u201cnational divorce\u201d between red and blue states. He\u2019s refused to demand the resignation of New York Rep. George Santos, a serial fabulist, who might be an embarrassment but whose seat remains critical to the GOP\u2019s tiny majority. McCarthy defends release of January 6 footage to Tucker Carlson: 'I promised' This week, in his most stunning move yet, McCarthy is giving Fox News host Tucker Carlson exclusive access to security footage of the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection. The move may fuel Carlson\u2019s false claims and conspiracies about a heinous attack on American democracy. The Fox primetime star has in the past baselessly claimed people working for the FBI orchestrated the invasion of Congress. McCarthy is currying favor with a past critic and supremely powerful media host he\u2019d love to get on his side as he tries to rule his conference and court the conservative base. He\u2019s already used the effort in fundraising appeals. And his move may also help whitewash Trump\u2019s culpability for the insurrection, weeks after the ex-president played a role in helping him win the speakership. After appeasing demands from GOP holdouts and finally securing the speakership on the 15th roll call vote last month, McCarthy\u2019s opponents argue that he\u2019s now cravenly paying back the most extreme members of the most radical GOP conference in modern American history. But perhaps, he\u2019s also purchasing goodwill among his members that could give him more maneuvering room when he needs votes later in the year over critically important issues like raising the government\u2019s borrowing limit, agreeing on a budget and sending more military aid to Ukraine. Yet there\u2019s little in McCarthy\u2019s past as a Republican leader that suggests he has such political dexterity. And the most riotous members of the House GOP seem highly unlikely to accept McCarthy\u2019s concessions and fall in line. Nor does the uncompromising ideology of some of the political and media influencers he\u2019s courting suggest they\u2019d be content to cede power to him. Fox News executives refused to let Trump on-air when he called in during January 6 attack, Dominion says And as McCarthy parries accusations that he\u2019s acting from naked political motivations, he\u2019s adopting superficially principled justifications that mock his critics. He told The New York Times he handed over the security tapes because he had \u201cpromised\u201d to do so. The speaker gave such an undertaking to Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP source told CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona, in his quest to secure the gavel, but the apparent deal did not specify that Carlson should get the footage. McCarthy suggested to the Times he was also acting in the interests of transparency. \u201cI was asked in the press about these tapes, and I said they do belong to the American public. I think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment.\u201d Except, he\u2019s not giving them to the American people so anyone can see them, or releasing them to all media, at least yet. The speaker is specifically offering access to a conservative TV host who has made no secret of his agenda. Had he wanted to create that ray of sunshine, McCarthy could have posted them online, tasked congressional committees to examine them or invited other media outlets to also view them. The credibility of Fox News \u2013 Carlson\u2019s television home and the apparent destiny of the tapes \u2013 has, meanwhile, taken a hit following revelations from text messages and emails in a court filing this week that some of Fox\u2019s biggest stars and executives privately dismissed Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud after the 2020 election but allowed them to dominate its airwaves. Just as McCarthy is apparently unwilling to challenge the power of conservative media, Fox appeared unwilling to alienate a conservative audience that wanted to believe Trump won. CNN has reached out to Fox News and Carlson with questions about how the security footage will be handled but had not received a response as of Thursday evening. McCarthy also tried to cast his stance on Santos, who lied about large portions of his biography and career resume, as a democratic one. House GOP looks for plan B after struggling to pass border security bill \u201cThe voters of his district have elected him,\u201d McCarthy said of the freshman in January, suggesting that to demand the resignation of the New York Republican would be an affront to democracy \u2013 even though it appears voters had no idea of the truth about Santos when they sent him to Washington. McCarthy has since hinted that his position could change if the House Ethics Committee \u201cfinds something\u201d against Santos, who won a district that Biden carried in 2020 and that could be tough for the GOP to hold. McCarthy\u2019s stances have led to criticism and enraged Democrats, who say his release of the footage to Carlson could endanger the security of the Capitol. But in America\u2019s bitter political climate, appealing to activist political bases is often the first consideration \u2013 especially in the radicalized Republican Party of the Trump era. In the modern GOP, earning the anger of the media is an essential element of appealing to grassroots voters and often seems a major motivation of top party figures. Previous Republican speakers like John Boehner and Paul Ryan tried to manage their radical right-wing conferences while staying faithful to the institutional responsibilities of their leadership position. It was a balancing act that eventually doomed their tenures. McCarthy appears to be taking the opposite tack, throwing his lot in completely with the extremists who have outsized influence due to the far-smaller-than-expected House majority the GOP managed to win in the 2022 midterms. But his accommodation of his conference might only work in the short term. Republican leaders wrestle with GOP splinter on Ukraine aid on Capitol Hill In a sign of growing trouble, a border security bill that McCarthy had hoped to pass early in the new Congress is still in limbo after moderates voiced fierce opposition to a three-page draft drawn up by conservative Rep. Chip Roy from Texas. The dispute underscores the fatal flaw in the GOP majority between right-wingers keen to appeal to the base and moderates who won seats in states like New York and California, where they could face difficult reelection bids in 2024. CNN also reported this week on bitter splits between factions of the GOP on the question of more aid for Ukraine. McCarthy has tried to finesse this divide by saying he favors support for the Kyiv government but is also against a \u201cblank check\u201d for President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 in a nod to lawmakers like Gaetz and Greene who oppose multi-billion dollar US aid packages. The speaker\u2019s position is allowing him to avoid alienating either faction so far, but it will come under fierce pressure when massive requests for arms and ammunition for Ukraine arrive on Capitol Hill. McCarthy also appears to be navigating into a perilous position on a looming showdown with Biden over the need to raise the government\u2019s borrowing authority, or the debt ceiling, later this year. If the authority is not granted by Congress, the US could default on its obligations, shredding its credit rating and throwing the American and global economies into turmoil. But McCarthy is standing with the most radical members of his conference who are demanding huge spending cuts, which Biden has refused to accept, in order to lift the debt ceiling. The California Republican may end up with a fateful choice between backing the lawmakers who elected him speaker and crashing the economy, since, if he tried to grant Biden such authority by using some Democratic votes, it\u2019s possible he\u2019d be toppled.",

            "article_content": "As the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine approaches, the Republican Party finds itself bitterly divided on Capitol Hill over whether the US should continue aiding Ukraine \u2013 a dispute that is only expected to intensify in the months ahead even as GOP leaders have sought to downplay it. On Tuesday, a group of House Republicans led a congressional delegation to Ukraine to reaffirm the United States\u2019 commitment to the war-torn nation, after promoting a similar message at the global Munich Security Conference over the weekend. But back home, the GOP\u2019s isolationist wing spent the week publicly bashing President Joe Biden\u2019s surprise visit to Ukraine and re-upped their calls to end military and financial aid to the country. It\u2019s a dynamic that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has had to navigate carefully. The California Republican recently told CNN he does not support a resolution from GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida declaring congressional \u201cfatigue\u201d over supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, which shows no signs of abating. But McCarthy reiterated he would not automatically rubber stamp whatever aid package the Biden administration requests \u2013 a clear sign that it\u2019s going to be far more difficult to pass any further Ukraine funding under a GOP-led House. GOP 2024 hopefuls divided over US role in Ukraine war \u201cNo, I support Ukraine,\u201d McCarthy said when asked by CNN whether he supports Gaetz\u2019s measure. \u201cI don\u2019t support a blank check, though. We spent $100 billion here, we want to win. I think the actions that President Biden has taken are a bit too late.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 who attended the Munich Security Conference over the weekend \u2013 has given an even sharper message, making it his personal mission of sorts to try and quell the more isolationist voices in his party and assure the Ukrainians that the US will not abandon them. \u201cReports about the death of Republican support for strong American leadership in the world have been greatly exaggerated. \u2026 Don\u2019t look at Twitter, look at people in power,\u201d McConnell said at the security conference on Friday. \u201cRepublican leaders are committed to a strong trans-Atlantic alliance. We are committed to helping Ukraine.\u201d The topic of Ukraine funding will be front and center when both spending fights and presidential politics heat up later this year. Republicans are seeking to rein in spending across the federal government now that they control the House and will have leverage in negotiations to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, while conservatives on the campaign trail are looking to contrast their priorities against Biden\u2019s in the prelude to the 2024 election cycle. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday on Fox News that US aid to Ukraine was little more than an \u201copen-ended blank check\u201d  \u2013 a sentiment shared by a handful of House Republicans who have growing power in a narrowly divided Congress. For now, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill still view it differently, setting up a clash that could come next fall when the fight over government spending kicks into full gear. Republicans leaders will have to contend with a small but vocal bloc of anti-interventionists within their party who view military support for Ukraine as a prime example of US government waste. In a House of Representatives where Republicans control a razor-thin majority and conservative hardliners have a stranglehold on McCarthy\u2019s speakership, those voices can\u2019t simply be ignored. When asked by CNN what spending cuts Republicans want to see, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2013 a conservative hardliner and McCarthy ally \u2013 immediately pointed to Ukraine funding. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019d like to see is we can stop spending over a billion dollars every single month to the government of Ukraine, and propping their government up,\u201d Greene said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent $113 billion in the war over there. And this hasn\u2019t doing anything for our border, and our people.\u201d Since the start of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Congress has appropriated roughly $113 billion in security assistance and humanitarian aid to the country. But congressional support for Ukraine has waned over time: only a handful of Republicans opposed the initial efforts to bolster Ukraine, but they were joined by over 50 other House Republicans voting against an aid package in May. It\u2019s expected Congress will be asked to give additional money in the next fiscal year, but the ability to do so will hinge largely on whether GOP leaders can hold together support among their members and whether GOP voters see the war effort in Ukraine as a worthy cause. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve had to do additional funding, it\u2019s gotten harder. I mean there is a constituency out there that doesn\u2019t see the value of it,\u201d Senate Republican whip John Thune warned. Right now, public support for aiding Ukraine is also waning and Republican voters are even more reluctant to send resources across the Atlantic than Democrats. It\u2019s a dynamic that GOP leaders are watching closely. In a revealing interview on Fox News last week, McConnell took the issue head on when asked what Biden could do to help the American people see the value in funding the war effort in Ukraine. \u201cI am going to try to help explain to the American people that defeating the Russians in Ukraine is the single most important event going on in the world right now,\u201d McConnell said, adding later, \u201cI am sorry public opinion is sliding, but I want to reassure the American people this is enormously important. We need to stay together on a bipartisan basis in our country and defend these people who are bravely fighting for freedom and democracy in Ukraine.\u201d Behind the scenes, GOP leaders are also taking that message directly to their members. In the Senate, the GOP hosted a lunch last week aimed at cementing support and educating the rank-and-file on where the security assistance to Ukraine was going and how the money was under strict oversight in an effort to assuage any concerns funds were wasted. An aide familiar with the meeting told CNN that Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services committee, presented. The next day, senators told CNN Wicker sent members \u201ca whole chart\u201d of how much money the US gave and how much European Union countries were giving. \u201cThe oversight that is going with the funds right now is really significant,\u201d Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, said after the meeting. \u201cI think based on the last report that I have seen, you can\u2019t count the number of oversight organizations on two hands and the fact that the government of Ukraine has made it overtly clear that they will punish those individuals that are caught in any sort of corruption activity.\u201d Many Senate Republicans are united in their efforts to fund Ukraine \u2013 and any legislation that would come up for a vote in the chamber on funding would likely pass with Democratic support. In the House, the challenge is more acute as it will be up to McCarthy to decide what bills come to the floor. And while he could rely on Democratic votes to carry any Ukraine funding over the finish line, such a move would alienate his right flank \u2013 and it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s a risk McCarthy is willing to take. Even in response to Biden\u2019s surprise visit to Ukraine, there was conservative uproar. Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania tweeted Monday that it was \u201cbreathtaking that President Biden can show up in Ukraine to ensure their border is secure, but can\u2019t do the same for America.\u201d Greene tweeted it was \u201cinsulting\u201d for Biden to visit Kyiv, saying the president \u201cchose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine\u2019s government and war.\u201d She said critically that Biden went to Ukraine rather than East Palestine, Ohio, the site of a train derailment that left the community reeling. And GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde said of Biden\u2019s foreign policy: \u201cAmerica Last is an understatement.\u201d Earlier this month, Gaetz introduced a resolution seeking to end US aid to Ukraine. The resolution has just 11 original co-signers, but it still shows the major challenge for Republican leaders over the issue as they seek to continue funding the US efforts to help the besieged country. \u201cI think we have had a lot of discussions about transparency. Maybe they aren\u2019t getting that same information,\u201d Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said about the House-Senate divide. \u201cI think maybe there are more people over there who view it as an enhancement of war where we see it as a protection of freedom.\u201d \u201cI think there is always fatigue, and I think that is what you are beginning to see is \u2018how long is this going to go on?\u2019 \u2018This is billions and billions of dollars, and we know there have been corruption problems in this country.\u2019 So I just think it starts to build on itself,\u201d Capito said. Top House Republicans have continued to try and rally support for Ukraine in their ranks, while former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently made the rounds on Capitol Hill to pitch conservatives on the need for continued support for the country. Still, the GOP\u2019s defense hawks know they have their work cut out for them. \u201cWe have seen time and again the majority of Republicans and Democrats support our assistance to Ukraine. But the Biden administration needs to lay out their long-term strategy,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, who led the delegation of House Republicans to Ukraine this week, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThere are some Members who would be more supportive if they saw a long-term strategy that was based on a Ukrainian victory rather than sending just enough support to prolong the war but not win it.\u201d For now, senators are confident that McCarthy will be willing to bring up a bill that includes more funding for Ukraine down the line. \u201cThis really is a fight between Democracy and authoritarianism and there may be some loud voices in the House in the Republican conference, but at least in terms of all the votes I have seen to date, they are a tiny minority. It\u2019s the mice that are trying to roar,\u201d Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said. \u201cI think we are going to be fine. I think Kevin gets it is in our national security interest that Putin be defeated in Ukraine. I mean the critics are isolationists about everything. They wanted to get out of Afghanistan. I mean isolationism has been with us forever in both parties,\u201d said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham.",

            "article_content": "There is no more powerful symbol of Vladimir Putin\u2019s failure. A year ago, the Russian leader launched a blitzkrieg against Ukraine, mocking its history and sovereignty, sending his tanks churning toward Kyiv to obliterate the democratically elected government led by a former comic actor. His purpose was clear: To crush once and for all Ukraine\u2019s dreams of joining the West and to force it to return to the orbit of greater Russia. Back then, anyone predicting how the anniversary of the war would be marked might have mused about a Russian military parade and a visit by Putin himself to a puppet leader he installed in a nation again under Moscow\u2019s iron fist. The reality is far different following heroic Ukrainian resistance bolstered by weapons sent by NATO members. The president of the United States, in overcoat and shades, strolled through Kyiv in daylight, visiting a historic church as air raid sirens wailed and standing exposed alongside President Volodymyr Zelensky in the city\u2019s vast, open and iconic St. Michael\u2019s Square. His presence sent a message of defiance to Putin most directly and a cherished sign of resolve and empathy for the people of Ukraine. His audience also included European powers in a western alliance that Biden has led and invigorated like no president since the end of the Cold War. And every time a commander-in-chief makes such an audacious splash on the world stage he\u2019s also making a point to Americans \u2013 on whose support continuing extraordinary support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort depends \u2013 and to his own fervent domestic critics. Biden deliberately contrasted the sense of then and now that his visit, just before the anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion, conjured. \u201cThat dark night one year ago, the world was literally at the time bracing for the fall of Kyiv,\u201d Biden told Zelensky at a news conference flanked by the Stars and Stripes and Ukraine\u2019s distinctive blue and yellow national flag. The event itself carried its own symbolism \u2013 it did not feature two leaders cowering in a bunker, but went ahead in an ornate room like any other leaders\u2019 press conference in any other capital. \u201cOne year later, Kyiv stands. And Ukraine stands. Democracy stands,\u201d he declared. \u201cThe Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.\u201d Biden\u2019s words might have lacked the poetry of \u201cIch bin ein Berliner,\u201d or \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d But Biden\u2019s visit instantly went down in history alongside two defining trips to divided Berlin by Presidents John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan that were flashpoints of the Cold War and each of which sent their own image of US resolve to the Kremlin. Those events made clear that the United States stood with its Western allies for as long as it took to prevail over the Soviet Union. Biden\u2019s visit was meant to give similar historic heft to his comment Washington is there for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d \u2014 though it\u2019s unlikely that it will assuage fears in Kyiv and Europe that a change in president might weaken that US vow. Biden\u2019s secret visit, which involved the president leaving the US unannounced and heading to an active war zone, matched some of the colorful stagecraft that Zelensky \u2013 a master of public relations \u2013 has used to maintain Western support for his people and the multi-billion-dollar pipeline of weapons and aid. During America\u2019s Middle East wars of the last 20 years, Americans became accustomed to Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump leaving Washington in the dead of night and popping up in Baghdad or Kabul to visit US troops and US-backed leaders. And while those trips had their own measure of daring and danger, Biden\u2019s visit went a step further \u2013 venturing into a foreign capital that is often under air attack and lacks the security offered by large garrisons of American troops and air assets. The US did inform Russia of the plans to visit for \u201cdeconfliction purposes,\u201d according to Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Biden had always planned to visit Europe this week to mark the anniversary of the Russian invasion \u2014 though his public program mentioned only a trip to neighboring Poland. But a journey across the Atlantic that lacked a Ukrainian component would have been unsatisfactory given that fact that many European leaders have already visited Kyiv. Still, the security footprint of the US president is far greater than the one accompanying those leaders, and his position as the leader of the West leaves him far more exposed. But by not visiting Ukraine, Biden would have been implicitly admitting that there were some things that Putin could prevent him from doing \u2013 in effect showing US weakness. Ukrainians understood the intent better than anyone. \u201cThe tipping point in this war will not be when we receive another set of weapons but when our alliance will stop playing reactive roles to what Putin will do,\u201d Kira Rudik, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, told \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d \u201cPresident Biden has claimed the upper hand \u2026 and tomorrow Putin will have to reply to what happened today,\u201d Rudik said, referring to a speech in which Putin is expected to rally the Russian people on Tuesday. Political symbolism is only effective if it gets results, drives policy and changes an entrenched situation. So, like the Berlin visits of Kennedy and Reagan, the true historic sweep of Biden\u2019s perilous journey to Ukraine can only be judged in the light of subsequent events. In other words, his gesture will be an empty one if Russia \u2013 which appears to be mustering for a spring offensive \u2013 wins the war. Watch President Biden's full speech from surprise visit to Kyiv And while the pictures of Biden in Kyiv were remarkable, they cannot disguise real questions and uncertainties surrounding the US approach to the war and differences with the Ukrainians. This plays out both in the types of weapons the US is prepared to offer and potentially in divergent scenarios about how the war could end. The phrase \u201cas long as it takes\u201d can mean different things to different people and there is every sign that this war, which Putin cannot afford to lose, could grind on for many bloody more years, testing Western resolve. The personal nature of the president\u2019s rebuke to Putin is meanwhile likely to trigger a response from a ruthless leader who has shown no mercy to civilians and a cruel indifference to the value of human life \u2013 Russian as well as Ukrainian. One potential way Biden\u2019s visit could backfire is that it could bolster Putin\u2019s claim that he is really fighting a war against the West rather than an independent sovereign nation \u2013 a framing that is popular among some Russians and is one Biden has tried to avoid. The president\u2019s visit only served to expose growing opposition to the war among conservative Republicans at home \u2013 which, if not yet near the levels that could force him to desert Ukraine, is sufficient to raise concerns about the size of future aid packages and what a new president after 2024 \u2013 Trump or a GOP leader who shares his \u201cAmerica First\u201d tendencies \u2013 could mean for Ukraine. The most glaring difference between Biden and Zelensky lies in the kind of weapons the US president is willing to provide. The government in Kyiv is ratcheting up its campaign for the West to send F-16 jets and is now getting increasing buy-in from some influential bipartisan members of Congress. Biden has so far declined to agree to the request, which gets to the heart of a dilemma that defines his war strategy: How far to go to help Kyiv win while avoiding a direct clash between the West and Russia. Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, complained on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday that Washington had taken too long to send game-changing weapons to Ukraine in the past and should not make the same mistake with warplanes. Asked if the Biden administration was now considering the dispatch of F-16 fighter planes, the Texas Republican replied: \u201cI hope so,\u201d and added, \u201cI think the momentum is building for this to happen.\u201d Sending US-made jets to Ukraine could be even more sensitive than the dispatch of the tanks to which the president just agreed. This is because they would enhance Ukraine\u2019s capacity to potentially strike at Russian jets and air defense systems inside Russia. The use of NATO aircraft in such operations \u2013 even with Ukrainian pilots \u2013 could prompt the Kremlin to conclude the alliance has directly intervened in the war, increasing the risk of a disastrous escalation of the conflict Biden has tried to avoid. But retired US Brig. Gen. Steve Anderson told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow Monday that Biden\u2019s visit came at another turning point in the war. \u201cThis is a great show of leadership by President Biden. Good leaders always go to the sound of the guns.\u201d But, Anderson added: \u201cThe United States needs to make a decision. Are we in it to ensure the Ukrainians simply not lose? Or are we in it so they can actually win?\u201d Hear retired brigadier general explain 'significance' of Biden's visit to Ukraine Less importantly globally but still significantly, Biden\u2019s trip to Ukraine had domestic political implications. A grueling and dangerous journey that required energy and endurance felt like a jab at critics who question whether Biden should be contemplating a reelection race at the age of 80. And like Biden\u2019s State of the Union address earlier this month, his stagecraft infuriated the most extreme wing of the Republican Party, which Biden has said is a danger to US democracy and values. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, quickly slammed Biden for journeying to Ukraine and other GOP figures accused him of caring more for Kyiv\u2019s borders than those in the US. \u201cThis is incredibly insulting. Today on our President\u2019s Day, Joe Biden, the President of the United States chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine\u2019s government and war. I can not express how much Americans hate Joe Biden,\u201d Greene said in a tweet. There are many Americans on the right who agree that Biden has not done enough to secure the southern border and the issue will be at the center of the 2024 election. But Greene\u2019s comment did not just exemplify the deterioration in civility in US politics. It was revealing from a pro-Trump Republican who has been supportive of the insurrectionists who tried to destroy American democracy on January 6, 2021. There may be nothing more presidential than standing for the foundational US values of freedom and democracy and the right of a people to repel tyranny enforced at the point of the gun from a more powerful foreign oppressor whose fight for independence mirrors America\u2019s own.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has made freedom his calling card, but some conservatives have become skeptical of how liberally the Republican leader is using government power to impose his will. Among GOP donors, leading conservative voices and even some supporters, there is a growing concern that DeSantis has overstepped in his fight against \u201cwokeness\u201d as he seeks to shore up conservative support ahead of a highly anticipated 2024 campaign for president. Several potential rivals for the GOP nomination have seized on DeSantis\u2019 brash approach and top-heavy governing style to draw sharp contrasts with the popular Republican. As Florida state lawmakers met earlier this month to hand DeSantis new authority over Disney World \u2013 punishment for the company\u2019s opposition to a measure restricting certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity \u2013 Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire took a shot at the power grab. \u201cI\u2019m a principled free-market conservative,\u201d said Sununu, who is also weighing a bid for president. \u201cFor others out there that think that the government should be penalizing your business because they disagree with you politically, that isn\u2019t very conservative.\u201d Ron DeSantis can now make his agenda a reality ahead of a possible 2024 announcement Even among would-be allies, DeSantis has made critics. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a right-of-center First Amendment group that argued for White nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s right to speak on a Florida campus, has joined DeSantis in opposing diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, programs. Nevertheless, the group has repeatedly criticized Florida\u2019s heavy-handed approach to forcing conservative beliefs on universities and is suing the state over the Stop WOKE Act, a DeSantis-backed measure that legislated how professors teach certain topics. \u201cYou cannot censor your way to freedom of expression,\u201d said Will Creeley, FIRE\u2019s legal director. \u201cYou cannot trade one orthodoxy for another. What we\u2019ve seen recently in Florida is a troubling willingness to do just that.\u201d DeSantis, though, has no shown no signs of halting. In a little over a month since he was sworn in for a second term, DeSantis has settled a score with Disney, threatened to end Advanced Placement classes in Florida, took over a small liberal arts college and vowed to put guardrails on how banks lend money. He has punished political enemies, disrupted institutions, consolidated power and imposed his will on businesses \u2013 all in the name of stopping \u201cwokeness.\u201d His political committee did not respond to a request for comment on Sununu\u2019s remarks. But DeSantis has defended his approach in the past. \u201cCorporatism is not the same as free enterprise, and I think too many Republicans have viewed limited government to basically mean whatever is best for corporate America is how we want to do the economy,\u201d the Florida governor said at a speech last year at the National Conservatism Conference. \u201cMy view is, you know, obviously free enterprise is the best economic system, but that is a means to an end.\u201d While the record DeSantis is building is almost sure to play well with many GOP primary voters, a sense of concern is palpable, particularly on matters of race, among some Republicans who are supportive of the governor. DeSantis says Florida requires African American history. Advocates say the state is failing that mandate \u201cBeing perceived as racially insensitive is not a good place for him to be in the long term,\u201d a Republican supporter of DeSantis said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about an area of rising worry. The supporter pointed directly to the fight over an Advanced Placement course on African American studies and DeSantis\u2019 quarrel with the College Board, saying the governor could alienate some voters who would otherwise be supportive. Another Republican fundraiser close to the governor told CNN that there is concern DeSantis is going overboard with \u201canti-woke stuff\u201d but added: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta win the primary first.\u201d DeSantis is so far drawing the most support from Republicans looking to move on from former President Donald Trump, according to recent polls. Some have suggested DeSantis could be Trump without the baggage of his first term, his two campaigns and his post-presidency obsession with the 2020 election. For his part, DeSantis has privately told supporters he believes Trump\u2019s divisiveness and addiction to political drama distracted from advancing his agenda. Trump but more effective, is how some around the governor have outlined his path to defeating the former president in a primary. But Republicans voters have yet to be introduced to many potential contenders for the party nomination. Meanwhile, outside groups such as the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity have signaled they intend to get involved in the primary. Frayda Levin, a member of the Club for Growth\u2019s board of directors, said there is great interest in DeSantis but she is increasingly concerned that he has become \u201ctoo heavy-handed\u201d in his pursuit of hot-button social issues. DeSantis is one of six Republicans invited to a Club for Growth donor summit in Florida as the conservative organization distances itself further from Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley are also invited. \u201cI\u2019m a genuine libertarian; I\u2019m kind of a live-and-let-live kind of girl,\u201d Levin told CNN. She said she has no problem with candidates espousing strongly held personal beliefs on social issues but said she objects to DeSantis \u201cputting the power of his state behind his socially conservative views.\u201d DeSantis\u2019 pugilistic style has become a frequent topic of debate among free-market conservatives who believe the government shouldn\u2019t interfere with businesses. DeSantis has often intervened if he accuses a business of running afoul of his vision of freedom. He instigated a standoff with the cruise line industry during the pandemic over their vaccine policies, banned businesses from requiring masks and vaccines, and championed a bill that restricted how businesses train workers around topics such as race and gender. \u201cDeSantis is always talking about he was not demanding that businesses do things, but he was telling the cruise lines what they had to do,\u201d former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a fellow Republican, said of DeSantis last year. Hogan has remained critical of the Florida governor as he weighs entering the mix for the Republican nomination. Meanwhile, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, another potential GOP contender, has also compared her Covid19 record against DeSantis in ways that suggest Florida was too hands-on \u2013 for ideologically disparate reasons. Noem said Friday it was her state, not Florida, that \u201cset an example of freedom\u201d by refusing to shut down at all. Florida, which DeSantis has called a Citadel of Freedom, closed schools, bars and theme parks and restricted other economic activity early in the pandemic. DeSantis signs bill expanding controversial migrant transportation program DeSantis has built his political persona around protecting freedoms. He dubbed his 2022 spending plan the \u201cFreedom First Budget\u201d and rebranded this year\u2019s financial blueprint as the \u201cFramework for Freedom.\u201d He pitched the tourism slogan \u201cVacation to Freedom\u201d during the pandemic and \u201cFreedom over Faucism\u201d is a frequent applause line in his speeches. On election night last fall, he stood victorious behind a podium adorned with a sign: \u201cFreedom Lives Here.\u201d But his approach has often included more government programs (creating an office to pursue voter fraud and a new program to conduct missions to surveil, house and transport migrants from border states to Democratic jurisdictions), more regulation (dictating bank lending practices) or flexing government power in unprecedented manners (ousting an elected state prosecutor). \u201cI\u2019m troubled by this trend, because what I think the interpretation will be is that this is working,\u201d Katherine Mangu-Ward, the editor-in-chief of the libertarian magazine Reason, said in a recent podcast episode centered around DeSantis\u2019 tactics. \u201cDeSantis is raising his profile every single week. He is putting himself in a better position to potentially win the presidency. And he is doing it through indiscriminate use of state power, not only to achieve kind of broader ends, but also just to score points.\u201d \u201cThat is not a good way to run a state. That is not a good way to run a country,\u201d she added. DeSantis\u2019 allies have pushed back against the growing chatter. Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, contended on Twitter recently that the governor was using his power as an elected leader \u2013 a job he was reelected to with a historical 19-point victory in November. DeSantis last month appointed Rufo to the board of New College, a small liberal arts school that the governor has targeted for a drastic overhaul to become a more conservative university. Gov. DeSantis' conservative takeover of a liberal arts college could silence diversity, critics say \u201cThe complaint about using \u2018state power,\u2019 meaning constitutionally-mandated democratic governance, to correct the ideological corruption of *public universities,* i.e., state institutions funded by taxpayers, is ridiculous,\u201d Rufo tweeted. \u201cAmounts to \u2018the people can\u2019t regulate the state.\u2019\u201d And even where there is apprehension among allies, DeSantis has not necessarily lost support. Ken Griffin, the billionaire hedge fund owner of Citadel and a major DeSantis donor, said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d last year by the governor\u2019s move against Disney. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate Gov. DeSantis going after Disney\u2019s tax status,\u201d Griffin said at the time. \u201cIt can be portrayed or feel or look like retaliation. And I believe that the people who serve our nation need to rise above these moments in time in their conduct and behavior.\u201d But later in 2022, Griffin touted DeSantis\u2019 \u201ctremendous record\u201d in an interview with Politico and suggested he would back the Florida governor in the GOP primary for president. \u201cWould I support him? The bigger question is, is he going to run?\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThat bridge has to be crossed.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression\u2019s new name.",

            "article_content": "Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United States ambassador to the United Nations, launched her bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Tuesday. But the primary is still in its early stages, and it could take months before the field fully rounds into form and candidates make more than occasional visits to states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina that will kick off the GOP\u2019s nominating process. Haley could stand alone for weeks or even months as the party\u2019s only official rival to former President Donald Trump. Here\u2019s a look at who\u2019s in and who is considering a 2024 run for the Republican nomination: Donald Trump: The former president officially launched his campaign in November, days after the midterm elections. And he never really stopped running after 2020, continuing to hold campaign-style rallies with supporters. Nikki Haley: Haley launched her presidential campaign Tuesday. It was a shift from her previous insistence she would not run against Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership to rediscover fiscal responsibility, secure our border and strengthen our country, our pride and our purpose,\u201d she said in a video announcing her bid. Ron DeSantis: The Florida governor emerged as the top alternative to Trump in many conservatives\u2019 eyes after his dominant reelection victory. A DeSantis announcement is likely months away, with Florida currently in the middle of its legislative session. But his memoir, accompanied by a media blitz, will drop at the end of February, and top advisers are building a political infrastructure. Mike Pence: The former vice president\u2019s split with Trump over the events of January 6, 2021, kicked off a consistent return to political travel. He has made clear that he believes the GOP will move on from Trump. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have new leadership in this party and in this country,\u201d Pence told CBS in January. Tim Scott: The South Carolina senator would make a second Palmetto State Republican in the 2024 field if, as expected, he enters the race in the near future. Scott is building a political infrastructure, including hiring for a super PAC, and is set to visit Iowa for an event his team billed as focused on \u201cfaith in America.\u201d Ted Cruz: The Texas senator and 2016 GOP contender has not ruled out another presidential bid. But he is also seeking reelection in 2024. \u201cI think there will be plenty of time to discuss the 2024 presidential race. I\u2019m running for reelection to the Senate,\u201d he told the CBS affiliate in Dallas in February. Glenn Youngkin: The Virginia governor\u2019s 2021 victory offered Republicans a new playbook focused on parental power in education. His political travel, including stops for a series of Republican gubernatorial candidates last year, makes clear Youngkin has ambitions beyond Virginia. He faced a setback to his push for a 15-week abortion ban when Democrats won a state senate special election earlier this year, expanding their narrow majority. Chris Sununu: The New Hampshire governor\u2019s timeline isn\u2019t clear, but he recently established a political action committee that borrowed his state\u2019s motto: \u201cLive Free or Die.\u201d He has positioned himself as a strong Trump opponent and alternative within the GOP. He would also start with the advantage of being universally known in an early-voting state. \u201cI think America as a whole is looking for results-driven leadership that calls the balls and strikes like they see them and is super transparent,\u201d Sununu told Axios this week. Kristi Noem: The South Dakota governor who won reelection in November has certainly cultivated a national profile, becoming a regular at conservative gatherings and donor confabs. But she hasn\u2019t committed to a presidential run. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that I need to run for president,\u201d she told CBS in January. Greg Abbott: The Texas governor who cruised past a 2020 presidential contender, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, to win his third term in November is unlikely to make any official 2024 moves until his state\u2019s legislative session wraps up at the end of May. He told Fox News in January that a 2024 run \u201cis it\u2019s not something I\u2019m ruling in right now. I\u2019m focused on Texas, period.\u201d Larry Hogan: The former Maryland governor is another Trump opponent. He told Fox News he is giving a 2024 run \u201cvery serious consideration.\u201d Chris Christie: The former New Jersey governor is one of several 2024 GOP prospects headed to Texas for a private donor gathering in late February, along with Pence, Haley, Scott, Sununu and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Christie said on ABC earlier this year he doesn\u2019t believe Trump could beat President Joe Biden in 2024. Asa Hutchinson: The former Arkansas governor is a rare Republican from a deep-red state who has been willing to criticize Trump. Now weeks removed from office, he also doesn\u2019t have the at-home responsibilities facing other governors. He told CBS that he\u2019ll decide on a 2024 by \u201cprobably April.\u201d He said he believes voters are \u201clooking for someone that is not going to be creating chaos, but also has got the record of being a governor, of lowering taxes.\u201d Mike Pompeo: Trump\u2019s secretary of state and the former Kansas congressman said during a tour for his new book, \u201cNever Give an Inch: Fighting for the America I Love,\u201d that he would decide on a presidential run in the coming months. He\u2019s been among the Republicans most openly considering a run, traveling to early-voting states for more than a year. Liz Cheney: The former Wyoming congresswoman who emerged as the foremost GOP critic of Trump\u2019s lies about widespread election fraud lost her House seat to a Trump-backed primary challenger. She launched a political action committee last year and made clear she intends to try to purge the GOP of Trump\u2019s influence. But what that means in the context of a potential 2024 bid is not yet clear. Will Hurd: The former Texas congressman who represented a border district recently traveled to New Hampshire, an early-voting state, though it\u2019s not clear whether or when he would enter the race. \u201cI always have an open mind about how to serve my country,\u201d he told Fox News. Others to keep an eye on: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who fended off a Trump-backed primary challenge on the way to reelection last year, has added political staffers and is sometimes mentioned as a vice presidential prospect. Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley have both said they will not run for president in 2024 \u2013 but things can change, and both had also taken steps to build their national profiles. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton has teased a run as a Trump foil.",

            "article_content": "Former South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley announced Tuesday in a video that she will run for president in 2024, becoming the first major rival to challenge former President Donald Trump for the GOP nomination. \u201cThe Washington establishment has failed us over and over and over again. It\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership to rediscover fiscal responsibility, secure our border and strengthen our country, our pride and our purpose,\u201d Haley, who is expected to deliver remarks Wednesday in Charleston at a campaign launch event, said in the video. Haley served as US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump. The former president, who announced his bid last year, recently appeared to bless her entrance into the race, telling reporters that she had called to tell him she was considering a campaign launch and that he had said, \u201cYou should do it.\u201d In pictures: Nikki Haley's career in politics Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, opened the video talking about how she felt \u201cdifferent\u201d growing up in Bamberg, South Carolina. \u201cThe railroad tracks divided the town by race. I was the proud daughter of Indian immigrants. Not Black, not White. I was different. But my mom would always say your job is not to focus on the differences but the similarities. And my parents reminded me and my siblings every day how blessed we were to live in America,\u201d Haley said. If successful in the primary, Haley would be the first woman and the first Asian American nominated by the Republican Party for president. A former president of the National Association of Women Business Owners, she was first elected to the South Carolina House in 2004. Six years later, she became the first woman elected as governor of the state in 2010 and was the youngest governor in the nation when she took office in 2011. She resigned in the middle of her second term to become Trump\u2019s ambassador to the UN \u2013 a role she served in until the end of 2018. During her video announcement, Haley touted her record as a twice-elected governor of South Carolina and her leadership in the state after nine people were fatally shot at a historically Black church in Charleston in 2015. After the shooting, Haley called for the removal of the Confederate flag from the grounds of the Statehouse. She also leaned into her foreign policy experience in her announcement and referenced her time as UN ambassador, saying she has \u201cseen evil.\u201d \u201cSome look at our past as evidence that America\u2019s founding principles are bad. They say the promise of freedom is just made up. Some think our ideas are not just wrong, but racist and evil. Nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d Haley said. \u201cI have seen evil. In China they commit genocide. In Iran they murder their own people for challenging the government. And when a woman tells you about watching soldiers throw her baby into a fire it puts things into perspective. Even on our worst day, we are blessed to live in America.\u201d \u201cSome people look at America and see vulnerability,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThe socialist left sees an opportunity to rewrite history. China and Russia are on the march. They all think we can be bullied, kicked around. You should know this about me: I don\u2019t put up with bullies and when you kick back it hurts them more if you\u2019re wearing heels.\u201d Haley will likely face stiff competition in this lane from other potential GOP candidates such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who are all said to be weighing 2024 runs and could also appeal to conservative Republicans looking to turn the page from Trump. Some Republican strategists say a big Republican primary field would be advantageous to Trump, who still enjoys significant support among the party base, and could splinter the vote, allowing the former president to walk away with the nomination. Haley has often attempted to walk a fine line between allying with Trump and distancing herself enough to appeal to his more moderate critics. She left the Trump administration in 2018 on good terms with the then-president \u2013 a marked contrast from other former Trump officials who have publicly fallen out with their onetime boss. Trump on Tuesday weighed in on Haley\u2019s announcement, saying in a statement to CNN, \u201cEven though Nikki Haley said, \u2018I would never run against my President, he was a great President, the best President in my lifetime,\u2019 I told her she should follow her heart and do what she wants to do. I wish her luck!\u201d Trump was inaccurately referencing a statement Haley made in April 2021 when she said she \u201cwould not run if President Trump ran,\u201d a sentiment she later walked back as she called for a new generation of leadership. While Trump said publicly Tuesday that he wished Haley luck, he has privately expressed annoyance that the woman he once tapped to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations would challenge him. But Trump has remained the most anxious about another challenger: DeSantis. In recent weeks, Trump has asked multiple advisers about creating a new disparaging nickname for his potential rival, privately suggesting that he target DeSantis\u2019s weight instead of referring to him as \u201cRon Desanctimonious.\u201d As Trump has vented about Haley\u2019s run, some advisers have reminded him how it could benefit him if he faces multiple Republican challenges in the race. South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who was endorsed by Haley when Trump supported her Republican opponent, told CNN Tuesday she was also worried about the size of the primary field. \u201cI have concerns if there are too many people on the ballot by the time it gets to South Carolina that it lessens the chances of anyone else coming out in this thing,\u201d Mace said. Haley filed to run for president with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A deepening national security mystery is threatening a political storm after US fighter jets scrambled three days in a row to shoot down a trio of unidentified aerial objects high over the North American continent. The flurry of attacks on the unknown crafts came a week after the highly public tracking and ultimate downing of a Chinese balloon suspected of carrying out surveillance. Now, the thin details trickling out of the Pentagon and Capitol Hill about are making an already highly unusual international episode even more bizarre and confusing. No one \u2013 not the White House, the Pentagon or the government of Canada, whose airspace has also been infringed \u2013 seems able to say exactly what is going on with these latest downed crafts. This raises questions for top military brass and US spy agencies as well as for the potential safety of civilian aviation. And it creates an information vacuum that Republicans are again using to question President Joe Biden\u2019s leadership. The intrigue is also unfolding against a tense global situation, with already difficult relations with rising superpower China becoming ever more hostile and with the US leading the West in an effective proxy war against Russia in Ukraine. \u201cWhat\u2019s gone on in the last two weeks or so, 10 days, has been nothing short of craziness,\u201d Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS, hours before an airborne object was shot down over Lake Huron. \u201cThe military needs to have a plan to not only determine what\u2019s out there, but (to) determine the dangers that go with it,\u201d Tester said. With the North American Aerospace Defense Command on heightened alert, US fighters have now blasted three objects out of the skies since Friday following the shooting down of the Chinese balloon off the South Carolina coast on February 4: Even at the height of last century\u2019s Cold War, when US jets often headed off Soviet aircraft testing North American and European defenses, pilots weren\u2019t typically sent off to shoot down unidentified objects over the US and Canada. It\u2019s not normal for Americans to settle down for the Super Bowl with their president firing off orders to blast unknown objects out of the North American sky. In fact, NORAD commander Gen. Glen VanHerck said recent objects shot down were likely the first \u201ckinetic action\u201d that NORAD or the US Northern Command had taken against an airborne object over US airspace. So the events of the last few days do provoke serious national security and political questions that stretch far beyond the often narrow political battle in Washington, and that can only be assessed once more details are understood. They include: The political blame game is heating up. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, linked the incursions of US air space to Republican claims that Biden is failing to protect the southern border and complained that senior officials were not briefing Congress enough. And he also adopted a novel critique of Biden given claims that the president didn\u2019t act quickly enough before. \u201cThey do appear somewhat trigger-happy, although this is certainly preferable to the permissive environment that they showed when the Chinese spy balloon was coming over some of our most sensitive sites,\u201d Turner told Jake Tapper. \u201cI think one thing that this shows is certainly the fallacy of the argument of the Biden administration saying that the height of the Chinese balloon caused them to have no concern because certainly, as we know, whatever goes up can come down.\u201d China has accused the US of \u201cillegally\u201d flying high-altitude balloons into its airspace more than 10 times since January 2022. The White House responded to those claims by saying the allegation is false. \u201cAny claim that the US government operates surveillance balloons over the PRC is false. It is China that has a high-altitude surveillance balloon program for intelligence collection, that it has used to violate the sovereignty of the US and over 40 countries across 5 continents,\u201d a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Adrienne Watson, wrote on Twitter. Canadian Retired Maj. Gen. Scott Clancy, former director of operations at NORAD and former deputy commander of the Alaskan NORAD Region, said on Monday he does not believe China is behind the unidentified objects that have been shot down in recent days. He explained that it could be a \u201cconfluence of a distinctive activity by our adversaries to test the systems.\u201d \u201cIt smells to me, as the guy who was directed to conduct operations to defend North America, I\u2019d be very suspicious,\u201d Clancy said on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019d be on high alert to make sure that all of our adversaries are being countered.\u201d Biden, who didn\u2019t address the new intrusions at a black-tie event with state governors on Saturday, has yet to speak to Americans in person about the trio of incidents over the weekend. But a senior official sought to play down concerns over the shoot-downs on Sunday evening. \u201cBecause we have not yet been able to definitively assess what these recent objects are, we have acted out of an abundance of caution to protect our security and interests,\u201d said Melissa Dalton, assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and hemispheric affairs. \u201cThe spy balloon from (China) was of course different in that we knew precisely what (it) was. These most recent objects do not pose a kinetic military threat, but their path in proximity to sensitive (defense) sites and the altitude that they were flying could be a hazard to civilian aviation and thus raised concerns,\u201d Dalton added. The lack of specificity is unlikely to quell speculation or partisan maneuvering in Washington. At the start of a new presidential election cycle and in a polarized political age when social media magnifies conspiracy theories, this odd series of incidents is heaping fresh pressure on Biden following recriminations after his decision to wait until the Chinese balloon had crossed the country before shooting it down over water. New speculation and criticism could be premature as officials work to fully understand the sequence of events and more about the objects. CNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand reported on Sunday that NORAD had recently readjusted the filters it uses to sift data, which had previously concentrated on spotting fast-moving objects below a certain altitude. Early warning filters had previously been set to avoid picking up other objects, including birds and weather balloons, a source briefed on the matter said. CNN security analyst Juliette Kayyem said that this opening up of the \u201caperture\u201d means that more objects are being identified. \u201cThey are getting lots of positives that they did not get before. Most of that is going to be airplanes, whatever it may be,\u201d said Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t answer now is, is this bigger aperture picking up lots of stuff that has essentially been forgiven, around in the skies, because it didn\u2019t pose a threat, or is it part of something organized for whatever surveillance?\u201d It\u2019s possible that in a unique, fast-moving situation, the government may not know much more than it is saying. But the piecemeal emergence of details is adding to the confusion. On issues including the Chinese balloon and the discovery of classified vice presidential documents at Biden\u2019s home and office, the administration has sometimes struggled to control a media narrative to its own political detriment. There was more confusion on Sunday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the two objects shot down over Alaska and the Yukon were balloons but smaller than the original Chinese intruder, after saying he had earlier been briefed by Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser. The US Defense Department, however, later clarified that those two objects \u201cdid not closely resemble the PRC balloon\u201d shot down last week. There are also signs that federal lawmakers may be getting information from military and local authorities that is incomplete, risking further confusion or politicization about what is going on. Republican Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana appeared to make a direct link Sunday on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d between the Chinese balloon and the latest objects, even if there is no confirmation so far that they are connected. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give me much safe feelings knowing that these devices are smaller,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very concerned with the cumulative data that is being collected. \u2026 I need some answers, and the American people need answers.\u201d Such speculation may be premature. But fierce political debate over the balloon has clearly changed Biden\u2019s tolerance threshold for unknown aerial objects. It\u2019s now a case of shoot first, investigate later.

            "article_content": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders may have a point \u2013 America\u2019s new political choice really could be between \u201cnormal or crazy.\u201d But after a wild week in Washington, it\u2019s fair to ask who is on each side of the line the Arkansas governor drew in her Republican response to President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address. Two days later, it seems Republicans triggered their own trap. The unspoken purpose of Biden\u2019s theatrical delivery on Tuesday night, and much of his presidency, is to ask Americans who the real extremists are. And the GOP\u2019s behavior before, during and after his big night appears to be offering an emphatic answer \u2013 to moderate voters at least \u2013 as Republicans tolerate election deniers and use their investigatory muscle on topics that aren\u2019t top of mind for most Americans. Sanders spoke moments after Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was on her feet yelling \u201cliar\u201d at Biden, with the House chamber sounding more like a heckler-filled late-night comedy club than a solemn state occasion. New House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was seen trying to shush his ruder lawmakers, but he was among those Republicans who voted not to certify Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory over false claims of fraud. And it was McCarthy who embraced ex-President Donald Trump after his baseless claims of a stolen election incited an unprecedented insurrection at the US Capitol. More recently, he appeased untamed elements of his party to squeeze into power last month. Biden brings his battle with Republicans on the road after contentious State of the Union The new House majority is also grappling with the distraction of serial fabulist George Santos, the New York congressman who was caught lying about his education, his job resume and his family background. His fellow New York Republican, freshman Rep. Nick LaLota, told CNN on Wednesday, \u201cEvery time I have to come to something like this and talk about George Santos, I can\u2019t talk about what Republicans ought to be doing instead.\u201d Meanwhile, new Republican-led oversight hearings \u2013 including one on Wednesday apparently designed to prove that some combination of Twitter, the FBI and Biden stole the 2020 election \u2013 have further erased the line between conservative opinion TV and governance. The all-day session featured the kind of histrionic questioning and grandstanding, which verged on bullying of the witnesses, that delights the GOP\u2019s base and runs on a loop on right-wing media. But if anything, it undermined the premise that a massive media, deep-state swamp conspired against Trump as witnesses testified that there was no order from the FBI to temporarily suppress a New York Post story about a laptop purportedly belonging to the president\u2019s son, Hunter. Another House hearing on Thursday, the first of a series into the alleged \u201cweaponization\u201d of the government against conservatives, will again fuel an impression the GOP is trying to build scandals from right-wing talking points. While such showdowns allow party leaders to fire up vital base voters and cook up a general stench of scandal that, even if unproven, could harm the Biden administration, they risk highlighting the GOP\u2019s most extreme, media-hungry personalities and alienating moderate voters. Of course, political normality is in the eye of the beholder. Sanders argued that Biden had surrendered to a \u201cwoke mob that can\u2019t even tell you what a woman is\u201d and that the country is in the grip of a left-wing cultural purge. The GOP used the national television audience to recommit to the hardline \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d base strategy pushed by Trump, whom Sanders served as press secretary in the White House. But her strategy did not come in isolation. For many conservatives, liberal policies on social, economic and foreign policy may well be viewed as \u201ccrazy.\u201d And Democrats have had their own issues with extremists in recent years, including left-wingers who once called for \u201cdefunding the police\u201d \u2013 a position that turned into a huge political liability for their party in successive elections. But while Sanders may be adopting a shrewd approach for a rising star in a party that often rewards far-right candidates in primaries, it would seem to fly in the face of lessons of the midterm elections, when voters in swing states rejected far-right extremism. Republicans repeatedly interrupt Biden during State of the Union address Some Republicans may feel aggrieved at Biden\u2019s claim they want to sunset Social Security and Medicare, especially since McCarthy has said that\u2019s not on the table in debt ceiling talks, although some prominent Republicans have suggested such a step. And McCarthy\u2019s comment on Fox that it was one of the most partisan State of the Union addresses he\u2019d ever heard was not totally wide of the mark. But the president again positioned himself as the bulwark between more moderate Americans and the excess of what he has called \u201cultra MAGA\u201d Republicans \u2013 a tactic he used especially successfully in the midterms. This is why Biden\u2019s strategy goaded McCarthy\u2019s most radical followers into acting out on Tuesday night after saying Americans didn\u2019t want to see fighting in Congress. McCarthy, meanwhile, dodged efforts from reporters to get him to comment on the performance of Greene, with whom he has developed a strong political relationship. While he had hoped to avoid a public spectacle of extremism with millions watching on TV, his hopes of keeping his job long term rely on radicals like Greene and her wilder colleagues. This narrow grip on power thanks to a minuscule majority is one reason why McCarthy has also not repudiated Santos, who is expected to face a House ethics probe. The sight of an apparently weak speaker unable to keep order in the chamber as Biden spoke \u2013 a scene that encapsulated the collapse of civility in the Trump-era of GOP politics \u2013 bodes ill for the future. Tuesday\u2019s performance seeded new doubts that \u2013 even if McCarthy could somehow reach a deal with Biden on cutting spending in return for lifting the government\u2019s borrowing limit \u2013 the California Republican would be able to sell anything but an absolutist position to his members on a clash that threatens to pitch the US economy into a crisis. Greene told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Wednesday that she wasn\u2019t sorry for her poor manners during Biden\u2019s speech, even though she provided Democrats with the exact image they most want to highlight. She said she was \u201cpissed off\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t clap for liars.\u201d Former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN on Tuesday night that Greene\u2019s antics encapsulated a choice for Americans between \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201cstability.\u201d Not every Republican is tolerating the party\u2019s incivility. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney went where McCarthy has failed to go, telling Santos he had no place in the House. LaLota, meanwhile, in his interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, stressed how the New York Republican had become a distraction from the party\u2019s priorities. \u201cWe want to talk about putting our economy back on the right track, securing our border, hold the administration accountable \u2013 these are the things that Republicans campaigned on, these are the things that Republicans want to govern on,\u201d LaLota said. Given the Biden White House\u2019s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Covid-19 pandemic and the border crisis, there is plenty for House Republican chairmen to sink their teeth into. There is no reason why a genuine investigation into Biden\u2019s finances \u2013 and those of his son, who is under federal investigation \u2013 should not be part of this oversight either. But Wednesday\u2019s House Oversight hearing showed how politicized the investigations have already become, and raised questions about the underlying question at issue: claims that the FBI forced Twitter to temporarily block users from sharing a New York Post story in 2020 regarding Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop. Twitter execs acknowledge mistakes with Hunter Biden laptop story but say no government involvement House Oversight Chair James Comer warned of a \u201ccoordinated cover-up by Big Tech, the Swamp, and mainstream news\u201d to suppress a story that could hurt Biden. Former senior officials from Twitter admitted that the social media network made a mistake in suppressing the story \u2013 on the grounds that they were worried it was based on the same kind of foreign misinformation that had tainted the 2016 election. But they repeatedly testified that they had received no orders from the FBI to do so, undermining claims by top Republicans that the bureau tried to censor a story that could hurt Biden in the election. The hearing also appeared to be partially rooted in a misperception that a private company is infringing First Amendment free speech protections if it chooses not to carry certain material on its platform. The supposed case also rested on documents released by the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, which Republicans say prove there was collusion between the company and the FBI. But the material doesn\u2019t appear to prove that contention. CNN has reported that the allegations are unsupported and a half-dozen tech executives and senior staff, along with multiple federal officials familiar with the matter, also denied any such directive was given. Still, the lack of a smoking gun doesn\u2019t mean the hearing was a waste of time for some Republicans trying to cloud the Biden administration in the appearance of scandal. Members did tease out that some Twitter executives disdained Trump, even if they didn\u2019t suppress the story for political reasons. And for members like Greene and Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, berating supposed deep-state witnesses keeps the clicks coming on conservative media and the fundraising machine turning.

            "article_content": "Rep. Jim Jordan, one of the GOP\u2019s most vocal partisans and now the chair of the powerful Judiciary Committee, started a recent meeting on the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the federal government with a surprising move: He urged caution. Rather than issuing a series of partisan attack lines about the so-called \u201cDeep State,\u201d Jordan took a low-key approach \u2013 handing out binders of reading materials and cautioning members to be meticulous about who they haul in for interviews, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to get all the facts on the table for the American people, because that\u2019s always the first step,\u201d Jordan told CNN after the Jan. 27 meeting. Jordan allies have gone out of their way in recent weeks to claim the usually hyper-partisan attack dog wants to take a more methodical approach in turning up the heat on his primary target \u2013 the Biden Justice Department. The Ohio Republican, they said, believes amassing more evidence before mounting public pressure could help him squeeze more from DOJ and boost his credibility in the long run. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be methodical,\u201d Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, chairwoman of the House Republican conference and a member of the so-called weaponization subcommittee told CNN. \u201cJim knows the different levers to use.\u201d But around Washington, skepticism abounds over whether a longtime Trump loyalist, partisan firebrand and staunch election denier can transform into a serious committee chair \u2013 let alone someone capable of heading a bipartisan investigation. \u201cBetter late than never!\u201d Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly, a newly-appointed member of the weaponization subcommittee, told CNN of Jordan\u2019s attempted rebrand. But Connolly, and other Democrats who spoke to CNN for this story, made clear they weren\u2019t holding their breath. \u201cIf he wants to turn a new leaf and be credible and methodical and try to get at the facts as opposed to wacko conspiracy theories and the latest news item propagated by right wing media \u2013 which he haunts I might add \u2013 that would be welcome,\u201d Connolly said before adding sarcastically, \u201cI\u2019m just shaking in anticipation to see it!\u201d On its face, Jordan\u2019s weaponization subcommittee presumes that for years the federal government has worked to thwart conservatives, a premise that already strains credulity among Democrats, many of whom are still fuming that Jordan stonewalled the subpoena for his testimony last year from the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. \u201cIf he was serious he would have honored the subpoena that was sent to him last Congress for January 6,\u201d said Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat and Judiciary committee member.  \u201cSo, I think he starts this Congress with zero credibility and has to prove otherwise.\u201d Membership of the weaponization subcommittee solidified this week, with Democrats naming nine members to go along with 12 Republicans, including Jordan as chair. Among the Democrats are some younger members with backgrounds as prosecutors, including at least one involved in Donald Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, a sign some interpret as Democrats girding for deeply partisan battles to come. Rep. Jordan: 'No' chance I become speaker Still, skeptics have noted some small signs that Jordan is attempting to be more bipartisan. When organizing the Judiciary committee for the first time, Jordan announced Wednesday that he had worked out a deal with the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Jerry Nadler, to allow Democrats a 24-hour heads-up before issuing a subpoena. Though Republicans on Judiciary and the weaponization subcommittee will still be able to unilaterally issue subpoenas, the announcement is a noted departure from Jordan\u2019s initial plan to keep Democrats entirely in the dark on subpoenas \u2013  a concession Nadler said he hopes is a sign the Republican majority will work with Democrats in good faith as the panel embarks on various investigations of the Biden administration. On Thursday, Jordan announced the subpanel\u2019s first hearing will be next week, but did not disclose the topic or the witnesses. Jordan\u2019s take-it-slow approach with DOJ appeared to be on display this week as the Judiciary committee officially kicked off its work. Jordan focused his fire on securing the southern border, the topic of the committee\u2019s first public hearing. He stayed out of the fray when members on the panel fought over the prospect of saying the pledge of allegiance at every meeting. And he stayed mum on the interview happening just one floor up, where committee staff were grilling a former FBI official behind closed doors as part of Jordan\u2019s efforts to probe alleged political bias at the FBI. Jordan has also for the most part deferred to his colleague House Oversight Chairman James Comer in pressing two of the sharpest attack lines against the president \u2013 the special counsel investigating Biden\u2019s retention of classified documents, and issues surrounding his son Hunter Biden, who is under criminal investigation for tax fraud. In recent weeks Comer has made a flurry of document and interview requests, burying the National Archives, the White House and the Penn Biden Center. Comer has also embraced the narrative that the classified documents case ties directly to Hunter Biden. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it on Oversight from a Biden family influence peddling deal and from the angle that we have legislative restriction over the National Archives\u201d Comer told CNN. According to Jordan\u2019s allies, it\u2019s better for Comer to own those issues, than it is for Jordan. \u201cWe\u2019re not sad that it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s thing\u201d one source told CNN of Comer\u2019s investigation into Hunter Biden. \u201cBy not doing that, it sort of preserves some legitimacy.\u201d Comer\u2019s barrage of document requests has been accompanied by regular cable news hits from Fox to NBC and CNN as he steps into the right-wing limelight leading the Oversight panel. If Jordan has waded cautiously into the Biden document drama, Comer dove in headfirst. \u201cIt\u2019s the reverse process for Comer, who is seen by those guys as very much, a kind of \u2018good old boy\u2019 McConnell-style politician,\u201d a Democratic lawmaker added, nodding to Comer\u2019s attempt to elevate his MAGA profile. A GOP source familiar with Jordan\u2019s strategy said, \u201cChairman Jordan has been strategic about the classified documents issue and has expressed to his colleagues there needs to be a careful and methodical way to conduct oversight. He has years of experience conducting congressional investigations and he has found this to be the best path forward.\u201d An early test will be what if any information Jordan extracts from the Justice Department about the Biden special counsel. Jordan told CNN last week he would consider a subpoena if the DOJ doesn\u2019t give his committee what they\u2019re demanding. Jordan\u2019s aides have said he\u2019s bracing for a long and brutal fight, part of the reason he\u2019s trying to be more thoughtful in his approach. \u201cWe\u2019ll issue the subpoenas and try to get the information and documents that we need,\u201d Jordan said, adding that he expects resistance from DOJ and the FBI. \u201cIf they give us the runaround, they give us the runaround.\u201d DOJ responded on Monday to Jordan\u2019s requests, telling him that it will not provide most of the information he requested about the ongoing special counsel investigation into Biden\u2019s handling of classified material until that probe is complete. Privately, Republican lawmakers acknowledge there\u2019s little they can to do force the Justice Department\u2019s compliance, acknowledging the limitations of working with a special counsel. \u201cWe push, they resist, we figure out how to push harder and they figure out how to resist and then we see who wins,\u201d GOP Rep. Chip Roy, who serves on Judiciary and the new subcommittee said of the battle ahead with DOJ. Democrats are waiting to see how Jordan handles the inevitable pushback from DOJ. \u201cJim Jordan knew all along that he wasn\u2019t entitled to disrupt ongoing criminal investigations,\u201d a Democratic aide familiar with the investigation told CNN. \u201cThe question is whether he will clutch his pearls and pretend to be outraged, or actually sit down and work with a Department that seems willing to give him at least some of the information he has requested,\u201d the aide said. Said Nadler, \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a strategy,\u201d The White House doesn\u2019t seem to be buying Jordan\u2019s change. A Biden administration official told CNN, \u201cJordan is launching a special committee to try to obstruct justice and interfere in law enforcement investigations,\u201d and added that Jordan\u2019s \u201ccredibility is in serious question, as he tries to weaponize his perch to attack his own political enemies. Rep. Mike Johnson, vice chair of the Republican Conference Committee, framed Jordan\u2019s actions in terms of the long game he is playing. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a time for aggression, but this is not a political exercise to us,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThis is not about political retribution. We\u2019ll be accused of all that, but this is a fact finding mission for us.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not fire, ready, aim,\u201d Rep. Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican, said of why Jordan is waiting to issue subpoenas on classified documents. \u201cYou want to very carefully gather your facts, where they lead. See where subpoenas may or may not be necessary. I think you\u2019ll see a very serious, methodical approach to this and that\u2019s why it will be successful.\u201d Once a thorn in the side of party leadership, known for his ultra-partisan rhetoric during the investigation into the Benghazi attacks and both impeachments of Trump, Jordan is now a key ally to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and leads one of the most powerful congressional committees. Jordan has long been a regular fixture on Fox News. But for the first time since 2019, Jordan appeared on NBC\u2019s flagship \u201cMeet the Press\u201d show on Sunday morning. \u201cJordan is obviously firmly anchored in that Freedom Caucus right-wing MAGA world. He\u2019s a close Trump confidant,\u201d said one Democratic lawmaker. \u201cHis effort, if he wants to do this, will be to try to create more credibility, especially outside of Fox News.\u201d Jordan has told CNN he wants to focus on what he believes are the \u201cdifferent levels of treatment\u201d that Biden and Trump received from the DOJ and FBI when the existence of classified documents emerged. \u201cThe Attorney General says the rules are the same for everyone. While the rules may be the same, but the application sure seems different. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to look at,\u201d Jordan said. Oversight panel member GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee told CNN that Jordan and Comer will need to draw clear lines and capitalize on the public pressure of the moment to address the classified documents issue. \u201cThey have a limited window of opportunity because just publicly the interest will drop, and you know we\u2019ll just be meeting over having meetings and nothing gets resolved. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they want,\u201d Burchett said. But he added, \u201cI hope that when all of the politics of it subsides that we can come up with some clear policies. I see this as an opportunity for some real bipartisan work.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A dual citizen of France and Canada pleaded guilty on Wednesday to sending letters containing homemade ricin to then-President Donald Trump at the White House and eight Texas law enforcement officials. Pascale Cecile Veronique Ferrier sent threatening letters containing the poison in September 2020, according to the plea agreement filed in a Washington, DC, federal court. According to the agreement, Ferrier made ricin at her home in Quebec, Canada, and put the poison in letters addressed to Trump and the Texas officials. The letters included references to a \u201cspecial gift\u201d and said that, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, I will find a better recipe for another poison,\u201d according to the agreement. In several letters, Ferrier wrote that she \u201cmight use my gun when I will be able to come.\u201d In her letter to Trump, Ferrier wrote, \u201cYou ruin USA and lead them to disaster. I have US cousins, then I don\u2019t want the next 4 years with you as President. Give up and remove your application for this election!\u201d Ferrier had previously been detained in Texas for several weeks in 2019 and chose to send letters containing ricin to law enforcement officials she thought were involved in her detention, the agreement says. After sending the letters from Canada, Ferrier was arrested when trying to cross the border into the US with a loaded gun, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and several other weapons, according to the department. Ferrier told border officials that she was wanted by the FBI for the letters, the agreement says. \u201cThis woman did not succeed in her efforts to poison numerous public officials in our district, but her actions still created fear and stress for many of these dedicated public servants,\u201d US Attorney Alamdar Hamdani said in a statement from the Justice Department. Ferrier will be sentenced on April 26. She faces over 21 years in prison if the court accepts the plea agreements.",

            "article_content": "Cascading revelations about New York Rep. George Santos\u2019 pattern of lies and deception are putting increased scrutiny on powerful New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the fourth-ranking House Republican and a vocal supporter of Santos during his 2022 campaign. Stefanik was a key validator for Santos in their shared home state and often touted the candidate in public and private forums. Several prominent GOP donors told CNN that they gave to Santos, who was largely unknown to them, because Stefanik, the state\u2019s most influential elected Republican and a prolific fundraiser, backed him. \u201cI would have never donated without Elise,\u201d said Ken Salamone, who gave $5,800 to Santos\u2019 campaign and more than $20,000 to his joint fundraising committee, after Stefanik\u2019s team reached out on his behalf. \u201cI assumed she did her homework. I always do my homework and didn\u2019t. Shame on me.\u201d Kristin Bianco, another Republican donor who told CNN she was swayed by Stefanik and other Republicans\u2019 support of Santos, said she cut off Santos after he falsely claimed to her that former President Donald Trump had endorsed him. \u201cHe was after me to become a big donor\u2026he was such a fraud,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI tried to warn people.\u201d Bianco gave Santos a total of $550 according to campaign records. Another donor, who attended a fundraising luncheon with Stefanik and Santos, confirmed to CNN through a representative that \u201che donated to George Santos because of Elise Stefanik\u2019s endorsement.\u201d \u201cCongresswoman Stefanik supported all GOP nominees in targeted New York seats just like every other New York Republican elected official, candidate, NRCC, NYGOP, and the entire House Republican leadership team,\u201d a Stefanik campaign spokesperson told CNN, adding that Stefanik was not \u201caware of the allegations (against Santos) prior to the New York Times reporting.\u201d Multiple Republican operatives in Washington and New York told CNN that they found it implausible that Stefanik had not been aware of Santos\u2019 falsehoods, given rumors about Santos had been passed around in GOP circles since at least the summer of 2021. \u201cStefanik\u2019s team was laser focused on electing Santos to Congress \u2013 more than just about any other race in the country,\u201d a senior Republican strategist involved in campaigns before the midterms said. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said last week that he \u201calways had a few questions about\u201d the veracity of Santos\u2019 resume. Still, he headlined a fundraiser for Santos in October, about five weeks before the election, according to a promotion of the event. Neither McCarthy, Stefanik, nor other prominent Republicans who have supported Santos are calling for him to resign. One source in Republican politics familiar with the dynamics of the situation told CNN that Stefanik \u201cwas an advocate throughout the process specific to (Santos) even when others had questions. No two ways about it she was a significant supporter of his.\u201d The source, who attributed Stefanik\u2019s support of Santos to a lack of due diligence and not a willful concealment of information, also said that a top political aide for Stefanik was involved in campaigning for Santos. Multiple sources told CNN that aide was closely advising Santos\u2019 campaign and involved in hiring people. The Stefanik spokesperson denied her aide had any involvement, saying, \u201cAt no point did any staff for Congresswoman Stefanik work or advise this candidate.\u201d A week ago, Democratic New York Reps. Ritchie Torres and Daniel Goldman, who have filed a complaint against Santos with the House Ethics Committee, wrote a letter urging Stefanik and other New York Republicans to \u201cproactively and forthrightly cooperate with all current and future investigations into Mr. Santos.\u201d \u201cIn order for the Ethics Committee to conduct a thorough investigation, and for Congress to ensure its members follow the law, it is imperative that Ms. Stefanik share with the Ethics Committee and the public everything that she and her top aide knew about Mr. Santos\u2019s web of deceit,\u201d the Democrats wrote. On Monday, Goldman reiterated his call for Stefanik to comply with the investigation into Santos and be transparent with voters. The uproar over Santos, a pariah to all but GOP House leadership, which seated him on two committees and needs him to help maintain their razor thin majority in the chamber, has metastasized in New York, where Republicans unleashed the Congressional \u201cred wave\u201d that eluded them in so many other states. The Nassau County Republican committee, along with GOP House members from neighboring and nearby districts, recently called on Santos to resign. \u201cHis lies were not mere fibs. He disgraced the House of Representatives,\u201d Nassau County GOP chairman Joseph G. Cairo said at a news conference last week. \u201cHe\u2019s not welcome here at Republican headquarters.\u201d The backlash spurred by the Santos drama threatens New York Republicans\u2019 credibility with voters and donors in and around a series of swing districts, including Santos\u2019 3rd, which encompasses parts of Long Island and Queens, that broke for the GOP last year and in local elections in 2021. After the election, the family member of another donor frustratedly asked Santos about the allegations first reported in The New York Times. In text messages reviewed by CNN, Santos responded by claiming he had been slandered. When the source pushed Santos to \u201crelease some proof\u202fto refute the work/school claims,\u201d Santos demurred. \u201cThe party heads are 100% cool with me being run over,\u201d he texted the donor. \u201cThe approach isn\u2019t mine, I\u2019m allowing the DC folks to handle this their way. They are the experts not me, or so I\u2019m told.\u201d On August 11, 2021, Stefanik tweeted out her endorsement of Santos. One of the posts included a link to a WinRed online fundraising page asking for donations which would benefit both her and Santos. \u201cMAJOR ENDORSEMENT ALERT Excited to endorse my friend and fellow America First conservative George Santos for Congress in #NY03,\u201d Stefanik wrote. \u201c@Santos4Congress will take on NYC liberal elites and bring a new generation of GOP leadership to NY and America. He has my full support!\u201d A little more than nine months later, on May 23, 2022, Stefanik reported on Twitter that she had helped raise more than six figures in campaign cash for Santos. \u201cWOW! Great lunch event for @Santos4Congress! We raised over $100,000 to help George FLIP #NY03 George has my complete and total endorsement and come November,\u201d tweeted Stefanik, borrowing the Trumpian phrase. \u201cNew Yorkers will send George to Congress! #SaveNewYork #SaveAmerica\u201d Santos in turn highlighted his endorsement from Stefanik as recently as Wednesday, featuring a picture of the pair together as the banner image on his Twitter account. It has since been changed. Santos\u2019 ability to fly under the radar for so long, multiple Republican operatives suggested, was aided by a series of unusual circumstances surrounding the midterm elections in New York. Having run once before, in 2020, when he lost in a landslide to then-Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi under the district\u2019s old border, Santos was widely viewed as an odd upstart who was unlikely to be competitive if he ran again \u2013 even with Republicans gaining momentum on Long Island. When Democrats\u2019 gerrymandered maps were released in February 2022, the district was redrawn to include parts of the Bronx and Westchester, effectively taking it off the map for the GOP. But the state\u2019s high court eventually struck down the gerrymandered map and appointed a \u201cspecial master\u201d to sketch new, more politically balanced borders. The fresh map, unveiled in May 2022, made headlines as Democrats descended into a feisty game of musical chairs, as incumbents were drawn into overlapping districts and as candidates who had announced runs based on the tossed map considered their options. Though the final redistricting lines benefited Republicans, their release so late into the campaign season, operatives said, condensed and complicated the candidate selection process. \u201cIn 2020 the Democrats had a strong district, they had a strong incumbent and people were not knocking down the door to run,\u201d Cairo, the county GOP chairman said earlier this month. The 2020 cycle, before the court\u2019s ruling looked even more bleak. \u201cNo elected officials were coming forward (to run).\u201d By then, Santos was effectively locked in as the Republican candidate. And as his race grew increasingly competitive, one New York-based GOP strategist said, the incentive to further probe his biography \u2013 and potentially undermine his campaign \u2013 all but disappeared. The strategist \u2013 who could not say for certain what exactly Stefanik knew \u2013 told CNN she was likely focused, along with other high-ranking Republicans, on the immediate task of winning a House majority. \u201cIt speaks a little bit to kind of her shift over the past few years, where it\u2019s really kind of become a bit of a zero-sum game,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cWin at all costs, winning is the only thing that matters.\u201d A source close to Stefanik bridled at the criticism of the GOP conference chair, saying, \u201cOne of the many reasons why Congresswoman Stefanik is the highest-ranking Republican in New York State is her operation focuses on winning and doesn\u2019t listen to these gossipy anonymous consultants.\u201d The source also noted that other Republicans had close ties to Santos, arguing that Stefanik was being unfairly scrutinized. \u201cThere are many prominent consultants and staff on the Santos FEC who currently work for senior elected officials and committees, exactly ZERO personnel who work for Congresswoman Stefanik staffed or advised the Santos campaign,\u201d the source told CNN. Another New York Republican operative told CNN that \u201call of us (in GOP campaign circles) screwed up in that we should have vetted him better,\u201d and that Stefanik \u201cprobably got taken in by fact that the seat that had become winnable, he could win.\u201d The operative added that while there were some suspicions about Santos, there was no indication then about the depth of the candidate\u2019s lies, and that most Republican state and local leaders in the state were more focused on higher profile races including former GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin\u2019s contest with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, which he ended up losing by only about six points. Other House races, like that of newly-elected Rep. Mike Lawler, a Rockland Republican who defeated Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the party\u2019s House campaign arm, were also drawing more attention and resources. \u201cStefanik and (House Speaker Kevin) McCarthy should make this ethics process happen faster,\u201d the operative said, and eventually vote to expel Santos. CNN\u2019s Allison Gordon, Yahya Abou-Ghazala and Curt Devine contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The anti-abortion \u201cMarch for Life\u201d for decades demonstrated to Republicans that they could not reach the Oval Office without the support of the anti-abortion movement. On Friday, marchers will gather in Washington with a decades-long mission accomplished, after the Supreme Court\u2019s removal of a constitutional right to an abortion by overturning the Roe v. Wade decision last year. That means this year\u2019s march will be a time for celebration but also of debate about where the movement goes next with some campaigners seeking to restrict the procedure everywhere. But such a refocused goal carries big risks. Democrats after all belatedly leveraged their own energy over abortion in the midterm elections in a backlash against the right-wing Supreme Court majority that helped stave off a big Republican midterm election wave. The March for Life also comes at an extraordinary moment when Donald Trump, the president who did more than any other to end Roe after a pact with social conservative voters that helped win him the 2016 GOP nomination, has launched an extraordinary attack on evangelical leaders he sees as insufficiently loyal, as CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr, Kristen Holmes and Kaitlan Collins reported this week. \u201cNobody has ever done more for Right to Life than Donald Trump. I put three Supreme Court justices, who all voted, and they got something that they\u2019ve been fighting for 64 years, for many, many years,\u201d Trump said in an interview on Real America\u2019s Voice Monday, referring to the overturning of federal abortion rights. \u201cThere\u2019s great disloyalty in the world of politics and that\u2019s a sign of disloyalty,\u201d Trump told conservative journalist David Brody. The comment was a window into Trump\u2019s psychology, revealing his transactional understanding of politics and his highly developed sense of fealty he sees owed to him. The former president is specifically angry over the failure to immediately endorse his 2024 White House bid by some evangelical leaders who remain influential figures in the conservative movement. Trump\u2019s third White House run has so far failed to pick up significant energy. But Trump has also shown signs recently of questioning whether his purported greatest domestic achievement \u2013 the building of a generational conservative Supreme Court majority and its subsequent overturning of Roe \u2013 may end up hindering his hopes of a return to the White House in 2025. He wrote on his Truth Social platform earlier this month that the \u201cabortion issue\u201d had been poorly handled by many Republicans, especially those who insisted on no exceptions in the case or rape, incest or life of the mother, which he said \u201clost large numbers of voters.\u201d The former president\u2019s comments are backed by exit polls from November\u2019s midterms that showed more than a quarter of voters listing abortion as a top issue. About 61% said they were unhappy with the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade, and about 7 in 10 of those voters backed a Democratic House candidate. In his Truth Social comments, Trump appeared to be seeking to offload blame for the Republicans\u2019 failure to win back the Senate and the party\u2019s smaller-than-expected House majority. Trump took on waves of criticism after the election for promoting extreme, election denying candidates who often lost in swing states in the midterm elections. But it is notable seeing Trump navigate the shifting politics of abortion and apparently sizing up how it could affect his political prospects in future. After all, he was once unapologetically pro-choice before his foray into Republican politics dictated a shift in position and led to the bargain with evangelicals, which included an effective commitment to appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court in return for the crucial votes of social conservatives. In the past, Trump has been a fixture of the March for Life rally, and in 2020, he became the first sitting president to attend in person as he geared up for his reelection race. He told marchers that \u201cunborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House.\u201d There is no sign yet that he will call into Friday\u2019s event, which will include a detour to the US Capitol on its usual route to the Supreme Court to underline how Congress is now a focus of the movement, as Democrats seek to codify Roe v. Wade protections into law. Trump\u2019s comments on abortion and his feuding with evangelical leaders raise the question of whether the former president has made a tactical error and is harming his 2024 candidacy by targeting a critical GOP primary voting bloc at a time when there are growing questions over whether he is still the dominant force in Republican politics. Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, told CNN that there is \u201cno path to the nomination without winning the evangelical vote. Nobody knows that better than President Trump because, to the surprise of almost everyone, he won their support in 2016.\u201d This question is especially acute in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucuses \u2013 for Republicans at least \u2013 in the 2024 primary season, which will be the first test of the ex-President\u2019s hold over conservatives and evangelicals especially. Trump didn\u2019t actually win in Iowa in 2016, coming second to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and just beating out Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and the state has often not been a true barometer of how the GOP nominating contest will go. However, it will take on extra significance in 2024 and is likely to be seen as a strong indicator of Trump\u2019s appeal to the conservative base. A loss there would create a painful narrative as he headed into subsequent contests \u2013 especially since he strongly carried the state in the general elections in 2016 and 2020. And it\u2019s easy to come up with a list of potential GOP candidates that might have appeal in the state if they challenge Trump, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, former Vice President Mike Pence or Cruz once again. Only Trump so far is a declared 2024 Republican presidential candidate. Trump would be in an odd situation in 2024, in that he is in many ways effectively an incumbent given his strong support in the GOP and the fact that he didn\u2019t go away after losing reelection. But at the same time, he\u2019s not a sitting president and looks likely to face a contested primary and so may be more exposed in early contests. Still, while some conservative base voters might want to move on, there\u2019s still strong goodwill among many toward Trump, gratitude for the change he brought during his term and admiration for his attitude. \u201cMany people forgave him for his misstatements and his missteps because they generally liked his ability to fight, even if that became a clich\u00e9 for some people, Trump\u2019s detractors,\u201d said Timothy Hagle, an associate professor of political science at the University of Iowa who is an expert on the state\u2019s politics. This gets to point often missed about Trump. For many of his supporters, he offered an emotional as much as a political connection. His willingness to say what many grassroots conservatives thought and to assail institutions they despised, like the media or Washington experts and other elites, were as important as many of his often-ill-defined individual political positions. And it\u2019s also often forgotten that evangelical voters in places like Iowa do not necessarily vote as a bloc, or according to what their leaders or pastors recommend and may prioritize issues such as taxes over social questions if a candidate is deemed to be generally acceptable. That may give Trump more leeway than more conventional candidates in departing from traditional conservative orthodoxy even over abortion. Still, Hagle said, even small numbers of disaffected Iowa voters could make a difference to Trump\u2019s chances in the state if they don\u2019t show up for him, as could more mainstream GOP caucus voters who may be taking a look at other aspects of his candidacy and those of potential rivals. \u201cAre they going to support Trump because he fights, or because of his economic position or his position on the border?\u201d Hagle said. \u201cThe abortion stuff may not be as important to them, or will they go a different direction at this point?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lori Chavez-DeRemer sat in the gallery of the House nearly two decades ago with her mom and her twin daughters \u2013 tourists peering down at lawmakers on the floor of the chamber. \u201cI\u2019d really love to be here someday,\u201d the Oregon Republican recalled telling her mother, who encouraged her to think about a run. She\u2019d recently been elected to her city council, but she had her doubts. \u201cI said, \u2018Everybody on the floor there probably has a law degree. I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom.\u2019\u201d But Chavez-DeRemer flipped a Democratic seat in November, helping Republicans win a narrow House majority. She is now among a record 42 Republican women in Congress and one of the first two Latino members of Congress from Oregon. The trail she has blazed is emblematic of the progress that the Republican Party has made in electing women over the past decade \u2013 hard-fought milestones reached only after outside groups began playing a larger role in primaries. Still, GOP women are far from reaching parity with Democrats. Thirty-three of them will serve in the House alone this term, compared with 91 Democratic women. Though many women (and men who care about electing them) applaud a recent shift in attitude among GOP leadership and a segment of the donor class \u2013 for whom identity politics has often been anathema \u2013 long-term hurdles remain. Some leaders, including House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, want to see the party do more. That push is not just about statistics. It\u2019s imperative as the party tries to appeal to a broader spectrum of voters, including the many suburban women who abandoned the GOP after Donald Trump was elected in 2016. \u201cSuburban women and independent women are going to continue to be the X factor in whether we win,\u201d said Annie Dickerson, the founder and chair of Winning for Women, an outside group that helps elect female Republicans. When Erin Houchin first ran for the Indiana state Senate in 2014, she urged a few party leaders to support female candidates in primaries \u2013 especially in deep-red seats where the primary is the only competitive election. \u201cThe answer I got was, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t get involved in primaries. You should go see if other women will help you,\u2019\u201d Houchin recalled. After winning her race, she ran for Congress in 2016 \u2013 the only woman in a five-person primary for a safe Republican seat. The party officially stayed out; the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s policy is to never take sides in primaries. Houchin had support from Republican women, including early backing from Value in Electing Women, or VIEW, PAC, which encouraged female members of Congress to write checks for her. Those checks, however, were no match for what Houchin was up against: an opponent who benefited from a big-spending super PAC that likely could have outspent her even if she had more institutional party support. Trey Hollingsworth won that primary and the general election and went on to represent the 9th District for three terms before retiring last year. Houchin was once again the only woman in the primary to succeed Hollingsworth out of a field of nine, but this time, she emerged the winner. She easily won the general election for a district that Trump would have carried by 27 points in 2020. \u201cThere were many more groups this time around that did engage,\u201d Houchin said, praising VIEW PAC, Winning for Women and Stefanik\u2019s leadership PAC, known as Elevate PAC or E-PAC. \u201cThat made a difference.\u201d Republicans have long viewed supporting diverse candidates differently from Democrats, who were earlier to embrace building coalitions among specific demographics. \u201cSome of the Republican men didn\u2019t necessarily think that it ought to be a priority,\u201d GOP strategist Parker Poling, the executive director of the NRCC for the 2020 cycle, said of the party\u2019s prior attitude toward boosting female candidates. \u201cI had to sell it very differently in the beginning, back in 2017,\u201d Dickerson recalled. \u201cAnd it was real work persuading donors that it wasn\u2019t identity politics. It was really about identifying excellence.\u201d Stefanik raised the alarm with House GOP leaders after the 2018 election, when, as the first female recruitment chair of the NRCC, she had enlisted more than 100 women to run. Just one of them won. Democrats flipped the House that year, buoyed in large part by the success of female candidates, but the number of GOP women in the chamber declined by nearly half. Even if Republican leaders didn\u2019t immediately recognize the problem \u2013 then-NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer called Stefanik\u2019s desire to get involved in primaries a \u201cmistake\u201d \u2013 they quickly came around in their public support for her mission. \u201cI am very proud that our efforts have been pretty much embraced across the board,\u201d Stefanik said last month when asked if leadership now understands the importance of supporting women. That commitment to changing those dynamics showed in 2020 \u2013 which some have called the \u201cYear of the Republican Woman\u201d \u2013 when a record-breaking number of nonincumbent House GOP female candidates won, helping flip several pivotal Democratic seats. \u201cThere\u2019s an understanding now that Republican women candidates can be very successful in the general election and in many cases are stronger candidates than men,\u201d said Cam Savage, a veteran Republican consultant who worked for Houchin. \u201cIt\u2019s been true for a while; it just hasn\u2019t been recognized.\u201d McDaniel also noted that the tenor of conversations with donors has changed. \u201cOur investors \u2013 when I started, some of them would say to me candidly, \u2018You have young kids. How can you be a mom and do this?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have those conversations anymore. It\u2019s more: \u2018What other women candidates can we invest in?\u2019 \u2018Where can we support women in our party?\u2019\u201d After impressive gains in 2020, Republican women made more nominal progress in 2022. Just one GOP woman, Virginia\u2019s Jen Kiggans, unseated a Democratic incumbent in a swing seat, while several others flipped open seats in Oregon, Florida and Texas. There\u2019s excitement, however, about conservative women\u2019s success in red districts and how that could help deepen and extend the longevity of the bench of female Republicans in Congress. \u201cYou can\u2019t just focus on electing women Republicans in swing seats. That\u2019s why we had, you know, such a historic loss in 2018, as most of our women members were in those swing seats,\u201d Stefanik said. Of the seven nonincumbent Republican women elected last year, five represent districts Trump would have carried in 2020. \u201cThat allows those members to gain seniority over time and also to make investments in other candidates,\u201d added Stefanik. In other words, electing women in safe seats means they\u2019re more likely to stay there \u2013 although not always. Liz Cheney lost her deep-red Wyoming seat in a primary to another woman backed by Stefanik. And those very primaries in deeply conservative districts have sometimes been harder for women to win, even if \u2013 based on their policy positions and voting records \u2013 they are the most conservative candidates. Houchin, for example, said it was important for her to be very clear about where she stood on the issues because \u201cit\u2019s been easier to paint female candidates as more moderate or more liberal. That\u2019s certainly not my profile.\u201d Helping women get through primaries in safe red seats could become more difficult after a deal reached between two outside groups as part of the Republican negotiations over the House speaker\u2019s election. Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC backed by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, agreed to stay out of open-seat primaries in exchange for the anti-tax Club for Growth\u2019s support for his speakership bid. Chavez-DeRemer \u2014 one of those Republican women to flip an open seat last year \u2014 now calls her self-doubts during that visit to the Capitol silly. \u201cLittle did I know that, really, my whole life, I was probably preparing for this,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to just be me.\u201d The former mayor of Happy Valley, in suburban Portland, won a five-way primary in Oregon\u2019s 5th District and went on to win the general election over a Democratic woman, who had defeated the incumbent in her primary. Her story speaks to the message pushed by potential White House aspirant Nikki Haley, who has channeled her energies into elevating female Republican candidates through her Stand for America PAC. \u201cWhat we need to do is to tell women, \u2018We need you. We need you at the table. We need you making the decisions. We need your experience. We need your ability to talk about families and budgets and crime, and all of those things,\u201d the former South Carolina governor and onetime US ambassador to the United Nations said in a brief interview on the campaign trail in Nevada last year. \u201cSuccess begets success,\u201d Poling added of female candidates\u2019 track record. \u201cWhen people see that this helped us win more seats, then they\u2019re more likely to put the time and effort into recruiting and helping female candidates.\u201d Party operatives credit strong recruitment \u2013 both in 2022 under NRCC recruitment chair Carol Miller of West Virginia and in 2020, under then-Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana. \u201cThat begins with the acknowledgment that the way you recruit women is different from men,\u201d Savage said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to recruit men. They line up to tell you they\u2019re the best fit.\u201d But one of the major lessons from 2018 is the recognition that getting women to run isn\u2019t enough: Helping them through the process is also critical. \u201cI don\u2019t look at women as a monolith \u2013 they come with different backgrounds and experience \u2013 but sometimes fundraising can be a challenge, or life balance,\u201d said McDaniel, who was elected RNC chair in 2017. One part of addressing that is female candidates supporting each other. Monica De La Cruz was one of three Republican women running for South Texas swing districts along the southern border last year. \u201cWe had a support group of women who understood exactly what you were going through at that moment, so it was a very special time,\u201d said De La Cruz, the only one of the three to win. And increasingly, there\u2019s recognition that a female perspective can be a strength in the eyes of voters. \u201cI had no political background. I\u2019m a small-business owner, single mom of two teenage children. And people could relate to that,\u201d said De La Cruz, who has been tapped to serve on the RNC\u2019s advisory panel to examine how the party can continue broadening its appeal to women and more diverse voters. \u201cThey saw me at the Friday night football games, and the Saturday morning volleyball games,\u201d she said. \u201cThey saw me in parent-teacher conferences at the school. My community saw themselves in me.\u201d The GOP still has a lot of catching up to do. Even with leadership PACs and outside groups committed to boosting women in Republican primaries, the party lacks the firepower of a group like EMILY\u2019s List, which has been helping elect Democratic women who support abortion rights since the mid-1980s. Some of the outside groups backing GOP women have diverged in primaries, either not engaging in the same races or even backing different women in the same primaries. To expand institutional support, McDaniel pointed to the example of programs such as League of Our Own, a campaign program she worked with in her home state of Michigan that has focused on training female candidates. \u201cWe talked about things like, \u2018How do you raise money? How do you pick a campaign manager?\u2019\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cYou\u2019d see these women who were graduates, going on to be state reps or state senators. It\u2019s really, really impactful to see how even just that little bit of campaign school and that little bit of help can go a long way in bringing women into the conversation.\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said the party must \u201ckeep reaching out\u201d and \u201cmake sure that all women are running at a local level.\u201d Stefanik echoed that sentiment, pointing to a robust state and local pipeline as a lynchpin to deepening the bench of Republican women in Congress in the years ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term strategy,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "It won\u2019t be as \u201ceasy\u201d as President Joe Biden hopes to quell the furor over classified documents unearthed in his post-vice presidential office. Republicans are already making sure of that, belatedly voicing concern over secret material discovered outside the White House \u2013 after energetically dismissing ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s far greater transgressions. The disclosures couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for Biden. Members of the new Republican House majority are falling over one another for a spot on a new committee set up to investigate whether the US government has been politically \u201cweaponized\u201d by Democrats. The mission is rooted in Trump\u2019s false claims that he was spied on by the FBI and that a deep state of liberals is using the instruments of government to persecute him, his family and conservatives. Biden offered his first public reaction to his own classified documents flap during a trip to Mexico in which his bid to show he can handle the southern border crisis was all but drowned out by the controversy. Biden classified documents: What we know so far \u201cLet me get rid of the easy one first,\u201d Biden told an American reporter who asked him several questions, including one about the documents, in Mexico City. He said he was surprised when he learned about the discovery, that he didn\u2019t know what was in the files, that they were in a locked closet and that his lawyers immediately turned them over to the National Archives and Records Administration. \u201cPeople know I take classified documents, classified information seriously,\u201d the president said, drawing an implicit contrast with Trump\u2019s fight to keep many more documents that he hoarded at his Mar-a-Lago resort after leaving office. Biden\u2019s response was notable and his words were carefully chosen, apparently evidence of an acknowledgment by the White House that the president couldn\u2019t ignore the increasing noise over the documents but also of a desire to avoid offering Republicans new political ammunition. According to available evidence so far, Biden appears to be giving it to Americans straight \u2013 as he promised to do on the campaign trail. Yet that does not mean he shouldn\u2019t have to answer questions about how the documents came to be in that Washington, DC, office, whether they were secured and why he didn\u2019t alert the country to the discovery sooner, given the extreme sensitivity of the issue amid special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s criminal investigation into Trump\u2019s retention of classified information. And new revelations or the discovery of other secret material could still change the trajectory of this controversy. Fundamentally, the White House is under pressure to demonstrate that the president has not condemned Trump for careless handling of the nation\u2019s secrets while being haphazard about such material himself. Biden says he was surprised to learn government records, including classified documents, were taken to his private office It\u2019s possible the issue could soon be solved since Justice Department investigators have repeatedly briefed Attorney General Merrick Garland about the episode. But politically, this drama will run and run. Garland, who has vowed to purge Trump-era politicization of the DOJ, is already facing calls for a special counsel \u2013 to demonstrate evenhandedness given the Trump probe. The spectacle of the Justice Department of one administration investigating the immediate former president and an active 2024 White House candidate was already deeply uncomfortable for Garland. The new revelations made it far worse. They also extend a streak of the FBI and the Justice Department being dragged into reputation-tarnishing political swamps \u2013 that date back to Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails during the 2016 presidential campaign when she was the Democratic nominee, and the multiple scandals and examples of political pressure on the department and the bureau involving the Trump administration. Whatever the facts of the Biden documents case, House Republicans have a new opening they can use to spin innuendo and suspicion to damage the president. Nuance, after all, is typically the first casualty of a Washington pseudo-scandal. But all the available evidence so far suggests that Trump\u2019s transgressions are far greater than that of Biden. Trump, for instance, kept hundreds of classified documents \u2013 including some with the highest security designations \u2013 that should, by law, have been handed back to the federal government. This includes more than 100 documents that were seized in a court-approved search of his property by FBI agents last year. At various points, Trump denied he had the material, claimed it was planted by the bureau, insisted that he owned it or ludicrously suggested he had simply declassified it with a private thought. But in a media environment where partisan news coverage blurs the truth, many Americans will only hear headlines about one president \u2013 Biden \u2013 who condemned Trump for keeping secret documents and is now guilty of the same offense. Republicans are certain to brand Biden not just as a hypocrite but will use the case to construct a narrative of absolution for Trump, who is under criminal investigation, including over potential obstruction by the Justice Department. They are already setting up an argument that if Biden is found not to have broken any laws, then it must follow that Trump will be a victim of runaway political persecution if he doesn\u2019t get the same result. The fact that this approach may not reflect the truth of the matter is immaterial from a political perspective \u2013 since the goal of many partisan investigations is to damage the target politically \u2013 even if there\u2019s insufficient evidence to prove that laws were broken or that prosecution is merited. That trend was seen in GOP probes into Clinton ahead of the 2016 election. As an example of the hard-knuckle politics to come, many Republicans who shrugged off Trump\u2019s behavior are suddenly demanding answers from Biden. For example, the incoming chair of the House Oversight Committee, James Comer, told CNN less than two months ago that investigating Trump over his refusal to hand back secret government documents \u201cwill not be a priority\u201d in the new Congress. Yet on Tuesday he fired off a letter to Biden\u2019s White House counsel expressing concern that \u201cPresident Biden has compromised sources and methods with his own mishandling of classified documents.\u201d While there are valid questions that Biden needs to answer, Comer suggested in another letter that the National Archives had shown possible evidence of \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in its handling of the Trump and Biden classified documents cases. Reasoning would suggest the Archives behaved differently toward the current and former president because Biden\u2019s team immediately handed over the documents when they were discovered but Trump resisted handing over his own larger stacks of classified material for months. Biden's classified documents issue adds to House Republicans' growing list of investigations The inconsistencies in the Comer response will only raise suspicions about the political shade of Republican investigations in the 118th Congress. The legislative branch has duty to provide oversight of the White House and there are multiple issues that beg to be investigated \u2014 including the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the border crisis and how the government handled the Covid-19 pandemic, the worst public health emergency in a century. The House, for instance, voted for a bipartisan panel on Tuesday to examine the challenge posed to US national security by China\u2019s increasing military and political power. But the strong impression that many Republicans are leaping at a chance to censure Biden to protect Trump \u2013 a former president who was twice impeached, inspired a mob attack on the US Capitol and tried to steal the 2020 election \u2013 threatens to cast doubt on their motives. Republican House Majority leader Steve Scalise, for instance, on Tuesday obliterated the clear distinction between the cases. \u201c(If) Vice President Biden took classified documents with him and held them for years and criticized former President Trump during that same time that he had those classified documents and only after it was uncovered did he turn them back, I wonder why the press isn\u2019t asking the same questions of him \u2026 that they were asking President Trump,\u201d Scalise told reporters. But Biden was asked questions by journalists about the issue at the first opportunity in Mexico on Tuesday \u2013 and the case is getting more complete explanations in the press than it is from leading Republicans. Yet, Scalise, Comer and other Republicans will certainly ensure that Biden won\u2019t get to stop answering questions on his own classified documents problem any time soon.",

            "article_content": "Republicans seized on revelations that several classified documents from Joe Biden\u2019s time as vice president were found in his former private office to create cover for former President Donald Trump\u2019s hoarding of secret records. The disclosures Monday about the material found last fall spun up an immediate political storm at a time when Trump is in increasing legal peril. The new GOP House majority is meanwhile rushing to undermine investigations against him and unleashing a wave of counter investigations against the current president. But there are clear distinctions between the two cases. The new controversy so far appears to be on a smaller scale than the more than 100 classified documents \u2013 some bearing the highest designations of government secrecy \u2013 taken from Trump\u2019s resort at Mar-a-Lago after a court-approved search by FBI agents. And Biden appears to be cooperating with the National Archives and the Justice Department in a way that Trump failed to do and unlike the former president he is not being investigated for possible obstruction of justice. Bradley Moss, a security clearances expert, told \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Tuesday that so far, and if no more problematic evidence emerges, the current president team\u2019s conduct was different because of \u201cthe cooperation and the absence of obstruction in which they have engaged compared to what Donald Trump did.\u201d \u201cSo far, it\u2019s completely apples to oranges here,\u201d said Moss, who is the deputy executive director of the James Madison Project. But the disclosures spun up an immediate political storm at a time when Trump is in increasing legal peril. The new GOP House majority, meanwhile, is rushing to undermine investigations against him and unleashing a wave of counter investigations against the current president. Trump, who brands attempts to make him face accountability for his conduct in office and afterward as political victimization, sought to capitalize on Biden\u2019s discomfort over the documents in a post on his Truth Social network. \u201cWhen is the FBI going to raid the many homes of Joe Biden, perhaps even the White House? These documents were definitely not declassified,\u201d he wrote. New House Oversight Chairman James Comer told CNN: \u201cThis is (a) further concern that there is a two-tiered justice system.\u201d New House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also moved quickly to respond to the discovery of the documents in an office used by Biden after he left the vice presidency. \u201cOh, really? They just now found them after all these years,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWhat has he said about the other president having classified documents?\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland has asked the US attorney in Chicago to review the material, some of which bore the marking \u201csensitive compartmentalized information\u201d \u2013 showing that it came from intelligence sources. Fairness and respect for the law dictate that Biden should answer many of the same questions that Trump is facing, regarding whether he was entitled to the records, why they were not previously turned over, whether they were securely stored and how they ended up in his office in the first place. Critics will also wonder why Biden didn\u2019t immediately disclose the discovery of less than a dozen documents last fall to the public, given the huge sensitivity of the Justice Department probe of Trump on a similar question. And the president will be sure to face accusations of hypocrisy given his sharp criticisms that Trump did not take the proper steps to secure classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Still, even if there are adequate answers to these issues, any distinctions in the severity of the Biden and Trump documents will be obliterated in the political torrent that is already stirring and with conservative media likely to draw false equivalencies between the two cases. The report offers an immediate opening for Trump as he seeks to dodge culpability for his behavior and claims he\u2019s a victim of persecution to thwart his 2024 campaign. The former president is a master at turning one incident into an entire campaign narrative \u2013 as he did with former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in 2016. And the report will give the new Republican House majority fresh material as it unleashes a multi-front investigative assault against the White House. And while there so far appear to be clear differences in the magnitude of the cases, the report \u2013 first carried by CBS \u2013 about Biden will inevitably raise political pressure on Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s retention of classified material. Smith is also now reaching even deeper into the ex-president\u2019s inner circle by subpoenaing his former lawyer Rudy Giuliani as part of a federal grand jury probe looking at Trump\u2019s fundraising, among other issues related to the 2020 election. The Biden document disclosures will also deepen the already intense political headache facing Garland as he contemplates an eventual decision on whether to charge Trump, whose status as an ex-president and an active 2024 candidate carries huge political implications. Garland insists that investigations will go where the evidence and the law demands as he seeks to stress the independence of the Justice Department \u2014 which was perpetually in question when Trump was president. But now, inevitably and however the Biden vice presidential documents issue is resolved, a decision to charge Trump over the classified documents case but not to take the same action against Biden would incite political uproar among conservatives who would be sure to allege double standards. The former president\u2019s legal team issued a temperate response to the Biden report that sought to broaden openings that could shield their client. One lawyer said that the Biden story was \u201cindicative of a larger problem with trying to keep track of classified information in the offices of the President and the VP. There is an over classification problem, and at the end of an Administration, things get packed up and moved and it\u2019s hard to keep track.\u201d The lawyer also warned that if Trump were to be charged, his representatives would demand all communications between the National Archives and Biden\u2019s team on the matter. Biden\u2019s attorneys found the documents in a locked closet in a private office in Washington the future president used as a visiting professor with the University of Pennsylvania. The White House Counsel\u2019s office notified the National Archives and officials at the agency took control of the documents the morning after they were found. Biden wasn\u2019t aware the documents were in the office until his personal lawyers reported their existence and remains in the dark of the content of the material, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Federal office holders are required by law to relinquish official documents and classified documents when their government service ends. Unlike in Trump\u2019s case, Biden doesn\u2019t appear to have tried to assert ownership of the files, to obstruct their handover or make outlandish claims that he had previously declassified them based on an undisclosed private thought. Trump is being investigated by Smith to see whether he infringed the Espionage Act by keeping classified material and for the possible obstruction of justice. The Biden documents case will intensify the showdown already emerging between the new Republican House majority and the White House. For two years, Trump has been rocked by blow-after-blow from congressional and criminal probes over his conduct during and after his presidency that have nudged him ever closer to accountability. But help is on the way. The new Republican majority in the House is ready to unleash a vast investigative machine apparently designed to discredit and distract from Trump\u2019s alleged transgressions and to wound Biden\u2019s nascent reelection race. Such an offensive was always coming, given the extent to which the deeply conservative House GOP remains in thrall to the ex-president. But the intensity, scope and financial muscle of the investigations was bolstered by the concessions offered by McCarthy as he caved to right-wing hardliners in order to win his speakership last week. And it represents a fast-expanding challenge for the White House, which has already spent months preparing its defense. A new House rules package passed on Monday for instance will set up probes into alleged political bias in agencies like the FBI and the Justice Department and what Republicans see as political weaponization of such agencies. The move cements the GOP\u2019s sharp turn away from the FBI, once seen as one of the most conservative agencies in the US government following Trump\u2019s repeated claims he was illegally targeted by investigations and his failure to enlist the bureau as a weapon to advance his political grievances. Rigorous scrutiny and oversight are inevitable and desirable as part of the constitutional duty of Congress and responsibility to ensure accountability with taxpayer money. And in the first two years of the Biden administration, there are multiple questions that merit further investigation and over which the public deserves more clarity. This includes the chaotic management of the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the way that Covid-19 mitigation funds were spent or the administration\u2019s unwillingness at least until recently to consider the rising numbers of migrants crossing the southern border as a crisis. Proper oversight can avoid the repeat of errors and inform better policy in future. But as always in Congress, there are questions over when genuine oversight stops and hyper-partisan politically motivated witch hunts begin, especially in the case of key Republicans who have a long record of crossing over the line. Incoming House Judiciary Chairman Rep Jim Jordan, for instance, was a leading player in a previous investigation by a GOP House into the death of US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans who were killed by Islamic militants in Benghazi in 2012. The two-year GOP-run House probe found a perfect storm of bureaucratic inertia, rapidly worsening security in Libya and inadequate resources led up to the killings. But Jordan was not satisfied when the final report did not bear out conservative attacks on the conduct of Hillary Clinton \u2014 who was Secretary of State at the time of the deaths. The Ohio lawmaker released his own far more critical report, along with then Rep. Mike Pompeo, who later became Secretary of State himself. And at the time, McCarthy boasted that the investigation harmed Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, apparently revealing partisan motivations behind the probe. As well as the building storm over classified documents, a key focus of the new GOP House majority will be to investigate the House Select Committee in the previous Democratic-run House that painted a damning picture of Trump\u2019s behavior following the 2020 election and before the Capitol insurrection. The fact that many of the current members of the House voted to deny certification of Biden\u2019s election victory based on lies about electoral fraud Trump was using to try to steal power underscores why many observers are raising new questions about the partisan nature of Republican investigations. But after the revelations about documents found in Biden\u2019s office, Republicans know a political gift when they see it.

            "article_content": "Kevin McCarthy faces the first test of his capacity to cling onto power on Monday after he effectively gutted the House speakership of much of its authority so he could secure his dream job. McCarthy finally won the gavel on the 15th ballot early Saturday morning amid chaotic scenes after pleading with holdouts to relent and caving to the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus with repeated concessions. Now, the new speaker must manage his conference in his first order of business: Attempting to pass a package of House rules that is effectively a ransom on power required by his party\u2019s most extreme elements. The risk for McCarthy is not just that he undermined his own tenure by agreeing to one particular rule change that means a single member can call for a vote to topple him at any time. It is that he has empowered extremists who could alienate mainstream America and in 2024 endanger the tiny new GOP majority that was built on flipping formerly Democratic seats in states like New York and California. The ideological extremism of the new House was encapsulated by the fact that on the second anniversary of the Capitol insurrection, McCarthy needed the help of former President Donald Trump, who incited the worst attack on democracy in modern times, to get over the line in the cliffhanger final ballot. In a chilling reminder of that day of infamy, Brazil suffered its own version of January 6 on Sunday as a mob loyal to defeated former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed government buildings. Like Trump, Bolsonaro lost reelection after raising unsubstantiated doubts about the fairness of the vote. But after last week\u2019s farcical events in the US, which saw McCarthy constantly outwitted or betrayed by rebel lawmakers and a fight almost break out on the House floor, the triumphant radical wing of the House GOP is making no apologies. \u201cWe need a little of this sort of breaking the glass in order to get us to the table, in order for us to fight for the American people,\u201d Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a leading conservative who extracted concessions from McCarthy in return for the votes of a bloc of lawmakers, told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cAre we going to have this kind of conflict going forward? I hope so,\u201d he added. But on the same show, Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw \u2013 while agreeing with much of the new rules package the House will consider this week \u2013 condemned how rebels \u201cdegraded and diminished and insulted\u201d McCarthy. Many observers believe the process raises questions about McCarthy\u2019s ability to enact the complex legislation of critical national importance that lays ahead. McCarthy\u2019s problems will not just come from extremists. One more moderate Republican, Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, revealed the teetering foundation on which McCarthy\u2019s speakership stands when he said Sunday that he would oppose the rules package. The GOP\u2019s failure to whip up a dominant red wave victory in the midterms means its leaders can afford to lose only four votes on any measure. Thus, McCarthy\u2019s capacity to govern will always be in doubt. \u201cAt the end of the day, you can\u2019t let \u2026 the insurgency caucus take hold and dictate,\u201d Gonzales said on CBS \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d He described McCarthy as a great leader and said he would not whip his colleagues to join his stand. But he said he could not support the rules package because he said it would result in a multi-billion dollar cut in defense spending. In a sign of the wider political implications of last week\u2019s fiasco and the rise of the right, one Republican member, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who repeatedly noted she represents a swing \u201cpurple\u201d district, raised concerns over whether the rules package contained secret deals to appease right-wingers. \u201cSo, my question really is today is, what backroom deals were cut?\u201d Mace said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have any idea what promises were made or what gentleman\u2019s handshakes were made.\u201d Mace\u2019s point raised the question of whether the majority of the House Republican conference that repeatedly lined up behind McCarthy will make an attempt to assert and restore its power or be constantly browbeaten by the Freedom Caucus and be forced to follow a speaker who has neutered much of his own influence. The most optimistic interpretation of last week\u2019s chaos is that after working through its divisions in the kind of fractious speaker\u2019s race not seen since before the Civil War, the new Republican House has purged its acrimony. McCarthy made such a point last week \u2013 though sparked derision given that the new House majority couldn\u2019t even fulfill its first and simplest function: Electing a speaker to lead it. \u201cSee, this is the great part. Because it took this long, now we learned how to govern. So now we\u2019ll be able to get the job done,\u201d McCarthy said. Still, while concessions the new speaker handed over to win his job will empower his right wing, there are elements in the rules package that both sides of the House could welcome and could restore power taken from individual lawmakers by successive leaders of both parties. It for instance restores a 72-hour notice period between the publication of a bill and a final vote. And it could allow individual members more latitude to make amendments to appropriations bills. Restoring the primacy of committees and individual spending bills and debates would also be keeping in with how the House was run for generations, before party leaders tried to subvert partisan dysfunction by cramming discretionary government spending into massive end-of-year omnibus bills like the $1.7 trillion version that passed Congress in the final days of Democratic control last year. Many Republican voters are deeply concerned with the level of government spending, especially during the Biden administration, and the party based its recapture of the House majority \u2013 no matter how thin it is \u2013 partly on that platform. But the idea that McCarthy, who repeatedly miscalculated the size of his own support and botched vote counts in balloting for speaker, could manage a complex congressional dance needed to fund the government is so far belied by events. And the fact that the new House is likely to be one of the most right-wing in history, with a strong anti-democratic streak, is likely to undermine efforts to make it function better. McCarthy agreed, for instance, that Republicans will have a vast budget to investigate the supposed political weaponization of justice and intelligence agencies like the FBI and the CIA. In practice, the initiative, under the jurisdiction of expected incoming Judiciary Committee Chairman and Trump ally, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, is likely to be used to undermine criminal investigations of the former president over his role on January 6 and his hoarding of classified documents. The new House will be well within its rights to mount aggressive oversight of the Biden administration on issues like the Afghanistan withdrawal, China policy and the crisis at the southern border that has often been downplayed by the president \u2013 despite his visit there Sunday. But there are already signs that some of its probes will further a hardline anti-democratic agenda and are designed to flesh out conservative media talking points. This is especially true for instance, regarding the origins of Covid-19 and the role of the government\u2019s former top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. In addition, many of the members of the new House majority voted not to certify President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory over baseless claims of electoral fraud only hours after the January 6 insurrection. The most profound test for McCarthy could come later this year with the White House over raising the government\u2019s capacity to borrow more money to finance spending to which Congress is already committed. If the debt ceiling isn\u2019t raised, the US could default on its obligations, unleashing a major financial crisis. But conservatives have said they will demand massive spending cuts to agree to free-up borrowing, in a way that will hold the economy hostage. If McCarthy, caught between his own right-wing and the need to avoid a major crisis with global reverberations, will not cave to his party\u2019s right wing, he could find himself thrown out of a job. As with the speaker\u2019s race, McCarthy will apparently be boxed in by fiscal conservatives who are willing to accept government shutdowns and crises to disrupt the idea of governance itself, or by pro-Trump exhibitionists who are willing to shatter the majority for a moment in the political spotlight. While the GOP came by its new House majority in a free and fair election, the pro-Trump cast of the conference will not only raise alarm bells for democracy \u2013 but also for McCarthy\u2019s capacity to keep or expand the party\u2019s control in 2024. And greater representation for Freedom Caucus lawmakers on key committees that dictate the business of the House will ensure a far more partisan and conservative agenda \u2013 another factor that could alienate more moderate voters. The story of the 118th Congress will almost be over McCarthy\u2019s constant fights to control his own coalition. The spending showdowns when the GOP controlled the House for parts of the Obama administration might pale in comparison to future standoffs. Ohio\u2019s John Boehner \u2013 one of two Republican speakers, along with Paul Ryan, effectively driven out of their jobs by the rise of the far-right \u2013 wrote in his autobiography in 2021 that because of House extremists in his own caucus, aided by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, there were times when \u201cunder the new rules of Crazytown, I may have been speaker, but I didn\u2019t hold all the power.\u201d McCarthy already faces the same fate. But the accommodations he made just to get the job suggest he made have already have made peace with it.",

            "article_content": "Kevin McCarthy was elected House speaker in the early hours of Saturday morning \u2013 a major victory for the California Republican that elevates him to a powerful position leading the GOP majority in the chamber and an outcome that followed days of painstaking negotiations and failed votes. To secure the gavel, McCarthy had to chip away at opposition from a bloc of hardline conservatives in what became the longest contest in 164 years. To win over critics, McCarthy and his allies made a series of concessions to conservatives \u2013 a move that frustrated moderates concerned the concessions may make it harder for the new GOP majority to effectively govern. As Republicans turn their attention to implementing their agenda, the struggle McCarthy faced to lock down votes may serve as a preview of the kind of challenges he will face in trying to unite his members in the future. The deal-making McCarthy engaged in also appears poised to leave him with a weaker hand to play in his new position of authority, though the California Republican has disputed that notion. The speaker election unfolded over a series of days \u2013 beginning on the first day of the 118th Congress \u2013 and highlighted divides between conservatives and moderates. The final hours before McCarthy was elected were punctuated with chaotic and tense moments on the House floor with lawmakers on the edge of their seats waiting to see how a handful of remaining holdouts would vote. A number of top Republicans expressed confidence that McCarthy could win in the 14th round of voting, but ultimately he fell just short. That outcome threw the House into disarray and prompted Republicans to move to adjourn. At the last moment, however, Republicans switched their votes to be able to instead move to a 15th ballot \u2013 and in that round of voting, McCarthy finally won. In a major shift, McCarthy and his allies successfully flipped more than a dozen GOP votes into his column Friday afternoon \u2013 the first sign of serious momentum in support of his speaker bid after a series of failed votes over the course of multiple days. Here is a list of key concessions and promises McCarthy and his allies have made over the course of the negotiations, based on CNN reporting: The 14 votes who flipped in favor of McCarthy on the 12th ballot are: Reps. Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Michael Cloud of Texas, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Byron Donalds of Florida, Mary Miller of Illinois, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Chip Roy of Texas, Victoria Spartz of Indiana (who had been voting present and had said she would continue to do so until she saw progress), Paul Gosar of Arizona and Reps.-elect Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Anna Paulina Luna of Florida,  Keith Self of Texas and Andy Ogles of Tennessee. On the 13th ballot, McCarthy picked up one more supporter: Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland. On the 12th round of voting, the final tally was 213 for McCarthy, four for Rep. Jim Jordan and three for Rep. Kevin Hern. In the 13th round, McCarthy had 214 votes and Jordan had six. The final tally in the 14th round was 216 for McCarthy, two for Biggs, two for Jordan and two voting present. On the 15th and final round of voting, the tally was was 216 for McCarthy and six voting present. Part of the strategy to secure McCarthy the speakership was to get some of the holdouts to vote \u201cpresent,\u201d according to several sources. That was a way to reduce the threshold for winning the speaker race below 218 since the rules say the winner of the race needs to have a majority of those voting for a specific candidate. Another plan from McCarthy\u2019s allies had been to pick the remaining holdouts off one-by-one to get the speaker votes. That strategy, according to sources involved, included leaning on former President Donald Trump to help squeeze the holdouts. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

            "article_content": "The House has adjourned for the third day without electing a new speaker after Kevin McCarthy continued to suffer a string of defeats in multiple rounds of voting on Thursday. As the fight for the gavel drags on, it has now become the longest speaker contest in 164 years. Each failed vote only increases pressure on McCarthy to end the impasse, but it is unclear whether he will be able to pull it off as the situation grows increasingly dire for his future political prospects. Even after proposing major concessions to his hardline conservative opponents late Wednesday, the California Republican has still not yet been able to lock in the 218 votes he needs to win the gavel. The longer the fight drags out, the more dire it becomes for McCarthy\u2019s future, as it risks further defections and a loss of confidence in the GOP leader. McCarthy said after the House\u2019s adjournment Thursday that progress had been made in negotiations but he would not put a \u201ctimeline\u201d on when he could get to 218 votes. \u201cSo if this takes a little longer and it doesn\u2019t meet your deadline, that\u2019s OK,\u201d he told reporters. McCarthy also addressed criticisms that differences among the caucus weren\u2019t resolved before the contest for speaker began this week, saying they \u201ctried to sort it out\u201d before January 3. Talks have continued among Republicans as the GOP majority hopes to find a path forward. Negotiators between the McCarthy allies and opponents are pushing for a deal Thursday night in attempt to show progress, according to a source in talks. They believe they have made significant progress, but they are still haggling over some of the details. Complicating matters is the fact that at least four Republican members are leaving town Friday because of various family issues. An agreement is close with Rep. Chip Roy of Texas and McCarthy\u2019s team, led by Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, according to multiple sources. If they can get an agreement, they would be able to get the votes to adjourn the chamber for the night. But that still wouldn\u2019t get McCarthy to 218 votes \u2013 the threshold he needs to hit \u2013 since there are other members who have concerns that haven\u2019t been addressed. Patience is wearing thin among lawmakers and moderates have also grown increasingly frustrated over the concessions, which many believe may make it harder for the new GOP majority to effectively govern, though they will likely still swallow them. McCarthy was defiant on Thursday in the face of the stiff headwinds, saying that he will continue to face opposition until he reaches a deal with his detractors. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be this way until an agreement comes,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s easier if we\u2019re able to all get an agreement together.\u201d Asked by CNN the point he would make a realization that the outcome won\u2019t change, McCarthy said: \u201cAfter I win.\u201d What do these hardliners want? Here's what they've said In a series of new concessions first reported by CNN Wednesday night, McCarthy agreed to propose a rules change that would allow just one member to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker, according to two sources familiar with the matter. McCarthy had initially proposed a five-member threshold, down from current conference rules that require half of the GOP to call for such a vote.   He told reporters after the House adjourned Thursday that he\u2019s not concerned about giving just one member the power to call for a vote to oust the speaker, saying he was \u201cvery fine with that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. \u2026 I won\u2019t be a weaker speaker,\u201d he said. McCarthy also agreed to allow for more members of the Freedom Caucus to serve on the powerful House Rules Committee, which dictates how and whether bills come to the floor, and to vote on a handful of bills that are priorities for the holdouts, including proposing term limits on members and a border security plan. Republican sources say that even if McCarthy\u2019s offers are accepted, it would still not get him the 218 votes he needs to be speaker. While these concessions could attract some new support, other opponents have raised different concerns that have yet to be fully addressed. McCarthy has already made a number of concessions to his opponents, though so far his efforts have not been enough. But sources said the talks Wednesday between McCarthy allies and holdouts have been the most productive and serious ones to date. And in one sign of a breakthrough, a McCarthy-aligned super PAC agreed to not play in open Republican primaries in safe seats \u2013 one of the big demands that conservatives had asked for but that McCarthy had resisted until this point. What happens in the House when there is no speaker? One moderate Republican told CNN Thursday morning that they aren\u2019t happy about the concessions, though they are willing to have \u201cdiscussions\u201d about them. The fear is that lowering the threshold for a vote to oust the speaker to one member will make governing on items like the debt limit and funding almost impossible. \u201cI don\u2019t like the rules but am willing to hear discussions. I think they\u2019re a mistake for the conference. These handful of folks want a weak speaker with a four-vote majority. The public will not like what they see of the GOP, I fear,\u201d the member said. The fight over the speakership, which began Tuesday on the first day of the 118th Congress, has thrown the new House GOP majority into chaos and undercut the party\u2019s agenda. McCarthy has so far come up short in multiple rounds of voting. The final GOP tally for the sixth vote, which took place on Wednesday, was 201 for McCarthy, 20 for Florida Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and one \u201cpresent\u201d vote. In the seventh ballot, McCarthy still had 20 total GOP lawmakers voting against him, except this time GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz voted for former President Donald Trump, while the other 19 voted for Donalds. GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz voted present again. The final tally was 201 for McCarthy, 19 for Donalds, one for Trump and one present vote. The final tally for the eighth ballot was 201 for McCarthy, 17 for Donalds, two for GOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, one for Trump and one present vote. The final tally for the ninth ballot was 200 for McCarthy, 17 for Donalds, 3 for Hern, and 1 present vote. Buck, who has supported McCarthy, did not vote that round. In the tenth vote, McCarthy still had 20 total GOP lawmakers voting against him. The final tally was 200 for McCarthy, 13 for Donalds, seven for Hern and one present vote. On the eleventh ballot, there were 200 for McCarthy, 12 for Donalds, seven for Hern, one for Trump and one present vote. The House will remain paralyzed until this standoff is resolved. This is the first time an election for speaker has gone to multiple ballots since 1923. To be elected speaker, a candidate needs to win a majority of members who vote for a specific person on the House floor. That amounts to 218 votes if no member skips the vote or votes \u201cpresent.\u201d House Republicans won 222 seats in the new Congress, so for McCarthy to reach 218, he can only afford to lose four GOP votes.

            "article_content": "After suffering yet another stinging defeat on Wednesday, in which he lost a sixth round of voting for House speaker, Kevin McCarthy proposed more key concessions in his push to get 218 votes  \u2013 including agreeing to propose a rules change that would allow just one member to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The major concession comes as McCarthy is struggling to find a path forward with the House adjourned until 12 p.m. ET on Thursday. The House GOP majority has been stuck at a contentious stalemate amid opposition to McCarthy from a group of conservatives. The fight, which began on the first day of the 118th Congress, has thrown the new House GOP majority into chaos and undercut the party\u2019s agenda. The House will continue to be paralyzed until this standoff is resolved. The situation has grown dire for McCarthy\u2019s political future as Republican allies are beginning to fear that the House GOP leader may not be able to pull off his gamble for speaker if the fight goes much longer. It\u2019s not at all clear whether McCarthy and his allies will be able to lock down the votes \u2013 and the longer the fight drags on, the more imperiled his speakership bid has become. But there were signs Wednesday that negotiations are progressing. McCarthy\u2019s latest concession would be a significant win for hardline conservatives \u2013 after the California Republican had already proposed a five-member threshold,  down from current conference rules that require half of the GOP to call for such a vote. But many more moderate members had been concerned about giving in to the far-right on this matter since it could weaken the speakership and cause chaos in the ranks. In two more concessions, the sources said, he\u2019s also agreed to allow for more members of the Freedom Caucus to serve on the powerful House Rules Committee, which dictates how and whether bills come to the floor, and to vote on a handful of bills that are priorities for the holdouts, including proposing term limits on members and a border security plan. Nothing is final, however, since the negotiations are ongoing. And Republican sources say that even if McCarthy\u2019s offer is accepted, it would still not get him the 218 votes he needs to be speaker. While these concessions could attract some new support, other opponents have raised different concerns that have yet to be fully addressed.   After a series of failed speaker votes earlier in the day, the House adjourned for several hours as Republicans continued talks. Texas Rep. Chip Roy, one of the conservatives who has voted against McCarthy\u2019s speakership bid, told GOP leaders that he thinks he can get 10 holdouts to come along if these ongoing negotiations pan out, according to GOP sources familiar with the internal discussions, and that there are additional detractors who may be willing to vote \u201cpresent.\u201d Sources said the talks Wednesday between McCarthy allies and holdouts have been the most productive and serious ones to date. And in one sign of a breakthrough, a McCarthy-aligned super PAC agreed to not play in open Republican primaries in safe seats \u2013 one of the big demands that conservatives had asked for but that McCarthy had resisted until this point. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more discussions in the last two days as a body sitting there, than we\u2019ve done in frickin\u2019 four years,\u201d Roy said when leaving the Capitol Wednesday night. Still, even if these negotiations prove successful and 10 lawmakers do flip to McCarthy\u2019s column \u2013 which is far from certain \u2013 that doesn\u2019t get McCarthy to the 218 votes to win the speakership, so he would still have more work to do. Incoming House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said Wednesday evening that the negotiations over the next speaker have been \u201cvery, very constructive.\u201d \u201cThere were a whole bunch of members that were involved in this and there are some folks now that are sitting down and talking about that discussion to see where they want to go with it next,\u201d the Minnesota Republican said. House Republicans hold 222 seats in the new Congress, so for McCarthy to reach 218, he can only afford to lose four GOP votes. His obstacle is that he faces a small but determined contingent of hardline conservatives who have so far been successful in denying him the votes to secure the gavel. The group has used the leverage they have in the razor-thin Republican majority to extract concessions. McCarthy has already given in to a number of their demands, including making it increasingly easier to topple the sitting speaker, but so far his efforts have not been enough. The House convened on Wednesday to continue voting after three rounds of votes on Tuesday. McCarthy has come up short each time, failing to hit the majority threshold needed to secure the speakership. As the votes stretched on Tuesday, the situation appeared to become even more dire for McCarthy, as the vote count in opposition to his speaker bid grew. What happens in the House when there is no speaker? Not a lot The tally for the first ballot in the speaker vote was 203 for McCarthy, with 19 Republicans voting for other candidates. The tally for the second ballot was 203 votes for McCarthy with 19 votes for GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. In the third round of voting, there were 202 votes for McCarthy and 20 votes for Jordan, with Rep. Byron Donalds joining the 19 GOP lawmakers who had voted against McCarthy in the first two rounds. It was the first time an election for speaker went to multiple ballots since 1923. \u201cMy vote yesterday was basically to break a deadlock, because we were deadlocked, and we were not getting anywhere,\u201d Donalds, a Florida Republican, said Wednesday on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d \u201cRight now, (McCarthy) doesn\u2019t have a pathway to get there. If that reemerges, yeah, I can be there, that\u2019s fine, but what\u2019s necessary now is that Republicans come together and find a way to elect a speaker.\u201d In the fourth round of voting, 20 Republicans voting together for Donalds as the group switched their collective support from Jordan to Donalds. Rep. Victoria Spartz of Indiana voted present, lowering McCarthy\u2019s threshold to 217. Spartz told CNN she did so because she wanted to allow for more negotiations within the conference to address the concerns of the 20 members. The final tally for the fifth vote was again 201 votes for McCarthy, 20 for Donalds and one present vote. The final tally for the sixth vote was the same: 201 for McCarthy, 20 for Donalds and one present vote. McCarthy may have only himself to blame Trump is watching closely as the dynamic plays out on Capitol Hill and his public support has been a key focus of McCarthy\u2019s efforts. Two GOP sources familiar with the matter said McCarthy\u2019s allies were panicking on Tuesday after the former president gave a tepid response to NBC News when asked about his support for McCarthy. The former president also declined to issue a statement Monday reiterating his endorsement of McCarthy despite a behind-the-scenes effort from several McCarthy allies to get Trump to do so, two sources said. One close McCarthy ally then began working behind the scenes to do clean-up duty and started pressing for Trump to put out a statement clarifying his support. McCarthy and Trump then connected by phone, where McCarthy said Trump expressed he was still committed to backing him. Trump put out a strong endorsement on Truth Social Wednesday morning, imploring Republicans not to \u201cTURN A GREAT TRIUMPH INTO A GIANT & EMBARRASSING DEFEAT\u201d and urging them to vote for McCarthy. Although Trump\u2019s statement might not move the needle among the fiercest McCarthy foes, one of the sources said McCarthy world was worried about looking \u201cweak\u201d and like he was bleeding support, so they felt it was important to reverse the narrative. Gaetz, one of the House Republicans opposing McCarthy\u2019s bid for speaker, dismissed Trump\u2019s latest effort to help the California Republican as \u201csad.\u201d \u201cThis changes neither my view of McCarthy nor Trump nor my vote,\u201d Gaetz said in a statement to Fox News Digital on Wednesday, shortly after Trump came to McCarthy\u2019s defense in the Truth Social post. Long a staunch Trump ally, Gaetz\u2019s refusal to bow to Trump\u2019s desire for a McCarthy speakership raises new questions about the former president\u2019s dwindling influence over Republicans in the midst of his third presidential campaign. \u201cIf Matt Gaetz is ignoring you, that\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d said one Trump ally who is involved with his 2024 campaign. Trump has been making calls on McCarthy\u2019s behalf over the last 24 hours in an attempt to break the conservative blockade against him, this person said, but his efforts have so far been fruitless. One lawmaker who spoke with Trump late Tuesday suggested the former president should run for speaker himself, according to a person briefed on the call. Trump demurred and continued to push this person to support McCarthy, claiming that he would be a solid \u201cAmerica First\u201d supporter.

            "article_content": "Republicans\u2019 take over of the House this week will usher in a two-year political era that threatens to bring governing showdowns and shutdowns as a GOP speaker and Democratic president try to wield power from opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. The unprecedented possibility that former President Donald Trump, who\u2019s already launched another bid for the White House, could face indictment could tear the nation further apart at a moment when American democracy remains under grave strain. The already stirring 2024 presidential campaign, meanwhile, will stir more political toxins as both parties sense the White House and control of Congress are up for grabs after the closely fought midterms. Abroad, the war in Ukraine brings the constant, alarming possibility of spillover into a NATO-Russia conflict and will test the willingness of American taxpayers to keep sending billions of dollars to sustain foreigners\u2019 dreams of freedom. As he leads the West in this crisis, President Joe Biden faces ever more overt challenges from rising superpower China and alarming advances in the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea. If 2022 was a tumultuous and dangerous year, 2023 could be just as fraught. Washington is bracing for a sharp shock. Since November, the big story has been about the red wave that didn\u2019t arrive. But the reality of divided government will finally dawn this week. A House Republican majority, in which radical conservatives now have disproportionate influence, will take over one half of Capitol Hill. Republicans will fling investigations, obstruction and possible impeachments at the White House, designed to throttle Biden\u2019s presidency and ruin his reelection hopes. Ironically, voters who disdained Trump-style circus politics and election denialism will get more of it since the smaller-than-expected GOP majority means acolytes of the ex-president, like expected House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, will have significant sway. The new Republican-run House represents, in effect, a return to power of Trumpism in a powerful corner of Washington. If House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy wins his desperate struggle against his party\u2019s hardliners to secure the speakership, he\u2019ll be at constant risk of walking the plank after making multiple concessions to extreme right-wingers. McCarthy commits to key concession in call with frustrated lawmakers but it's no guarantee he'll win speakership A weak speaker and a nihilistic pro-Trump faction in the wider GOP threaten to produce a series of spending showdowns with the White House \u2013 most dangerously over the need to raise the government\u2019s borrowing authority by the middle of the year, which could throw the US into default if it\u2019s not done. As Democrats head into the minority under a new generation of leaders, government shutdowns are more likely than bipartisanship. The GOP is vowing to investigate the business ties of the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and the crisis at the southern border. The GOP could suffer, however, if voters think they overreached \u2013 a factor Biden will use as he eyes a second term. In the Senate, Democrats are still celebrating the expansion of their tiny majority in the midterms. (After two years split at 50-50, the chamber is now 51-49 in their favor). Wasting no time in seeking to carve out a reputation among voters as a force for bipartisanship and effective governance, the president will travel to Kentucky this week. He\u2019ll take part in an event also featuring Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to highlight the infrastructure package that passed with bipartisan support in 2021. Attorney General Merrick Garland could shortly face one of the most fateful decisions in modern politics: whether to indict Trump over his attempt to steal the 2020 election and over his hoarding of classified documents. A criminal prosecution of an ex-president and current presidential candidate by the administration that succeeded him would subject the country\u2019s political and judicial institutions to more extreme strain than even Trump has yet managed. The ex-president has already claimed persecution over investigations he faces \u2013 and an early declaration of his 2024 campaign has given him the chance to frame them as politicized. If Trump were indicted, the uproar could be so corrosive that it\u2019s fair to ask whether such an action would be truly in the national interest \u2013 assuming special counsel Jack Smith assembles a case that would have a reasonable chance of success in court. Bash asks Kinzinger if Trump will be charged for Jan. 6. Hear his response Yet if Trump did indeed break the law \u2013 and given the strength of the evidence of insurrection against him presented in the House January 6 committee\u2019s criminal referrals \u2013 his case also creates an even more profound dilemma. A failure to prosecute him would set a precedent that puts ex-presidents above the law. \u201cIf a president can incite an insurrection and not be held accountable, then really there\u2019s no limit to what a president can do or can\u2019t do,\u201d outgoing Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a member of the select committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cIf he\u2019s not guilty of a crime, then I, frankly, fear for the future of his country because now every future president can say, \u2018Hey, here\u2019s the bar.\u2019 And the bar is, do everything you can to stay in power.\u201d Like it or not, with his November announcement, Trump has pitched America into the next presidential campaign. But unusual doubts cloud his future after seven years dominating the Republican Party. His limp campaign launch, bleating over his 2020 election loss and the poor track record of his hand-picked election-denying candidates in the midterms have dented Trump\u2019s aura. Potential alternative figureheads for his populist, nationalist culture war politics, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are emerging who could test the ex-president\u2019s bond with his adoring conservative base. Even as he fends off multiple investigations, Trump must urgently show he\u2019s still the GOP top dog as more and more Republicans consider him a national liability. Biden is edging closer to giving Americans a new piece of history \u2013 a reelection campaign from a president who is over 80. His success in staving off a Republican landslide in the midterms has quelled some anxiety among Democrats about a possible reelection run. And Biden\u2019s strongest card is that he\u2019s already beaten Trump once. Still, he wouldn\u2019t be able to play that card if Trump fades and another potential GOP nominee emerges. DeSantis, for example, is roughly half the current president\u2019s age. As 2023 opens, a repeat White House duel between Trump and Biden \u2013 which polls show voters do not want \u2013 is the best bet. But shifting politics, the momentous events in the months to come and the vagaries of fate means there\u2019s no guarantee this will be the case come the end of the year. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year showed how outside, global events can redefine a presidency. Biden\u2019s leadership of the West against Moscow\u2019s unprovoked aggression will be an impressive centerpiece of his legacy. But Russian President Vladimir Putin shows every sign of fighting on for years. Ukraine says it won\u2019t stop until all his forces are driven out. So Biden\u2019s capacity to stop the war from spilling over into a disastrous Russia-NATO clash will be constantly tested. And who knows how long US and European voters will stomach high energy prices and sending billions of taxpayer cash to arm Ukraine if Western economies dip into recession this year. Biden has his hands full elsewhere. An alarming airborne near miss between a Chinese jet and US military jet over the South China Sea over the holiday hints at how tensions in the region, especially over Taiwan, could trigger another superpower standoff. Biden also faces burgeoning nuclear crises with Iran and North Korea, which, along with Russia\u2019s nuclear saber rattling, suggests the beginning of a dangerous new era of global conflict and risk. Rarely has an economy been so hard to judge. In 2022, 40-year-high inflation and tumbling stock markets coincided with historically low unemployment rates, which created an odd simultaneous sensation of economic anxiety and wellbeing. The key question for 2023 will be whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s harsh interest rate medicine \u2013 designed to bring down the cost of living \u2013 can bring about a soft landing without triggering a recession that many analysts believe is on the way. Washington spending showdowns and potential government shutdowns could also pose new threats to growth. The economy will be outside any political leader\u2019s capacity to control, but its state at the end of the year will play a vital role in an election that will define America, domestically and globally after 2024.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden, after returning this week to a politically reshaped Washington, will join top Republican officials to herald his infrastructure law as he seeks out bipartisan cooperation in a new era of divided government. Wednesday\u2019s event in Kentucky, which will include Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is meant to underscore the importance of the massive public works package Biden signed into law in 2021. The area, across the Ohio state line from Cincinnati, is home to the Brent Spence Bridge \u2013 long an illustration of the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure that is due to receive funding from the law for repairs. For Biden, however, perhaps more important than the law itself will be the show of cooperation between Republicans and Democrats as he looks ahead to a contentious second half of his term and the likely start of a reelection bid. As he wound down his winter vacation here on Sunday, the president voiced optimism for the coming year. \u201cGood year next year,\u201d he said as he departed Mass at a local Catholic church, giving a thumbs up. \u201cLooking forward to it.\u201d It was a characteristically optimistic outlook for the president, who enters 2023 having defied projections of a midterm wipeout but still facing a new political reality in Congress. 'Have you heard I was 83?': Hoyer on stepping back from House leadership As Republicans prepare to assume control of the US House of Representatives, Biden is hoping to demonstrate his willingness to work across the aisle, even as GOP lawmakers threaten to stymie his legislative ambitions and barrage the White House with oversight investigations. The president and his team hope the comparison will prove advantageous as Americans look to Washington for steps to ease economic hardships. Over the coming weeks, Biden is expected to reiterate his bipartisan achievements in stops around the country as the Republican majority begins its work, culminating in his yearly State of the Union address. At his stop along the Ohio-Kentucky border on Wednesday, he\u2019ll also be joined by Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, along with two Democrats: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. A number of Cabinet officials also plan to travel later this week to promote the infrastructure law. Vice President Kamala Harris will stop in Chicago and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg will visit New London, Connecticut. They will \u201cdiscuss how the President\u2019s economic plan is rebuilding our infrastructure, creating good-paying jobs \u2013 jobs that don\u2019t require a four-year degree, and revitalizing communities left behind,\u201d a White House official said. NBC News was first to report on the upcoming trips. Biden has spent much of his tenure so far in pursuit of bipartisan legislation, finding success in the infrastructure package along with measures bolstering the US microchip industry, providing funding for Ukraine and guaranteeing health coverage for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. Hope among Democrats at finding areas of agreement with the Republican Congress has been slim, though on certain areas \u2013 including China and, to a certain extent, Ukraine \u2013 they have been guardedly optimistic. In other areas, including spending bills and the looming debt ceiling deadline, aides in both parties are bracing for high-stakes standoffs. Yet at Biden\u2019s direction, White House officials have quietly engaged in early stage preparations for the new reality on Capitol Hill, homing in on two key groups as they search for issues that can draw bipartisan support: moderate Republicans with a proven track record of working across the aisle and the incoming class of freshmen Republicans who flipped districts Biden won two years earlier. Those lawmakers will make up the core of any White House effort to secure the bipartisan wins that officials said Biden is interested in pursuing in the two years ahead. They will also be key to any White House hopes of scuttling Republican bills in the House and attempts to squeeze House GOP leadership on key issues. White House officials are also closely watching the race among Republicans to elect a new House speaker. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, had long been expected to be elevated to the role, but he remains locked in an intraparty battle to consolidate support. Biden spoke to McCarthy by phone shortly after the midterm election and the California Republican was one of four leaders to meet with Biden at the White House a few weeks later. McCarthy, after the meeting, told reporters he \u201ccan work with anyone,\u201d but noted the new Republican majority in the House clinched in the midterms signaled that \u201cAmerica likes a check and balance.\u201d Looming over the president\u2019s efforts at working with Republicans will be his decision on mounting a reelection bid for the White House. Biden has stated repeatedly he intends to run again, but said before his vacation this week to the US Virgin Islands he would consult with family members over the holidays. As he finalizes his decision, work has been underway to build a campaign to be ready when the president announces his intentions. Many Democrats close to Biden say they are convinced he will run again, and there appears to be little dissent within his family. There was little public evidence of intensive family discussions this week on St. Croix. Biden left his rental home on the eastern end of the island to golf, eat dinner, go to church and tape an appearance on Ryan Seacrest\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve broadcast, but otherwise remained out of view. After much local speculation, he and his family decided to forgo a sunrise hike on New Year\u2019s Day to Point Udall \u2013 billed as the easternmost point in the United States. Instead, Biden appeared to have spent the week in intensive relaxation with his wife, children and grandchildren, perhaps lightly peppered with a few conversations about the year ahead. As he was departing dinner just past 9 p.m. one evening, he was asked whether he\u2019d discussed his 2024 plans with his family. \u201cThere\u2019s an election coming up?\u201d he asked, smiling. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cO, for a muse of fire,\u201d pleads the chorus at the outset of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry V.\u201d It seeks to \u201cascend the brightest heaven of invention\u201d and conjure up \u201cthe vasty fields of France\u201d on a tiny stage to transport the audience back in history. Drama could be had last week without a need for the kind of exertions Shakespeare and his troupe employed at London\u2019s Globe theater more than 400 years ago. A former president of the United States appeared in a New York courtroom to face criminal charges. The borders of NATO grew dramatically as Finland joined the alliance. Pivotal elections in Wisconsin and Chicago demonstrated voters\u2019 increasing affinity for progressive politics. Tennessee legislators targeted three members of the state House for joining a gun control protest in the chamber, expelling two young Black men while failing to oust a 60-year-old White woman. And then on Friday evening, a federal judge in Texas issued a ruling suspending the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval, granted 23 years ago, of one of two drugs often used in medication abortions, which now account for a majority of all abortions in America. (He gave the Biden administration a week to appeal the ruling before it goes into effect. Meanwhile, a judge in Washington state ruled in a different case that the government must continue to make the drug available in 17 states and the District of Columbia.) Thus, the week that began with Trump facing a judge in Manhattan ended with a Trump-appointed judge overturning more than two decades of medical practice. It was another sign that Trump\u2019s impact \u2014 particularly his choice of three conservative Supreme Court judges who helped overturn the right to abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade \u2014 has outlasted his four years in office. The abortion issue not only helped shape the outcome of Wisconsin\u2019s judicial election Tuesday, it also figured in an emerging debate over the right of Americans to travel to other states for medical procedures. Mary Ziegler and Naomi Cahn observed that a new Idaho law, labeled an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d measure, \u201ccriminalizes anyone who helps a minor get an abortion or abortion pills without parental consent. Violators will face felony charges and up to five years in prison.\u201d \u201cThe law could treat anyone, from friends to grandparents, as traffickers \u2026 Idaho Republicans presented the bill as a common-sense protection of parental rights.\u201d \u201cBut make no mistake: Idaho\u2019s bill is part of a broader attack on the right to travel for adults as well as minors, and the stakes of whittling away at that right are higher than ever.\u201d Meanwhile Idaho\u2019s attorney general withdrew a controversial letter he issued last month that said the state \u201cprohibits an Idaho medical provider from either referring a woman across state lines to access abortion services or prescribing abortion pills for the woman to pick up across state lines.\u201d The Republicans in the Tennessee state House of Representatives who expelled Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were \u201cusing their power as a tool of intimidation,\u201d wrote Jemar Tisby. \u201cWhat other conclusion can be drawn from the inappropriate and disproportionate response to a decorum infraction?\u201d But their tactic backfired in a spectacular way, Tisby wrote. The vote has raised the profile of the two state representatives to national prominence, and \u201cinstead of dissuading Tennesseans from their calls for gun control, Republican legislators seem to have energized the people and motivated them to resist even more vigorously.\u201d As SE Cupp observed, some Republican leaders and right-wing commentators have described the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol as \u201ctotally fine, no big deal, and those protesters are patriots who should be left alone. But the three Democratic lawmakers who briefly protested inaction on gun control \u2014 a protest that led to zero violence and wasn\u2019t an attempted crime \u2014 that\u2019s unacceptable and those lawmakers should lose their jobs.\u201d In Cupp\u2019s view, it\u2019s \u201canother example of the GOP attacking democracy. They haven\u2019t been able to convince a majority of voters to support their far-right extreme agenda, so instead they want to make it harder to vote, harder to protest, harder to access information.\u201d Trump\u2019s critics had waited years for this moment. His supporters had spent months bitterly denouncing the process leading up to it. But when the former president took his seat at the defense table in a Manhattan criminal courtroom Tuesday, the event was something of an anti-climax. \u201cBeneath the familiar swoop of dyed-blond hair and thick foundation, his expression was grim and reserved,\u201d wrote Nicole Hemmer. \u201cFor the moment, he was just another defendant, dependent on a judge to determine his next move. And while Trump will work hard in the coming hours and days to offer a different reading of those images \u2014 and media outlets will be tempted to help him out by focusing on the spectacle \u2014 they depict not a departure from regular order, but rather its return.\u201d Trump wanted a mug shot, according to two sources cited by CNN, but he didn\u2019t get one. \u201cInstead of a defiant N.Y.P.D. photo or a raised fist,\u201d David Firestone wrote in the New York Times, \u201cthe lasting image of the day may well be that of a humbled former president looking hunched, angry and nervous at the courtroom defense table, a suddenly small man wedged between his lawyers, as two New York State court officers loomed behind him in a required posture of making sure the defendant stayed in his place.\u201d  In some ways, a prosecution of Trump was a long time coming, observed Fareed Zakaria. \u201cFor decades he has flouted rules, norms and even laws as he climbed his way to the top, brazenly convinced that the usual standards didn\u2019t apply to him. His company was found guilty of tax fraud, he\u2019s been taken to court countless times over unpaid bills, and he\u2019s even stolen money from his own charities.\u201d But was this the right case to bring? \u201cThe prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, is an elected district attorney who ran a campaign for that office boasting that he had helped sue Donald Trump \u2018more than a hundred times,\u2019\u201d Zakaria noted. \u201cEven so, once elected and after looking over the evidence, he is reported to have put the case on the back burner, which triggered a storm of criticism from his Democratic base. He then reversed course and decided to pursue the case on a new basis, if reported accounts are correct \u2026 this case has the feel of zealous prosecutors minutely examining all possibilities to find some violation of the law.\u201d John Dean and Norman Eisen argued that \u201cthere\u2019s no good reason to exempt Trump from prosecution when his former lawyer Michael Cohen went to prison for his role in surreptitiously moving these funds to benefit the campaign, as have others for similar conduct.\u201d \u201cThe violation for falsifying books and records is a clear one: These were alleged hush-money payments by Trump and his entities that they are accused of falsely entering into their records as legal fees.\u201d In contrast, David Orentlicher, wrote that \u201cTrump\u2019s relationship with adult film star Stormy Daniels and his alleged payments to her, via his former lawyer Michael Cohen, raise substantial ethical concerns \u2014 but they are not matters that should be addressed in a courtroom.\u201d President Joe Biden noted in a CNN Opinion commentary that Passover is all about telling \u201cthe miraculous story of the Jewish people\u2019s exodus from slavery in Egypt to freedom. It is a timeless, powerful story of faith, hope and redemption that has inspired oppressed people everywhere for generations.\u201d \u201cBut Passover is more than just a recounting of the past. It is also a cautionary tale of the present and our future as a democracy. As Jews read from the Haggadah about how evil in every generation has tried to destroy them, antisemitism is rising to record levels today,\u201d Biden wrote. He described several ways the government is addressing the issue. \u201cBut government alone cannot root out antisemitism and hate. All Americans, including businesses and community leaders, educators, students, athletes, entertainers and influencers must help confront bigotry in all its forms. We must each do our part to create a culture of respect in our workplaces, in our schools, on our social media and in our homes.\u201d \u201cBecause hate never goes away, it only hides until it is given just a little oxygen.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has suffered setback after setback. One of his biggest defeats came Tuesday, when Finland officially joined NATO. In launching the war in February 2022, \u201cPutin argued that his goal was to prevent NATO from expanding,\u201d as Frida Ghitis recalled. \u201cOn that count, Putin not only failed, but in fact propelled the very development he sought to prevent. Now Russia\u2019s border with NATO countries has more than doubled in length, adding an extra 830 miles of frontier with Finland.\u201d \u201cFinland, which was once part of the Russian empire \u2026 will move quickly to fortify that long border. That\u2019s because when Russia invaded Ukraine, it sent an unmistakable signal to its neighbors that it simply could not be trusted.\u201d This weekend\u2019s holidays of Good Friday and Easter have fundamentally different messages in some contexts, according to religious studies scholar Bart D. Ehrman. One view sees Jesus on Easter as \u201cthe Christ of the Apocalypse, where the \u2018lamb who was slaughtered\u2019 comes back for blood, wreaking vengeance on a world that rejected him before judging the earth and ordering those who are not among his most faithful followers to be thrown into a lake of burning sulfur.\u201d The better course is the message of Good Friday: the Jesus of the Gospels, Ehrman writes. His followers \u201care not to assert power or \u2018lord it over others.\u2019 They are to be humble and meek. They are to feed the hungry, welcome strangers, tend to the sick, sell what they have and give to the poor \u2014 even those they don\u2019t know, strangers, foreigners, followers of other religions. Most emphatically, Jesus insists his followers not be violent, not seek revenge, not return evil for evil. They are to turn the other cheek; they are to love their enemies.\u201d For more: Kathryn Reklis: Why I finally decided to watch \u2018The Chosen\u2019 Sweden\u2019s Greta Thunberg was joined by Stanford student organizer Sophia Kianni and Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate in warning that the Biden administration is going down the wrong path by greenlighting the Willow Project in Alaska and opening 73 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling. \u201cYoung people and members of marginalized communities are the ones who will bear the brunt of the consequences of the escalating climate emergency,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe rubber-stamping of such a project sends a message not just to our generation but humanity as a whole: The future of our planet and the present well-being of frontline communities are being sacrificed for short-term economic gain and political expediency.\u201d On the right, Trump\u2019s indictment energized the MAGA base, giving the former president a lift over potential rivals for the 2024 nomination. But on the left, a victory in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election Tuesday suggested that Democrats may be better positioned to assemble winning voter coalitions than their GOP rivals \u2014 particularly when abortion is a leading issue. \u201cIf Republicans are going to reverse their fortunes in\u201d the suburban counties surrounding Milwaukee, \u201cthey\u2019re going to have to settle the abortion issue,\u201d observed James Wigderson, a Wisconsin-based conservative writer. \u201cAccording to the Marquette University Law School poll, the majority of independent voters remains consistently opposed to the Dobbs decision overturning Roe. Those independent voters, especially women, are now pulling the lever for the Democrats.\u201d \u201cBut Republicans are also going to have to end the blood contract with Trump. The trend of the Republicans losing suburban votes began before Roe v.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. More than a decade has passed since Mitt Romney lost political support during his failed 2012 presidential campaign for boasting about having \u201cbinders full of women\u201d suitable for government appointments and writing off the \u201c47% of Americans\u201d who pay no federal income tax. But his remark about Russia being America\u2019s \u201cnumber one geopolitical foe\u201d \u2014 which was widely ridiculed at the time \u2014 now seems prescient in the wake of Vladimir Putin\u2019s murderous invasion of Ukraine. In the past few years, the senator from Utah has earned a reputation for being a rare, candid voice in Washington, willing to buck his party. He was the lone Republican who voted to remove President Donald Trump from office in his first impeachment trial and one of seven to do so in Trump\u2019s second impeachment. Minutes before the State of the Union speech Tuesday, Romney encountered the scandal-ridden Republican Rep. George Santos on the House floor and told him what many of the New York congressman\u2019s constituents \u2014 and others around the country \u2014 are saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d (Santos told reporters afterward: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very Mormon of him.\u201d) Even more tellingly, Romney broke with his party\u2019s stance on China\u2019s spy balloon. After a closed-door briefing by administration officials Thursday, Romney told reporters, \u201cI believe that the administration, the president, our military and intelligence agencies, acted skillfully and with care,\u201d and said he agreed with their decision to wait to shoot down the balloon until it moved over the Atlantic Ocean, off the Carolinas. House Republicans, who were initially planning a resolution condemning the Biden administration for not bringing down the balloon sooner, switched the wording to condemn the government of China for sending the craft over US territory in the first place. It passed 419-0, a small act of bipartisanship only two days after a group of House Republicans heckled President Joe Biden as he was addressing both houses in his annual speech. There are not a lot of Romneys \u2014 or indeed any \u2014 in the ranks of the extreme GOPers who bucked their own House Speaker\u2019s shushing to shout their displeasure at Biden\u2019s remarks. \u201cSome members of the Republican caucus seemed keen to highlight the distinctions between the thoughtful, unity-emphasizing Biden and their own party\u2019s shameful descent,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, among others, repeatedly booed and yelled throughout the speech; when he introduced the parents of Tyre Nichols, who was last month fatally beaten by Memphis police officers, and the Ukrainian ambassador, she stayed seated. That perhaps says more than Biden ever could.\u201d SE Cupp called McCarthy\u2019s \u201cshushing\u201d a \u201csurprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the House Oversight Committee with election deniers.\u201d \u201cWill he continue to \u2018shush\u2019 the extremist, conspiratorial and \u2018Never Biden\u2019 wing of his party \u2014 whom he has empowered and elevated \u2014 as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with Biden from time to time?\u201d Geoff Duncan, a Republican who formerly served as Georgia\u2019s lieutenant governor, wrote that \u201cneither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the president \u2014 despite both issues being of importance to voters. Neither did the Chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines Biden\u2019s tough talk toward Chinese President Xi Jinping.\u201d Biden \u201cwas feisty, full of energy, marshaled his arguments effectively and even batted back Republican catcalls with good humor,\u201d observed David Gergen. \u201cBy the end of the evening, he looked like a boxer who can\u2019t wait to get into the ring again.\u201d \u201cBut he now faces an even sterner test: Did he actually move the needle? Among presidents of the recent past, a public appearance as powerful as this one could shake up politics. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan each had the capacity to change minds when they held a microphone.\u201d The president\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of \u2018the talk\u2019 that Black parents give to their children about how to safely interact with police officers was the most moving part of his speech,\u201d wrote former Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Democrat. \u201cStill, it was political malpractice for him not to explicitly call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The family of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was fatally beaten by Memphis police officers last month, deserved to hear it.\u201d Raul Reyes noted that \u201cBiden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use American-made materials.\u201d The 80-year-old president\u2019s vision was decidedly blue-collar \u2014 and 20th century \u2014 in its aim to rebuild America\u2019s manufacturing base and reduce the reliance on trade with the rest of the world. But, as Julian Zelizer pointed out, \u201ctimes have changed and Biden has a tough road ahead. While the president offered a robust vision of how federal investment has and could create jobs in key sectors such as the semi-conductor industry and infrastructure, the kinds of manufacturing jobs that were at the heart of federal investment between the 1930s and 1960s have vastly diminished and are not likely to return.\u201d \u201cBiden needs to acknowledge how his economic populism will address the industries of the 2020s rather than those of the 1950s and 1960s.\u201d Biden\u2019s success in 2020 owed a lot to the contrast with the chaos and extremism of the Trump administration, Bill McGowan and Juliana Silva wrote. The outbursts by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her colleagues allow Biden to surf the same wave now. \u201cBy keeping the hostility factor high, the GOP is also paving the way for Biden to reuse in 2024 one of his stickiest and most effective campaign messages from 2020: that the election is nothing short of a battle for the \u2018soul of the nation.\u2019 Thanks to the new breed of attention-seeking, far-right Republicans, Biden gets to go back to that well regardless of whether Trump is his opponent or not.\u201d The president turned the heckling to his advantage by getting Republicans to deny any intention of cutting Social Security or Medicare. \u201cYou can say Mr. Biden fibbed, misled and exaggerated, and you wouldn\u2019t be wrong,\u201d Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal, \u201cbut in rope-a-doping Republicans on Medicare and Social Security he showed real mastery.\u201d In \u201ca scathing rebuke\u201d to Biden\u2019s speech that served as the GOP\u2019s official reply, \u201cArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it\u2019s time for a new generation of Republican leadership,\u201d Alice Stewart noted. \u201cAt 40, Sanders is the youngest governor in the country. She spoke of Biden as the oldest president in American history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply \u2018unfit to serve as commander in chief.\u2019\u201d Left unsaid was that Trump, Sanders\u2019 former boss, would be 78 by Election Day, 2024 \u2014 and he is running for the presidency again. Patrick T. Brown spoke for a lot of Americans when he pleaded for something other than a Biden-Trump rematch: \u201cA 2024 presidential election that features another slugfest between two elderly leaders rather than a scrappy fight between up-and-coming politicians with energy and enthusiasm would be doing the nation a disservice.\u201d \u201cNew polling suggests a growing desire for new faces. 58% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters told a Washington Post/ABC News poll they hoped their party nominates someone other than Biden in 2024. According to the poll, 49% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said the same thing about former President Donald Trump.\u201d For more: Jennifer Rodgers: Former Manhattan prosecutor has given Trump a gift John Avlon: Four key moments from Biden\u2019s State of the Union Twitter roundup: Biden gets feisty, baits Republicans Dr. Abdurrahman Alomar and his family were jolted awake at 4:17 am Monday in their sixth-floor apartment in Gaziantep, Turkey. A devastating earthquake had struck and they hurried out of the building in their pajamas into snow-filled streets. Taking refuge in their car, away from any buildings, Alomar spoke to CNN Opinion\u2019s Sheena McKenzie about the toll the quake is taking on a region already devastated by war. Alomar is a pediatrician who works as a senior health adviser with the Syrian American Medical Society, providing medical assistance across the border. \u201cIn northwest Syria, we are already suffering from a shortage of supplies, and we are now using the regular inventories in our warehouses,\u201d Alomar said. \u201cSo we are in urgent need of additional support to compensate these supplies for regular operations \u2014 and also to be ready for aftershocks and more casualties who may come to our hospitals.\u201d In the New York Times, Turkish author and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk wrote, \u201cAid has been dispatched, but the trucks loaded with supplies are stuck for hours on jammed roads hundreds of miles from the affected areas. People who have lost their homes, their families, their loved ones, everything they ever had find that there is nobody doing anything about the fires beginning to break out in their cities. And so they block the path of any official vehicle, policeman or government employee they can find and start to remonstrate. I have never seen our people so angry.\u201d As of Sunday, the death toll in the quake stood at more than 28,000, with tens of thousands injured. A year ago, shortly before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, former comedian-turned-president \u201cVolodymyr Zelensky\u2019s popularity ratings were tanking as he battled allegations of unmet campaign promises to tackle endemic corruption,\u201d recalled Michael Bociurkiw. \u201cThen on February 24, Russia\u2019s total invasion blasted these concerns into the background. Almost overnight, that dark cloud over Zelensky vanished as he defied critics, and miraculously pivoted into the role of heroic wartime president and global symbol of defender of the free world.\u201d \u201cHis popularity ratings surged \u2014 and have stayed high ever since \u2014 currently hovering at around 84%.\u201d  But corruption is still pervasive in Ukraine, as recent allegations and a new crackdown have shown, and Bociurkiw argued that it\u2019s vital to keep fighting it. \u201cZelensky needs to respond to allegations of wrongdoing with the same determination that Ukrainian servicemen have demonstrated on the battlefield.\u201d \u201cThis is an opportunity to create a nation where corruption is not tolerated, and where oligarchs no longer have a free hand to rape and pillage the economy.\u201d For more: Anshel Pfeffer: Why Netanyahu is suddenly a lot less friendly with Putin What would China have done if a US balloon entered its airspace, intelligence analyst Beth Sanner asked. China would have shot it down \u201cwithout hesitation, regardless of any risk to Chinese citizens or property.\u201d \u201cSo China\u2019s protestations about the outrageousness of the US shootdown of a spy balloon flying over our sovereign territory seem a little rich, to put it mildly,\u201d Sanner wrote. \u201cI understand why Americans were alarmed by the balloon,\u201d she added, \u201cbut there are much bigger threats posed by China. We should address the shortcomings this incident exposed \u2014 including what appears to be gaps in our air defense and detection systems that would have allowed us to shoot such a balloon down before it ever reached US landfall \u2014 but political one-upmanship on such a fraught and grave matter as relations with China is dangerous.\u201d Napoleon\u2019s soldiers used balloons for surveillance in 1794, as did Union soldiers during the US Civil War. Peter Bergen\u2019s father worked on a US Air Force program that sent balloons over the Soviet Union in the 1950s, Bergen wrote. But there\u2019s newer technology in the form of satellites that can take video, use thermal imagery to detect people moving around at night and \u201cspy on pretty much anything, with a resolution of centimeters,\u201d Bergen noted. \u201cIn other words, the overflight of US territory by China\u2019s balloon is not a national security catastrophe as a bunch of hyperventilating Republican politicians from former President Donald Trump on downward have implied,\u201d Bergen added.

Chocolate ice cream for breakfast, a hot dog with mustard and relish for lunch: Those are the reported meal selections of the 82-year-old former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Lots of other lifestyle choices, plus genetics, may enable people to do just fine with such a diet. But CNN Opinion\u2019s Kirsi Goldynia wrote, \u201cAs endearing as it is to imagine a politician scarfing down a frank with all the fixings or a bowl of chocolate ice cream, new research is exposing the health impacts of diets like Pelosi\u2019s, high in ultraprocessed foods.\u201d \u201cPelosi isn\u2019t an outlier. In the US, a whopping 58% of adults\u2019 daily calories, and 67% of kids\u2019 daily calories, come from ultraprocessed foods, according to cancer epidemiologist Fang Fang Zhang.\u201d A raft of recent studies has demonstrated that consuming ultraprocessed foods increases the risk of cancer and cognitive decline as people age. Goldynia interviewed Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert and retired professor at New York University. \u201cStudies show that ultraprocessed foods encourage people to eat more calories,\u201d Nestle said, \u201cand the subjects gain weight as a result. So, if you want to do something about obesity, and you want to lose weight, one way to do that would be to eat fewer ultraprocessed foods\u2026 If you\u2019re somebody who can\u2019t resist this stuff if you have it in the house, don\u2019t buy it.\u201d Rosalyn R.

Morral: Addressing gun violence requires better means of measuring it AND\u2026 A year after celebrities were paid lavishly to endorse cryptocurrencies in Super Bowl ads, the mood is different. \u201cCrypto winter\u201d set in, and one of the leading companies in the field, FTX, collapsed spectacularly. Kara Alaimo wrote, \u201cSo far this year, brands seem to not be sticking their necks out. In a Doritos ad, paparazzi bombard rapper Jack Harlow with questions about a love triangle. Budweiser\u2019s spot is based on the theory that we\u2019re all connected by six degrees of separation. Serena Williams takes up golf in an ad for Michelob Ultra\u2026\u201d \u201cOne ad that may buck the trend of brands playing it safe this Super Bowl is M&M\u2019S. The company recently claimed to be putting its spokescandies on \u2018pause\u2019 after they got caught up in the culture wars. After the green M&M started wearing sneakers instead of heeled boots last year, the company received a wave of criticism. \u2026 The brand would be smart to stay woke.

Still, as Gene Seymour wrote, Brady \u201chas been so habitually labeled the greatest quarterback, and \u2014 remarkably, by some \u2014 as the greatest football player period (!), that the GOAT acronym has, to all intents and purposes, become virtually synonymous with his name.\u201d On Tuesday, LeBron James broke the career scoring record in the NBA, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. \u201cThe GOAT chants are building to a fervent pitch around James\u2019s name against those who believe Michael Jordan closed off the GOAT discussion in professional basketball with his six titles with the Chicago Bulls.\u201d All of the GOAT-talk leaves Seymour cold. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge those filling hours at a barber shop or a corner bar arguing about who is or isn\u2019t a GOAT. I\u2019m just asking to leave me out of it. I\u2019m now content to say there are performers in many arenas I feel closest to in spirit because of how they do their work, play their games, sing their songs. They\u2019re likely not all-time greats and have been superseded by newer, younger talent. But they\u2019re great enough for me.\u201d",

            "article_content": "CNN Opinion contributors assess the high and lows of President Biden\u2019s 2023 State of Union speech. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Joe Biden\u2019s polling may be weak, but his strategic position is strong. Coming off the most productive first two years of any president since Lyndon B. Johnson, Biden\u2019s political priorities have shifted from legislation to implementation. He has already achieved more in two years than most presidents in eight: the biggest investment in the middle class since Franklin Roosevelt, in infrastructure since Dwight Eisenhower, in health care since Barack Obama and in climate change and chip technology in history. Then there\u2019s the biggest expansion of veterans\u2019 benefits since World War II, the first gun safety law since Bill Clinton \u2014 and with this week\u2019s jobs report, the lowest US unemployment rate since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were walking on the moon. With Republicans now in control of the House, Biden is freed from the messy business of actually passing bills. Instead, as in tonight\u2019s State of the Union Address, he can propose wildly popular programs and challenge Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his band of not-so-merry men and women to pass them \u2014 or not. Capping insulin for all Americans at $35 a month, providing free community college, restoring the Child Tax Credit \u2014 which lifted almost one in three poor children out of poverty \u2014 and raising taxes on corporate stock buybacks: all these Biden initiatives will have enormous appeal across the US and across party lines. McCarthy will be faced with an impossible choice: either give Biden a popular accomplishment to run on or give him an appealing issue to run on. For Biden, it\u2019s a win-win proposition. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. Here\u2019s the reality about the State of the Union these days: Most Americans are not watching. Most big political speeches say things people have heard over and over again. More taxes on the richest Americans, the importance of infrastructure, raising teacher pay, lowing health care costs \u2014 all stances that poll relatively well. But voters are used to politicians making these promises. What will stand out most, then, are the things that voters may not have heard in a State of the Union before, the things that make clips the next day. President Joe Biden goading Republicans into battle by accusing them of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare is the moment that will lead the headlines. Republicans, of course, denied the accusation vociferously and stood up for seniors. Prior to that moment, the speech was lower in energy and unlikely to reassure to Democrats skittish about 2024. After that moment, his demeanor was more combative and energetic, closer to what Democrats presumably are hoping for on the 2024 campaign trail. Kristen Soltis Anderson, a CNN political commentator, is a Republican strategist and pollster and author of \u201cThe Selfie Vote: Where Millennials Are Leading America (and How Republicans Can Keep Up).\u201d President Joe Biden delivered a speech combining elements from across the political spectrum to paint a picture of an America the majority of voters can actually recognize. It wasn\u2019t \u201ccarnage\u201d and it wasn\u2019t unbridled hope, but it was real talk about what it means to be resilient, work hard and expect more from your government. However, the contrast with a message that resonates with the majority of the American public and the political reality in the chamber is stark. Biden grabbed the MAGA message of losing pride in America, but rather than going backward to a pre-civil rights era, he reflected it back onto feeling unmoored in recent years. He adopted the language calling the attack on the Capitol an insurrection, referring to January 6 as the day \u201cour democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\u201d But many members in the audience still support the lie that the 2020 election was stolen and are part of that threat to democracy. A statement as basic as everyone should \u201cpay your fair share of taxes,\u201d and it\u2019s wrong for corporations \u201cmaking record profits while paying zero in taxes\u201d was met with stone-faced looks from half the chamber, even when Biden pointed out that an oil and gas company paying 15% tax is less than what a nurse pays. Biden talked about police brutality as a matter of helping parents protect their children, acknowledging the reality that the majority of people in the room never have to have \u201cthe talk\u201d or worry about their sons on the road the way Black and rown families do. Biden said making sure Tyre Nichols\u2019 mother\u2019s wish \u201cfor something good to come out of this\u201d is everyone\u2019s responsibility, placing the onus on Congress and White people to join the fight for police reform. He got down the most relatable aspects of policy \u2014 that when families who feel pinched in the pocketbook can finally afford a vacation, we get hit with resort fees at places that \u201caren\u2019t even a resort\u201d and airlines force parents to pay to be seated with their children. It\u2019s all part of Biden\u2019s narrative about government as a force for good. Biden took the idea of democracy, the possibility of what good it can do in our lives and made it concrete again. Too bad this current Congress is operating in an alternate reality. Nayyera Haq is a radio host at SiriusXM. She was host of \u201cThe World Tonight\u201d on The Black News Channel and is a former White House senior director. President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech served as the launch of his 2024 reelection. He shared many familiar themes with Americans, albeit without much in the way of specifics or price tags. Delivered in a folksy manner, Biden\u2019s speech called for higher taxes on the wealthy, as he took his usual shots at private sector companies for not paying their \u201cfair share\u201d \u2014 music to the ears of his progressive base. But for middle-of-the-road voters, neither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the President \u2014 despite both issues being of importance to voters. Neither did the Chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines Biden\u2019s tough talk toward Chinese President Xi Jinping. Biden recounted his past legislative accomplishments without offering much in the way of concrete areas of bipartisan agreement going forward, which is a requirement for anything to pass a divided Congress. Never known as the world\u2019s best orator, Biden seemed to be enjoying himself. After some of his early jokes landed awkwardly, he came out of the gates at a rapid clip, doing his best to allay concerns about his age and fitness for another national campaign. Geoff Duncan, a CNN political contributor, served as Georgia\u2019s Lieutenant Governor from 2019-2023. He is a former professional baseball player and the author of \u201cGOP 2.0: How the 2020 Election Can Lead to a Better Way Forward for America\u2019s Conservative Party.\u201d On Tuesday, President Joe Biden again defied expectations and delivered his State of the Union address with a combination of charm, humor and gusto centered on a clear theme: \u201cLet\u2019s finish the job.\u201d While Biden extended an olive branch to Republicans and called for bipartisan cooperation, he also sent a clear message that he is more than up for the fight against the GOP. Time and again, Biden gave as good as he got from a rowdy GOP caucus, maintaining greater control of the room in the face of heckling than Kevin McCarthy has since the 15 rounds it took for him to become House speaker. In one exchange, Biden even called out Republican members who celebrated funding for their constituents in the very infrastructure bill they voted against. Biden was fearless as he masterfully boxed Republicans into publicly opposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, nor did he shrink from naming the horror of January 6 and the vicious consequences of the 2020 election lie and divisive political rhetoric. Biden was also fearless as he adeptly wove together the painful reality of \u201cthe talk\u201d Black parents have with their kids about how to interact with the police and humanized all sides of a renewed call for criminal justice and policing reforms rooted in core American values of trust, public safety, accountability, mutual respect and equal protection under law.

It\u2019s hard to think how Joe Biden could have delivered a better performance than he did tonight.  He was feisty, full of energy, marshaled his arguments effectively and even batted back Republican catcalls with good humor. By the end of the evening, he looked like a boxer who can\u2019t wait to get into the ring again. But he now faces an even sterner test: Did he actually move the needle? Among presidents of the recent past, a public appearance as powerful as this one could shake up politics. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan each had the capacity to change minds when they held a microphone. When Biden\u2019s presidency wasn\u2019t going well, it was easy to understand why he was mired deep in the polls. But he has had a string of successes in recent months, and yet his approval rating is still stuck in the low 40s.  One can only imagine the frustration he has felt. Perhaps Biden, on Tuesday, began getting through to prospective or wavering voters, persuading some \u2014 maybe even many \u2014 of them to join up for his reelection campaign.  If so, Democratic strategists will become much more confident about his prospects for reelection.  But if he doesn\u2019t pick up steam after a night like this, they may wander off the reservation.

President Joe Biden\u2019s discussion of \u201cthe talk\u201d that Black parents give to their children about how to safely interact with police officers was the most moving part of his speech. Still, it was political malpractice for him not to explicitly call for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The family of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was fatally beaten by Memphis police officers last month, deserved to hear it. Meanwhile, the interracial, intergenerational coalition of voters that got Biden elected needed to hear it. For Black and brown communities who bear the brunt of police brutality, it can seem like forever ago that America experienced what may have been the largest protest movement in its nearly 247-year history following the murder of Floyd in 2020. Fast forward to 2023, and even after two years of controlling the executive and legislative branches of government, Democrats were unable to pass a comprehensive police reform bill. Such is the nature of the filibuster and GOP opposition to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Even if Congress doesn\u2019t pass meaningful policing reform this term, it\u2019s important for Biden to remind key constituencies he\u2019s still fighting for it. 2024 is around the corner, and the voters who backed him last time will want to know this issue is still a priority for the president.

President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech was the most Joe Biden that voters have seen from Joe Biden since the election \u2014 good for most Americans, but somewhat disappointing for abortion rights activists and other progressives. Biden emphasized both his administration\u2019s pocketbook accomplishments and his agenda for shoring up the middle class. From gas prices to keeping working class jobs in America, Biden sang the song of his (perhaps imagined) base: the White working class man. The trick, though, comes in standing up for what\u2019s right even while speaking to the masses. This was the first State of the Union since the Supreme Court stripped a fundamental right from American women in overturning Roe v. Wade. But abortion didn\u2019t merit a mention until well into the speech \u2014 despite the fact that, for women, the right to decide when and whether to have children is as fundamental a concern as outsourced jobs or federal contracts. Still, as frustrating as I found Biden\u2019s scant coverage of the issues I care about, it\u2019s hard to deny he did extraordinarily well connecting with his audience, and particularly with emphasizing exactly what the Trump GOP doesn\u2019t: that democracy matters; that we all share the same hope for a great nation; that we can work on this project together instead of demonizing each other. And some members of the Republican caucus seemed keen to highlight the distinctions between the thoughtful, unity-emphasizing Biden and their own party\u2019s shameful descent. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, among others, repeatedly booed and yelled throughout the speech; when he introduced the parents of Tyre Nichols, who was last month fatally beaten by Memphis police officers, and the Ukrainian ambassador, she stayed seated. That perhaps says more than Biden ever could. This was Biden\u2019s night. I wish he was a different president. But he\u2019s the president most Americans chose \u2014 and, on Tuesday, he talked to Americans as a collective force, whether they supported him or not. Even someone who isn\u2019t a huge fan can see why Americans love to hear that. Let\u2019s hope that the Joe Biden who goes to work in the West Wing tomorrow does what he promised \u2014 and all he should have said.

Tonight, Biden\u2019s job was twofold: to highlight his administration\u2019s achievements, and to make the case for his presumed second run at the presidency. His speech was a success on both counts. Biden smartly aligned himself with populist issues, like making wealthy corporations pay their fair share of taxes and proposing that all federal infrastructure projects use American-made materials. Just as important as putting forth these substantive ideas, the president seemed vigorous and, at times, fiery. This is the Joe Biden who is ready to hit the campaign trail. He clearly enjoyed giving this speech \u2013 especially when he, in effect, publicly dared Republicans to oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare. As a native of Monterey Park, California, it is still surreal to me that my hometown experienced a mass shooting last month that claimed the lives of 11 people. So it was incredibly moving when the president thanked Brandon Tsay for his heroism disarming the suspected gunman in the attack. It was a poignant reminder of our continuing need for gun reform \u2013 as well as deserved recognition of a brave American. On immigration, the president urged his fellow lawmakers to \u201ccome together\u2026 and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.\u201d He cited his administration\u2019s new efforts at the border yet noted that immigration problems won\u2019t be fixed until Congress acts. He\u2019s absolutely right; at best, the president alone can make only temporary fixes to our immigration system. How telling that this common-sense section of his speech seemed to generate heckling in the House, with some members chanting, \u201cSecure the border.\u201d This illustrates the president\u2019s dilemma: Like many Americans, he supports reasonable immigration reform. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, are fixated on generating chaos and division around the issue. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden took a conciliatory tone with the new Republican House Majority, urging on several occasions for both parties to work together. But some Republicans did not return the favor. The unrulier members of the GOP yelled out multiple times during his State of the Union address, and true to form, Biden tried reasoning with them as they booed him or interjected. But the most notable moment of the night was when the new Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy visibly shushed his own conference as members yelled, \u201cSecure the border!\u201d It was a surprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the House Oversight Committee with election deniers. But the shushing \u2014  a motion McCarthy repeated several times over the course of the speech \u2014 was also symbolic of his troubled road ahead as speaker. Will he continue to \u201cshush\u201d the extremist, conspiratorial and \u201cNever Biden\u201d wing of his party \u2014  whom he has empowered and elevated \u2014 as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with Biden from time to time? SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator. President Joe Biden brought receipts to the State of the Union \u2014 and I was here for every moment. Presidents almost always list noteworthy accomplishments in their speeches, but rarely do they engage with opponents in the room to double down on their points. On Tuesday, Biden did just that. His banter called for Republicans to make it clear where they stood on important issues like the debt ceiling or support for Medicaid and Social Security. Specifically, Biden claimed some Republicans were prepared to let the US default on its debt were cuts to the popular programs not included in budget negotiations \u2014 an assertion which triggered a vocal pushback from some members of the GOP caucus present. And he swiftly framed that raucous response as a consensus that wouldn\u2019t be the case; in other words, any backtracking they do on the issue is now easily labeled as bad faith flip-flopping. Some will complain his words didn\u2019t work to unify the country; I\u2019d argue we cannot be unified without speaking the truth, and Biden called that out. He spoke to his base and let them know he did not forget why he is able to stand at that podium. Whether you like it or not, this speech made it clear that Biden is running for a second term. And he seems like he is ready to fight for the American people and for every American\u2019s vote.

After making little mention of the \u201cUnity Agenda\u201d since he first announced it in his 2022 State of the Union address, President Joe Biden devoted the end of this year\u2019s speech to his plans to end cancer, support veterans, address mental health and combat the opioid epidemic. These goals, the White House is calculating, are ideal for a period when it expects Congress to pass few bills and for House Republicans to focus on investigations of Biden\u2019s family and his administration. The \u201cUnity Agenda\u201d does not represent outreach to his opponents; it is a package of uncontroversial proposals that he is daring Republicans to resist. This is consistent with the way the President has understood \u201cthe way of unity\u201d the last two years. A creature of the Senate, Biden\u2019s approach has focused on passing popular legislation most Americans will understand and appreciate, while drawing attention \u2014 and political energy \u2014 away from the divisive identity politics and culture wars that fueled the rise of Donald Trump. Just as he did Tuesday evening when he emphasized the American middle class, support for blue collar workers and \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d without mentioning sensationalized issues like critical race theory or transgender bathrooms, Biden\u2019s strategy has been to capture the center of American politics and isolate the antics of far-right leaders controlling the Republican Party. Indeed, striking this contrast has worked out politically for Democrats, who swayed independents and moderates in the 2020 and 2022 elections. But it has done little to actually unify the country. Recent polls suggest Americans are just as divided as they were before the midterms, and a solid majority expect little more than partisan gridlock from Washington the next two years.

If this look at the past two years has a message for the next two, it is that Biden is in a strong position to succeed in that quest. The speech, from a man who is not known for his eloquence, was surprisingly effective. Biden was not just confident and humorous; he also made a powerful case for how successful his presidency has been on many fronts. Reducing unemployment to historic lows, restoring America\u2019s alliances, defending democracy against autocratic assaults around the world. Amazingly, Biden managed to tout his accomplishments and promote his agenda without being overly partisan. He made repeated appeals to bipartisanship, underscored the achievements made with Republican support, and when GOP members heckled him on Social Security, he managed to spar with them from the podium and, with a bit of jujitsu, appeared to secure a bipartisan agreement to leave Social Security benefits untouched. Just like he exceeded expectations during the 2020 primaries, Biden did it again with this 2023 State of the Union. We will see after a few days if the speech changed opinions across the country. But the strong speech was a good omen for his 2024 campaign. Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist.

In a scathing rebuke of President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it\u2019s time for a new generation of Republican leadership. At 40, Sanders is the youngest governor in the country. She spoke of Biden as the oldest president in American history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply \u201cunfit to serve as commander in chief.\u201d The GOP response came on the heels of Republicans in the House chamber shouting their frustration with Biden\u2019s comments on the border crisis, Social Security and Medicare cuts and the threat from China. Sanders reiterated their irritation, saying \u201cBiden and the Democrats have failed you. They know it and you know it.\u201d Biden focused his speech on his administration\u2019s accomplishments on unemployment numbers, record new jobs and lower prescription drug prices. But the reality is that just because he says things are better, doesn\u2019t make it so. American people are still suffering. According to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, four in 10 Americans say they are worse off financially since Joe Biden took office. As expected, Sanders took the opportunity to go after Biden and the left\u2019s radical agenda that doesn\u2019t meet the hard realities Americans face every day. She stated Biden is \u201csurrender[ing] his presidency to a woke mob that can\u2019t even tell you what a woman is.\u201d Like it or not, Sanders spoke for many Republicans who believe that despite Biden\u2019s claim that the State of the Union is great, his failure to \u201cdefend our border, defend our skies and defend our people,\u201d puts the State of our Union in peril.

            "article_content": "CNN Opinion contributors assess the high and lows of President Biden\u2019s 2023 State of Union speech. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Joe Biden\u2019s polling may be weak, but his strategic position is strong. Coming off the most productive first two years of any president since Lyndon B. Johnson, Biden\u2019s political priorities have shifted from legislation to implementation. He has already achieved more in two years than most presidents in eight: the biggest investment in the middle class since Franklin Roosevelt, in infrastructure since Dwight Eisenhower, in health care since Barack Obama and in climate change and chip technology in history. Then there\u2019s the biggest expansion of veterans\u2019 benefits since World War II, the first gun safety law since Bill Clinton \u2014 and with this week\u2019s jobs report, the lowest US unemployment rate since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were walking on the moon. With Republicans now in control of the House, Biden is freed from the messy business of actually passing bills. Instead, as in tonight\u2019s State of the Union Address, he can propose wildly popular programs and challenge Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his band of not-so-merry men and women to pass them \u2014 or not. Capping insulin for all Americans at $35 a month, providing free community college, restoring the Child Tax Credit \u2014 which lifted almost one in three poor children out of poverty \u2014 and raising taxes on corporate stock buybacks: all these Biden initiatives will have enormous appeal across the US and across party lines. McCarthy will be faced with an impossible choice: either give Biden a popular accomplishment to run on or give him an appealing issue to run on. For Biden, it\u2019s a win-win proposition. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. Here\u2019s the reality about the State of the Union these days: Most Americans are not watching. Most big political speeches say things people have heard over and over again. More taxes on the richest Americans, the importance of infrastructure, raising teacher pay, lowing health care costs \u2014 all stances that poll relatively well. But voters are used to politicians making these promises. What will stand out most, then, are the things that voters may not have heard in a State of the Union before, the things that make clips the next day. President Joe Biden goading Republicans into battle by accusing them of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare is the moment that will lead the headlines. Republicans, of course, denied the accusation vociferously and stood up for seniors. Prior to that moment, the speech was lower in energy and unlikely to reassure to Democrats skittish about 2024. After that moment, his demeanor was more combative and energetic, closer to what Democrats presumably are hoping for on the 2024 campaign trail. Kristen Soltis Anderson, a CNN political commentator, is a Republican strategist and pollster and author of \u201cThe Selfie Vote: Where Millennials Are Leading America (and How Republicans Can Keep Up).\u201d President Joe Biden delivered a speech combining elements from across the political spectrum to paint a picture of an America the majority of voters can actually recognize. It wasn\u2019t \u201ccarnage\u201d and it wasn\u2019t unbridled hope, but it was real talk about what it means to be resilient, work hard and expect more from your government. However, the contrast with a message that resonates with the majority of the American public and the political reality in the chamber is stark. Biden grabbed the MAGA message of losing pride in America, but rather than going backward to a pre-civil rights era, he reflected it back onto feeling unmoored in recent years. He adopted the language calling the attack on the Capitol an insurrection, referring to January 6 as the day \u201cour democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\u201d But many members in the audience still support the lie that the 2020 election was stolen and are part of that threat to democracy. A statement as basic as everyone should \u201cpay your fair share of taxes,\u201d and it\u2019s wrong for corporations \u201cmaking record profits while paying zero in taxes\u201d was met with stone-faced looks from half the chamber, even when Biden pointed out that an oil and gas company paying 15% tax is less than what a nurse pays. Biden talked about police brutality as a matter of helping parents protect their children, acknowledging the reality that the majority of people in the room never have to have \u201cthe talk\u201d or worry about their sons on the road the way Black and rown families do. Biden said making sure Tyre Nichols\u2019 mother\u2019s wish \u201cfor something good to come out of this\u201d is everyone\u2019s responsibility, placing the onus on Congress and White people to join the fight for police reform. He got down the most relatable aspects of policy \u2014 that when families who feel pinched in the pocketbook can finally afford a vacation, we get hit with resort fees at places that \u201caren\u2019t even a resort\u201d and airlines force parents to pay to be seated with their children. It\u2019s all part of Biden\u2019s narrative about government as a force for good. Biden took the idea of democracy, the possibility of what good it can do in our lives and made it concrete again. Too bad this current Congress is operating in an alternate reality. Nayyera Haq is a radio host at SiriusXM. She was host of \u201cThe World Tonight\u201d on The Black News Channel and is a former White House senior director. President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech served as the launch of his 2024 reelection. He shared many familiar themes with Americans, albeit without much in the way of specifics or price tags. Delivered in a folksy manner, Biden\u2019s speech called for higher taxes on the wealthy, as he took his usual shots at private sector companies for not paying their \u201cfair share\u201d \u2014 music to the ears of his progressive base. But for middle-of-the-road voters, neither the southern border nor inflation received much attention from the President \u2014 despite both issues being of importance to voters. Neither did the Chinese spy balloon, whose coast-to-coast journey undermines Biden\u2019s tough talk toward Chinese President Xi Jinping. Biden recounted his past legislative accomplishments without offering much in the way of concrete areas of bipartisan agreement going forward, which is a requirement for anything to pass a divided Congress. Never known as the world\u2019s best orator, Biden seemed to be enjoying himself. After some of his early jokes landed awkwardly, he came out of the gates at a rapid clip, doing his best to allay concerns about his age and fitness for another national campaign.

He is a former professional baseball player and the author of \u201cGOP 2.0: How the 2020 Election Can Lead to a Better Way Forward for America\u2019s Conservative Party.\u201d On Tuesday, President Joe Biden again defied expectations and delivered his State of the Union address with a combination of charm, humor and gusto centered on a clear theme: \u201cLet\u2019s finish the job.\u201d While Biden extended an olive branch to Republicans and called for bipartisan cooperation, he also sent a clear message that he is more than up for the fight against the GOP. Time and again, Biden gave as good as he got from a rowdy GOP caucus, maintaining greater control of the room in the face of heckling than Kevin McCarthy has since the 15 rounds it took for him to become House speaker. In one exchange, Biden even called out Republican members who celebrated funding for their constituents in the very infrastructure bill they voted against. Biden was fearless as he masterfully boxed Republicans into publicly opposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare, nor did he shrink from naming the horror of January 6 and the vicious consequences of the 2020 election lie and divisive political rhetoric. Biden was also fearless as he adeptly wove together the painful reality of \u201cthe talk\u201d Black parents have with their kids about how to interact with the police and humanized all sides of a renewed call for criminal justice and policing reforms rooted in core American values of trust, public safety, accountability, mutual respect and equal protection under law.

On immigration, the president urged his fellow lawmakers to \u201ccome together\u2026 and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.\u201d He cited his administration\u2019s new efforts at the border yet noted that immigration problems won\u2019t be fixed until Congress acts. He\u2019s absolutely right; at best, the president alone can make only temporary fixes to our immigration system. How telling that this common-sense section of his speech seemed to generate heckling in the House, with some members chanting, \u201cSecure the border.\u201d This illustrates the president\u2019s dilemma: Like many Americans, he supports reasonable immigration reform. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, are fixated on generating chaos and division around the issue. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and a member of the USA Today board of contributors.

But some Republicans did not return the favor. The unrulier members of the GOP yelled out multiple times during his State of the Union address, and true to form, Biden tried reasoning with them as they booed him or interjected. But the most notable moment of the night was when the new Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy visibly shushed his own conference as members yelled, \u201cSecure the border!\u201d It was a surprisingly gallant act of leadership from someone who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump, voted to overturn the 2020 election results and packed the House Oversight Committee with election deniers. But the shushing \u2014  a motion McCarthy repeated several times over the course of the speech \u2014 was also symbolic of his troubled road ahead as speaker. Will he continue to \u201cshush\u201d the extremist, conspiratorial and \u201cNever Biden\u201d wing of his party \u2014  whom he has empowered and elevated \u2014 as they act out and get in the way of his agenda, which might even include working with Biden from time to time? SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator. President Joe Biden brought receipts to the State of the Union \u2014 and I was here for every moment. Presidents almost always list noteworthy accomplishments in their speeches, but rarely do they engage with opponents in the room to double down on their points. On Tuesday, Biden did just that. His banter called for Republicans to make it clear where they stood on important issues like the debt ceiling or support for Medicaid and Social Security. Specifically, Biden claimed some Republicans were prepared to let the US default on its debt were cuts to the popular programs not included in budget negotiations \u2014 an assertion which triggered a vocal pushback from some members of the GOP caucus present. And he swiftly framed that raucous response as a consensus that wouldn\u2019t be the case; in other words, any backtracking they do on the issue is now easily labeled as bad faith flip-flopping. Some will complain his words didn\u2019t work to unify the country; I\u2019d argue we cannot be unified without speaking the truth, and Biden called that out. He spoke to his base and let them know he did not forget why he is able to stand at that podium. Whether you like it or not, this speech made it clear that Biden is running for a second term. And he seems like he is ready to fight for the American people and for every American\u2019s vote.

She is a former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama and senior aide to the Biden-Harris campaign. After making little mention of the \u201cUnity Agenda\u201d since he first announced it in his 2022 State of the Union address, President Joe Biden devoted the end of this year\u2019s speech to his plans to end cancer, support veterans, address mental health and combat the opioid epidemic. These goals, the White House is calculating, are ideal for a period when it expects Congress to pass few bills and for House Republicans to focus on investigations of Biden\u2019s family and his administration. The \u201cUnity Agenda\u201d does not represent outreach to his opponents; it is a package of uncontroversial proposals that he is daring Republicans to resist. This is consistent with the way the President has understood \u201cthe way of unity\u201d the last two years. A creature of the Senate, Biden\u2019s approach has focused on passing popular legislation most Americans will understand and appreciate, while drawing attention \u2014 and political energy \u2014 away from the divisive identity politics and culture wars that fueled the rise of Donald Trump. Just as he did Tuesday evening when he emphasized the American middle class, support for blue collar workers and \u201cbuilding bridges\u201d without mentioning sensationalized issues like critical race theory or transgender bathrooms, Biden\u2019s strategy has been to capture the center of American politics and isolate the antics of far-right leaders controlling the Republican Party. Indeed, striking this contrast has worked out politically for Democrats, who swayed independents and moderates in the 2020 and 2022 elections. But it has done little to actually unify the country. Recent polls suggest Americans are just as divided as they were before the midterms, and a solid majority expect little more than partisan gridlock from Washington the next two years.

He is the author of six books on the politics of immigration and demographic change including, most recently, \u201cMajority Minority.\u201d It\u2019s impossible not to view this State of the Union speech as a preview of President Joe Biden\u2019s soon-to-be-announced campaign for reelection. If this look at the past two years has a message for the next two, it is that Biden is in a strong position to succeed in that quest. The speech, from a man who is not known for his eloquence, was surprisingly effective. Biden was not just confident and humorous; he also made a powerful case for how successful his presidency has been on many fronts. Reducing unemployment to historic lows, restoring America\u2019s alliances, defending democracy against autocratic assaults around the world. Amazingly, Biden managed to tout his accomplishments and promote his agenda without being overly partisan. He made repeated appeals to bipartisanship, underscored the achievements made with Republican support, and when GOP members heckled him on Social Security, he managed to spar with them from the podium and, with a bit of jujitsu, appeared to secure a bipartisan agreement to leave Social Security benefits untouched. Just like he exceeded expectations during the 2020 primaries, Biden did it again with this 2023 State of the Union. We will see after a few days if the speech changed opinions across the country. But the strong speech was a good omen for his 2024 campaign. Frida Ghitis, (@fridaghitis) a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. In a scathing rebuke of President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it\u2019s time for a new generation of Republican leadership. At 40, Sanders is the youngest governor in the country. She spoke of Biden as the oldest president in American history, and at 80-years-old, she said, he is simply \u201cunfit to serve as commander in chief.\u201d The GOP response came on the heels of Republicans in the House chamber shouting their frustration with Biden\u2019s comments on the border crisis, Social Security and Medicare cuts and the threat from China. Sanders reiterated their irritation, saying \u201cBiden and the Democrats have failed you. They know it and you know it.\u201d Biden focused his speech on his administration\u2019s accomplishments on unemployment numbers, record new jobs and lower prescription drug prices. But the reality is that just because he says things are better, doesn\u2019t make it so. American people are still suffering. According to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, four in 10 Americans say they are worse off financially since Joe Biden took office. As expected, Sanders took the opportunity to go after Biden and the left\u2019s radical agenda that doesn\u2019t meet the hard realities Americans face every day. She stated Biden is \u201csurrender[ing] his presidency to a woke mob that can\u2019t even tell you what a woman is.\u201d Like it or not, Sanders spoke for many Republicans who believe that despite Biden\u2019s claim that the State of the Union is great, his failure to \u201cdefend our border, defend our skies and defend our people,\u201d puts the State of our Union in peril.

He is the author of \u201cBibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Long before the current war in Ukraine began nearly a year ago, Israel has maintained strict neutrality in the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. That may be about to change. Since he came to power at the end of 1999, Russian President Vladimir Putin has gone out of his way to court the Israeli leadership. He made sure to hold a meeting at least once a year with the serving Israeli prime minister, usually at his residences in Sochi or Moscow, and every few years he would travel to Jerusalem. A former Russian diplomat explained to me that \u201cPutin respects strength and sees Israel as a strong country with which he wants to be on good terms.\u201d The same is true of Israel\u2019s leaders, especially of Benjamin Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-serving prime minister who returned to office at the end of 2022. Netanyahu was so proud of what he claimed was a close relationship with Putin that in 2019 he used photographs of them together as part of his election campaign. He has claimed on multiple occasions that their relationship was advantageous to Israel\u2019s strategic interests. One instance of this was when Russia first deployed its military to war-torn Syria in September 2015 to prop up President Bashar Assad\u2019s blood-soaked regime. Within days, Netanyahu was in Moscow at the head of a military delegation for an unscheduled meeting with Putin. The two leaders reached an agreement whereby Israel would continue to operate in Syrian airspace but would only attack targets linked to its enemy Iran, while leaving Assad\u2019s forces untouched. A \u201cdeconfliction mechanism,\u201d including a hotline between the Russian command center in Syria and Israel\u2019s air force headquarters, was swiftly established. Opinion: Netanyahu wants peace, but offers few solutions Over the years, senior Israeli officials have been at pains to emphasize that while Israel\u2019s chief strategic ally remains the United States, it was crucial to maintain coordination with the Russians. In 2014, despite pressure from Washington, Israel refused to join the western governments in condemning Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. Strict neutrality was to be maintained throughout. When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 last year, Netanyahu was not in office. The prime minister was Naftali Bennett and he stuck to the neutrality policy. Bennett explained to me that \u201cwe are not in the same position as other countries. We have Russia just over our border in Syria. We have to take into consideration the presence of large Jewish communities in both Russia and Ukraine which could be impacted. And besides, it\u2019s useful for everyone to have a government like Israel which has good ties with both sides to serve as a go-between.\u201d In the early weeks of the war, Bennett embarked on a peace mission in which he both visited Putin in the Kremlin and had multiple conversations with Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky. He insists that \u201cthere was a 50% chance of reaching a ceasefire, sadly it failed.\u201d He also claims that his involvement helped broker short-term local truces, which allowed saving civilians from the war zone. Opinion: Don't expect Biden to confront Netanyahu anytime soon Any hope of a ceasefire has long vanished, and Ukraine has since publicly requested Israel help supply it with arms, especially with missile defense systems like the Iron Dome. Israel has sent humanitarian aid but has refused to send any weapons. In recent months, as Russia began using Iranian drones to attack Ukrainian targets, Israel has agreed to supply Kyiv, through NATO, with intelligence and technical information on how to counter the Iranian drone threat. Not everyone in the Israeli leadership agreed with Bennett\u2019s neutral policy. His political partner and then-foreign minister Yair Lapid was more forthright in publicly condemning Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Opinions were divided in the country\u2019s security establishment as well. One Israeli general told me that \u201cthe fear of Russia is overblown and Israel could have been much more supportive of Ukraine without any fear of retribution.\u201d Ten months after the Russian invasion, Netanyahu returned to office. Suddenly he was a lot less friendly toward Putin. He took one congratulatory phone call from him a week before his inauguration, but that was all. Meanwhile, in media interviews, he has said that he is reconsidering Israel\u2019s policy on the Ukraine war, though he wouldn\u2019t specify any details. One Israeli general told me that \u201cthe fear of Russia is overblown and Israel could have been much more supportive of Ukraine without any fear of retribution.\u201d Anshel Pfeffer \u201cNetanyahu has two immediate reasons for changing policy and supporting Ukraine,\u201d a former Israeli intelligence officer who was deeply involved in Israel\u2019s military relationship with Russia, told me. \u201cFirst, Russia has greatly diluted its forces in Syria as they were needed in Ukraine. The threat to Israel from them is now negligible,\u201d the officer said. \u201cSecond, Russia is now using Iranian drones and missiles on the battlefield and Israel now has a valuable opportunity to supply Ukraine with defense systems so we can see how well they do in an actual war. One day we may have to face the same Iranian weapons,\u201d the officer added. An Israeli diplomat adds another reason why Netanyahu would consider supporting Ukraine more forcefully. Unlike the Bennett-Lapid government, his new coalition of far-right and ultra-religious parties is regarded with suspicion by the Biden administration that has already voiced its displeasure with the new government\u2019s plans for a legal overhaul, which drastically weaken the powers and independence of Israel\u2019s supreme court.  Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Jerusalem, and unlike on such visits in the past, didn\u2019t extend the Prime Minister an invitation to the White House. An Israeli shift toward Kyiv could be Netanyahu\u2019s best hope of currying favor with Washington.",

Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. President Joe Biden, who has struggled for weeks to contain the fallout surrounding the discovery of classified documents at his home and former office, must have sighed with relief when former Vice President Mike Pence announced classified documents were also found at his home in Indiana. Both of these incidents come on the heels of the documents saga surrounding former President Donald Trump, who \u2013 like Biden \u2013 is now under a special counsel investigation. In August, the FBI seized more than 100 classified documents from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home during a court-approved search. News reports have emphasized the way the Biden and Pence responded differently than Trump. For one, lawyers working for Biden and Pence notified authorities shortly after the classified documents were first discovered and made an effort to return them, while Trump\u2019s team resisted efforts by the Department of Justice to retrieve all the documents at Mar-a-Lago. But, as evidenced by the latest revelations, this is not simply an inside Washington story. Nor is it one that it will go away anytime soon. While Pence\u2019s disclosure certainly takes the heat off Biden, this scandal is bad news for Biden\u2019s brand name. Opinion: Mr. President, it's time to go digital And new polling makes this clear. More than eight out of 10 Americans approve of the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the handling of classified documents found at Biden\u2019s home and office. However, according to the same CNN poll, it seems Americans understand the differences between the two cases involving Biden and Trump. While a majority of Americans disapprove of the way Biden has handled the issue and consider it a serious or \u201csomewhat serious\u201d problem, it\u2019s telling that only 37% of Americans believe he has done something illegal. Yet, when it comes to Trump\u2019s case, 52% of Americans believe he has done something illegal. Biden, who established himself as the responsible foil to Trump in 2020, has now squandered the political high ground on this issue. And with Pence thrown into the mix, Trump\u2019s team believes the latest developments could help support their argument that this should be treated as an administrative issue, rather than a criminal one. Biden also has more to lose when it comes to the issue of reputation. One of Biden\u2019s greatest assets has been his image as a regular Joe \u2013 a straight shooter who can be trusted. Like former President Jimmy Carter, who cast himself as an upstanding candidate after Watergate, Biden ran for president in 2020 as the seasoned \u201cadult in the room\u201d after the tumult of the Trump years. We\u2019re now seeing the first major blow to that image, with more attacks sure to come now that the Republicans who have gained control of the House are vowing to investigate everything from Hunter Biden to the president\u2019s border policies. Opinion: 'Saturday Night Live' sketches aside, George Santos is no joke Regardless of what House Republicans will find, if anything, they are capable of redirecting our attention to negative attacks on Biden and further damaging his reputation. If Democrats don\u2019t think these sorts of stories can have legs, they should just ask Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, which the GOP famously used to bludgeon her reputation right through the 2016 election. Biden might have a stronger reputation than Clinton, which will help. But that certainly won\u2019t insulate him from an onslaught of attacks in the next two years. The turmoil will also renew talks within the Democratic Party about whether Biden should run for reelection or who might challenge him in the primaries \u2014 two conversations that had largely abated after the party\u2019s stunning performance in the midterms. All of these controversies can easily distract both the public and the media from the issues Biden would rather focus on, such as the slowing of inflation or military support for Ukraine. And, of course, there are plenty of ways this could continue going south for Biden, especially if there are fresh revelations surrounding his handling of classified documents.  But all of this is surmountable. While there are constraints on what Biden can say in the midst of an ongoing investigation, he should be as direct with the public as possible and make every effort to turn over whatever material he has. He must also be proactive in pushing forward conversations about his domestic agenda and keeping the public eye focused on the chaos and division House Republicans are sowing. But he and his supporters shouldn\u2019t discount the significant political impact this story can have. It has already opened the door to questions about his prospects in 2024 and given a laggard Trump campaign something to crow about.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. So here we go again. Another dramatic, high-stakes debt ceiling debate is about to unfold. Not lost on the American people during these hypertension-inducing episodes is the stunning political hypocrisy revealed through debt ceiling kerfuffles. This cannot be overstated. Republican debt ceiling purists, who swore a blood oath never to raise the debt ceiling during the Obama presidency, rolled over during the Trump presidency. Take Mick Mulvaney, who as a congressman and House Freedom Caucus member stubbornly fought Speaker John Boehner on debt ceiling increases, but as Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration did a complete reversal and advocated for raising the debt ceiling, bringing along many of his recalcitrant former colleagues. As they say, where one stands depends on where one sits \u2014 and when the seats change, so do the policy positions. In fact, I vividly remember a 2017 meeting in House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office with a small cross-section of roughly 10 GOP conference members, including at least two from the Freedom Caucus. Ryan walked into the meeting and said he had just received a call from Mulvaney, now OMB director, who wanted us to vote yes on the debt ceiling. I immediately burst into laughter and quipped, \u201cOnly under one condition \u2014 Mick must come here in person and ask me to vote yes.\u201d The debt ceiling was raised without incident. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen ignited the conversation by announcing America\u2019s outstanding debt reached its statutory limit of $31.4 trillion last week. For now, Yellen will exercise her authority to implement extraordinary measures to prevent a catastrophic default, which would set off a chain of devastating events on the American economy and global financial system. The full faith and credit of the US government would be undermined if Congress fails to act in a timely manner. Unemployment would rise, and interest rates would spike. Yellen\u2019s extraordinary measures buys Congress some time but does not relieve it of the responsibility to take action. The deal McCarthy struck was an inexplicable act of self-destruction The debt ceiling battles over the past 12 years will help inform the current debate. Especially in divided government, the politics are more poisonous and battles more pitched than with one-party control of both the presidency and Congress. I sat in the room for so many of these fights that all ended, predictably and dramatically, with the debt ceiling being raised. No one with an ounce of sense could fathom crashing through this roof. Today I\u2019m considerably less confident that Congress will do what it must to prevent an unthinkable outcome. Twelve years ago, and under pressure from some firebrand members elected during the tea party wave, Boehner and then-President Barack Obama negotiated the Budget Control Act of 2011 that established a super committee charged with reforming mandatory spending as a condition to raise the debt ceiling. Naturally, the committee failed in its task, which resulted in \u201csequestration,\u201d across-the-board reductions for discretionary spending on both defense and domestic programs over 10 years, which Congress routinely waived. The drama leading up to the 2011 debt ceiling agreement rattled markets and caused a downgrade in America\u2019s credit rating by some rating agencies. After an insanely disruptive government shutdown during October 2013, the debt ceiling was raised as part of an agreement to reopen the government. In the winter of 2014, the debt ceiling was lifted again but without too much drama in anticipation of the upcoming midterm election. A frustrated and exasperated Boehner, in a closed-door meeting in his office, politely asked for House Republican volunteers to vote for a clean debt ceiling increase. I was one of fewer than 30 who dutifully responded to his request and joined Democrats to prevent yet another meaningless high-stakes drama. In 2015, the debt limit was temporarily suspended as part of yet another budget agreement. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office, 2017, the debt ceiling was raised as part of an agreement tied to emergency relief for hurricane relief. The debt ceiling debate reveals how House Republicans are weaponizing the government So what should Americans expect from the impending debt ceiling battle of 2023? Answer: a rerun of the previous battles. House Republicans will insist spending cuts be tied to any increase in the debt ceiling, while President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats will resist any negotiations. Further, House Republicans will advance legislation to prioritize debt payments to placate hard-liners in the GOP conference who have no intention of voting to increase the debt limit. This prioritization scheme, while facilitating interest payments and funding for a few other major programs, would not prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations to key constituencies and stakeholders.  There simply isn\u2019t enough money to pay everyone without raising the debt limit. The politics of debt prioritization won\u2019t pass the smell test either when creditors in China and other nations are paid but, say, Border Patrol agents or air traffic controllers are not. Danger, danger. In 2015, I was one of fewer than 10 House Republicans who voted against such a shambolic prioritization proposal that does not seriously address the underlying problem of balancing or better aligning current federal spending with existing revenues. Expectations of a negotiated settlement over the debt ceiling along the lines proposed by House Republicans seem remote. Consequently, the burden will fall upon pragmatic House Republicans such as Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Don Bacon to find a bipartisan solution. A reboot of the Simpson-Bowles fiscal reform commission could be a way for Congress to address the deficit and long-term debt in a responsible manner without risking the full faith and credit of the United States.  If, as expected, debt ceiling negotiations fail to yield an agreement by the drop-dead date established by Yellen, probably this summer, then some problem-solving House Republicans along with Democrats will likely deploy a discharge petition to force a clean debt ceiling bill out of committee and onto the House floor for a vote. As someone who was involved with the last successful discharge petition in 2015 over the Export-Import Bank reauthorization, this procedural mechanism is complex and slow-moving. The debt ceiling has been raised repeatedly over recent decades. I fully expect it will be raised once again, but not until every other alternative is rejected. Let\u2019s hope it happens before any real damage is done to America\u2019s standing and the global economy.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. The GOP bills itself as the party of law and order. But more and more, it risks becoming the party of criminality and chaos. This week, Solomon Pe\u00f1a, a Republican former candidate for the state legislature in New Mexico, was arrested as the alleged ringleader of a criminal conspiracy to shoot at the homes of several elected Democrats \u2013 motivated, police say, by election denial. The mayor of Albuquerque said an investigation confirmed \u201cthese shootings were politically motivated.\u201d  (CNN has contacted Pe\u00f1a\u2019s campaign for comment and has been unable to identify his attorney.) According to the allegations, Pe\u00f1a and four men he contacted fired shots at the homes of four Democrats, two county commissioners and two state legislators. One of them, Bernalillo County Commissioner Adriann Barboa, said she narrowly missed being in the house when bullets tore through it. \u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMy house had four shots through the front door and windows, where just hours before my grandbaby and I were playing in the living room.\u201d Luckily, no one was shot in any of these assaults. But people could have very easily been injured or killed. It\u2019s easy to imagine how conservatives might spin this in coming days: Pe\u00f1a is on the fringe, an aberration, not representative of anything. Oh, and remember the Bernie Sanders supporter who shot Rep. Steve Scalise in 2017? See, Democrats do it too! But Pe\u00f1a\u2019s involvement in an alleged criminal conspiracy in which he is accused of pulling the trigger at least once in a series of shootings at Democrats\u2019 homes is not aberrational. That he was a Republican candidate for office speaks both to the caliber of person this party is attracting and to a broader pattern of right-wing violence, fueled by the rhetoric coming from Republicans who hold some of the most powerful positions in the country. Opinion:  Trump isn't the author of the right's worsening chaos This is a GOP problem. Yes, there are many Republicans who are law-abiding and condemn political violence and the Republican Party of New Mexico issued a statement to the Associated Press saying that \u201cif Pe\u00f1a is found guilty, he must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\u201d Still, the New Mexico shootings are the entirely predictable outcome of a party that pulls in gun-obsessed conspiracy theorists divorced from reality not just as voters \u2013 which is bad enough \u2013 but as leaders while also feeding its base a steady stream of unhinged lies about its political opponents and working overtime to stop even the most basic efforts to regulate access to deadly weapons. The \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement, which culminated in mobs breaking into the Capitol building intending to overturn the results of a free and fair election, left multiple people dead, and should go down in history as one of the greatest stains on American democracy since our founding. And it is just one of many examples. In 2020, a group of far-right militia members engaged in something of a practice run for Jan. 6, when they conspired to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and overthrow the state government. (Whitmer called out then-President Trump after the plot was thwarted, saying he had \u201ccomfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division.\u201d Over a year after leaving office, Trump referred to the plot against Whitmer as a \u201cfake deal.\u201d) Those men were convicted. And hundreds of January 6 rioters have been arrested and charged as well; some are going to prison. Still, a majority of Republicans continue to believe that the 2020 election was stolen \u2013 and they believe it because it\u2019s what their leaders are telling them. And that\u2019s an inherently dangerous situation, one that carries with it the risk of violence. Right-wing terrorism has long been a more widespread problem than left-wing terrorism or Islamic extremism, and according to the ADL, most right-wing terrorism comes from anti-government extremists, who often self-identify as \u201cpatriots,\u201d or White supremacists; rounding out the right-wing terrorist triad are anti-abortion and Christian extremists. Instead of rejecting these forces, too many members of today\u2019s Republican Party play footsie with them \u2013 or flat-out embrace their rhetoric and ideas. Opinion: Why the House is incapable of dealing with George Santos Trump, the party\u2019s so-far undisputed leader and figurehead, routinely uses the same language that White supremacists and other far-right groups deploy. Just one week after announcing his bid for the presidency in 2024, he hosted Nick Fuentes, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent White nationalists and a Holocaust denier, to dine with him at Mar-a-Lago (Trump said Fuentes was there as a guest of Kanye West). And there is significant crossover between the \u201cstop the steal\u201d conspiracy, which Trump invented and then promulgated, and White nationalist and supremacist groups and individuals \u2013 Fuentes, for example, has been an enthusiastic organizer of \u201cstop the steal\u201d rallies. Fuentes was present on the grounds of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. But it\u2019s not just Trump associating with such people. Several Republicans in national office have attended and even spoken at events sponsored by Fuentes\u2019s organizations, including Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Greene has dabbled in all kinds of conspiracy theories and made a series of antisemitic and racist comments herself. In 2019, before her election to Congress, Greene suggested in a speech that then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be executed for treason. In court testimony last year, Greene said, \u201cI never mean anything for violence. All of my words never, ever, mean anything for violence.\u201d Gosar has also repeatedly aligned himself with the far-right fringe, posting a violent video of himself, in photoshopped anime, attacking President Joe Biden and appearing to kill Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Gosar\u2019s ties to White supremacist and White nationalist figures and groups go back years and years, In a statement released after the video garnered significant outrage, Gosar said he does not \u201cespouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden.\u201d When CNN\u2019s KFile reached out to Gosar\u2019s team about his many associations with racists, a spokesman declined to comment on specific questions about the congressman\u2019s \u201cassociates.\u201d Greene has said she simply \u201cstumbled across\u201d these conspiracy theories and, for the most part, doesn\u2019t believe them (the exception: she still says the 2020 election was stolen). \u201cI was allowed to believe things that weren\u2019t true,\u201d she said on the House floor in 2021. \u201cI would ask questions about them and talk about them and that is absolutely what I regret.\u201d Opinion: It's time for Marjorie Taylor Greene to go Both Greene and Gosar have been among the loudest election deniers and \u201cstop the steal\u201d proponents in the GOP. And yet both faced few consequences from their own party. After Gosar and Greene spoke at an event organized by Fuentes in February 2022, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said back then that there was no place in the Republican Party for \u201cwhite supremacists or anti-Semitism\u201d and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, now the House Speaker, said \u201cThere\u2019s no place in our party for any of this.\u201d And yet, the Republican Party leadership \u2013 and McCarthy specifically \u2013 have, in fact, made plenty of space for these same members. After Democrats stripped Gosar and Greene of their committee assignments, McCarthy promised them better ones and signaled his intent to exact retribution on Democrats. On Tuesday, the House GOP Steering Committee agreed to place Greene on the House Homeland Security Committee, which has jurisdiction over the border, and gave Gosar a seat on the House Committee on Natural Resources. Not only has McCarthy been unwilling to penalize members of his party, but he will apparently punish anyone who tries to hold them accountable. McCarthy, who has privately voiced serious concerns with the path his party is on, has nonetheless also gone out of his way to support election deniers and undermine efforts to restore American democratic norms. He was one of 147 Republicans who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election.  When people who embrace White nationalist rhetoric and all sorts of conspiracy theories emerge as your party\u2019s candidates for seats across the country, you can no longer say that these ideas and the people who hold them are all simply a vocal fringe or deny that they speak to \u2013 or for \u2013 your base. And when these ideas lead to violence again and again, it gets increasingly difficult to say that the violence is aberrational. This violence is a Republican Party problem. And the Republican Party needs to solve it \u2013 or we\u2019re going to see even more violence and bloodshed.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Republicans in Congress want to restore fiscal restraint to Washington, but it won\u2019t be easy. The difficult work of returning yearly deficits and the long-term debt to a sustainable path is complicated by the rise in interest rates and their impact on the budget, with spending on interest alone set to quadruple over the next 30 years. Disproportionate media and political attention is often paid to discretionary spending in the budget, such as expenditures on defense, some social programs or the wall at the southern border. But these policy priorities have relatively less impact on our country\u2019s long-run fiscal position than spending on major entitlement programs, particularly Medicare and Social Security. To truly return fiscal restraint to federal spending and make both programs sustainable, McCarthy and the Republicans in Congress will have to get serious about reforming them. And therein lies the challenge. The politics of entitlement reform and fiscal policy more broadly have gotten noticeably more complex (and confused) within the Republican Party since former President Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016. Opinion:  Trump isn't the author of the right's worsening chaos Trump was averse to touching entitlement spending and inspired a group of populist-minded Republicans to argue against reforms to Medicare and Social Security. All of this, of course, while Trump signed into law policies that added almost $8 trillion to deficits and saw debt held by the public exceed the size of the US economy for the first time since World War II. For their part, Democrats have largely opposed entitlement reforms over the years and effectively politicized the issue, arguing that many GOP-backed entitlement reforms would throw grandma (and grandpa) off the proverbial cliff. President Joe Biden clearly drew the battle lines when he highlighted a vow to \u201cprotect\u201d Medicare and Social Security in a January 7 statement congratulating McCarthy on his election as Speaker. Incoming GOP rep calls for new commission on entitlements But a few House Republicans, including several conservatives who initially opposed a McCarthy speakership, have explicitly supported a 2023 budget that directly addresses spending on Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs. For his part, McCarthy addressed the issue of entitlement reform in a Thursday press conference by noting that House Republicans would also \u201cprotect Medicare and Social Security\u201d but were prepared to \u201cscrutinize every single dollar spent.\u201d On this issue, McCarthy faces an early conflict in his term between politics and policy. There are unquestionable political risks to addressing popular programs like Medicare and Social Security, particularly when potential reforms or policy changes can be demagogued or characterized in an unflattering light by opponents. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a champion of entitlement reforms during his time in Congress, was relentlessly attacked for proposing even modest adjustments to the Social Security retirement age and efforts to create more choice and competition in Medicare, amongst other changes. Moreover, proposed changes to Medicare and Social Security threaten to erode Republican support amongst working-class voters, a key constituency whose votes will help McCarthy keep the speakership, as well as recapture the Senate majority and the White House in 2024. Opinion: Trump and now Biden, too? It's time to reform the classification process Politics aside, the demographic and economic realities driving the need for entitlement reform are stark. As America ages and more people rely on both Medicare and Social Security in the coming years, both programs will only increase their financial strain on federal budgets. Entitlement (or, in the language of budget wonks, \u201cmandatory\u201d) spending is responsible for over 60% of average yearly outlays over at least the next 10 years. Projected average annual spending on Social Security alone will outpace all federal discretionary spending starting in 2033. In the absence of reform, moreover, both programs face major challenges. Social Security will exhaust its retirement trust fund reserves in 10 years \u2013 a shortfall that, if unaddressed, would result in an immediate and draconian across-the-board cut in benefits. Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund, which pays inpatient health benefits, will have its reserves exhausted within the next five years, triggering provider payment cuts that could jeopardize seniors\u2019 access to care. The case for reform \u2013 and reform now \u2013 is clear, as the fiscal challenges in Medicare and Social Security only get more difficult to solve with the passage of time. Since 2016, the GOP has faced an identity crisis. The party of spending restraint and balanced budgets has been complicit in ballooning budgets and kicked the can down the road on entitlement reform in the name of political expediency.  While nothing that the House majority proposes to change Medicare or Social Security will likely become law, with Democrats in charge of the Senate and Biden as president, McCarthy and his colleagues do have a unique opportunity: They can show Americans that Republicans do have an identity rooted in fiscal responsibility, all while convincing them that reform is not only needed, but good.",

            "article_content": "Hakeem Jeffries made history as the first Black lawmaker to lead a party in Congress, addressing the 118th Congress for the first time in the early hours of Saturday morning. \u201cAs John Lewis would sometimes remind us on this floor, we may have come over on different ships but we\u2019re all in the same boat now,\u201d Jeffries said, referencing the late civil rights legend and longtime congressman. \u201cWe are White. We are Black. We are Latino. We are Asian. We are Native American. We are Christian. We are Jewish. We are Muslim. We are Hindu. We are religious. We are secular. We are gay. We are straight. We are young. We are older. We are women. We are men. We are citizens. We are dreamers,\u201d he continued. \u201cOut of many we are one. That\u2019s what makes America a great country. And no matter what kind of haters are trying to divide us, we\u2019re not going to let anyone take that away from us. Not now. Not ever.\u201d \u201cThis is the United States of America, a land of opportunity. The fact that I\u2019m able to stand up here today is another data point in that narrative.\u201d McCarthy elected House speaker after days of painstaking negotiations and failed votes The New York Democrat now leads the minority party in the US House of Representatives, succeeding Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who served as speaker in the prior session of Congress when Democrats held the majority. In addition to being the first Black lawmaker to attain such a position, he is also the first person elected to lead House Democrats to be born after the end of World War II. Jeffries\u2019 position was made official after the conclusion of a prolonged floor fight for House speaker. California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy ultimately secured the powerful position leading the GOP majority in the chamber following days of painstaking negotiations and failed votes. Jeffries told the Congress that he also wanted to \u201cmake clear\u201d that Democrats \u201cwill never compromise (their) principles.\u201d \u201cHouse Democrats,\u201d he said, \u201cwill always put American values over autocracy, benevolence over bigotry, the Constitution over the cult, democracy over demagogues, economic opportunity over extremism, freedom over facism, governing over gaslighting, hopefulness over hatred, inclusion over isolation, justice over judicial overreach, knowledge over kangaroo courts, liberty over limitation, maturity over Mar-a-Lago, normalcy over negativity, opportunity over obstruction, people over politics, quality of life issues over QAnon, reason over racism, substance over slander, triumph over tyranny, understanding over ugliness, voting rights over voter suppression, working families over the well-connected, xenial over xenophobia, \u2018yes, we can\u2019 over \u2018you can do it,\u2019 and zealous representation over zero-sum confrontation.\u201d For Democrats, Saturday officially marked the end of an era \u2013 and the start of a new one \u2013 as Jeffries, at 52, takes up his new position after Pelosi and top-ranking Democrats Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn announced they would be stepping down from their leadership positions. Clyburn is expected to become assistant leader in the new Congress. Jeffries addressed Pelosi in his remarks early Saturday, thanking the California Democrat \u201cfor all that (she has) done.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to stand on your broad shoulders,\u201d he said, \u201cas well \u2013 as well as the shoulders of the great Steny Hoyer and the great Jim Clyburn, two consequential leaders in their own right.\u201d House Democrats selected Jeffries to helm their party during a closed-door election in November. He ran unopposed, and Democrats have united around him following Pelosi\u2019s exit from leadership after two decades helming the party. Jeffries will likely be at the forefront of the House Democratic minority for the next two years with Republicans holding a slim majority in the chamber. The 118th Congress first convened on Tuesday with the House failing to elect a new speaker that day. While Republican quarrels prevented the election of a new speaker for days, ultimately going to 15 rounds of voting, Democrats displayed unwavering support for Jeffries, who consistently earned 212 votes from his party as Republicans split votes across multiple lawmakers. At one point in the early rounds of balloting, Democrats in the chamber chanted \u201cHakeem, Hakeem,\u201d while standing and clapping for their soon-to-be leader. Jeffries\u2019 lead at the time over McCarthy represented a win for Democrats on that first day with the GOP in the majority as the speakership election went to multiple rounds of balloting. \u201cWe are looking for a willing partner to solve problems for the American people, not save the Republicans from their dysfunction,\u201d Jeffries told reporters Tuesday, saying that he was not willing at that point to help Republicans elect a speaker. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Jeffries studied political science at the State University of New York at Binghamton and received a master\u2019s degree in public policy from Georgetown University. He also attended law school at New York University School of Law where he was on the law review. He started his career in politics after being elected to the New York State Assembly in 2006. In 2012, he was elected to New York\u2019s 8th congressional district, which includes parts of Brooklyn and Queens. During his time in Congress, Jeffries has pushed for policing reform, including a national ban on chokeholds following the death of Eric Garner, a Black man who died in 2014 after being held in the restraining move. He was also instrumental in the passage of the First Step Act and co-sponsored the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that passed the House but failed in the Senate. In 2019, he became chairman of the Democratic caucus, making him the youngest member serving in leadership. Jeffries was also part of a select group of lawmakers who were impeachment managers during the Senate trial of then-President Donald Trump. Jeffries, who was first elected in 2012, embarks on his sixth term with ambitions to restore the enhanced child tax credit, get his party back to the majority in 2024, call out what he describes as Republican extremism and rebuild economic access. \u201cI just look forward to the opportunity to do the most good for the greatest number of people possible for as long as I have the opportunity to do so and can operate at the highest level,\u201d he told CNN last month. Jeffries ascending to become one of the highest-ranking Black politicians ever in America comes as a record number of Black people assume their role in Congress. They will navigate the Capitol, making decisions for their constituents, in a building where the foundation was laid by slaves. This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.

The longest battle for House speaker in 164 years finally ended early Saturday, culminating with the GOP\u2019s Kevin McCarthy being elected on the 15th ballot. It should\u2019ve been the most stirring moment after days of Republican struggle on the House floor, but it wasn\u2019t. Far more memorable was the speech that followed, delivered by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries before he handed the speaker\u2019s gavel to McCarthy in a display of the peaceful transfer of power. Paying tribute to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and touting achievements of the previous Congress, Jeffries then turned to the most unforgettable part of his address, the ABCs. He began each line consecutively with the letters from A to Z, passionately defending American values of democracy and compassion over fascism and hate. But it wasn\u2019t just this use of a literary device that was so extraordinary, even though that was a big part of why the speech went viral. No, Jeffries\u2019 words were so striking because they should have been the ones the new House speaker delivered. The deal McCarthy struck was an inexplicable act of self-destruction Instead, McCarthy vowed that House Republicans\u2019 \u201cfirst bill will repeal funding for 87,000 new IRS agents.\u201d Later speaking to reporters in the halls of Congress, he praised former President Donald Trump \u2014 the man the January 6 committee\u2019s final report concluded was \u201cthe central cause\u201d of the 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Jeffries has consistently lived up to his first name, Hakeem \u2014 which  translates from Arabic into a \u201cwise\u201d or \u201clearned\u201d person seen as a fountain of deep knowledge. (The lawmaker from New York City is Baptist, but as a Muslim, I wish he were Muslim!) His speech in Saturday\u2019s early hours was the most recent example of his wisdom. The first Black leader of any major party in Congress told the House chamber, \u201cWe believe that in America our diversity is a strength, it is not a weakness.\u201d He also offered \u201cour hand of partnership\u201d to the Republicans, saying, \u201cWe extend, and intend, to try and find common ground, whenever and wherever possible on behalf of the American people.\u201d Yet Jeffries vowed that Democrats will \u201cnever compromise our principles.\u201d The newly sworn-in Democratic leader followed this pledge with the most impressive part of his speech, listing each principle literally from A to Z. The Generation X, hip-hop-quoting congressman who's taking a big step He began by making it clear Democrats reject so much that has come to define Trumpism: \u201cHouse Democrats will always put American values over autocracy, benevolence over bigotry, the Constitution over the cult, democracy over demagogues \u2026 freedom over fascism, governing over gaslighting, hopefulness over hatred. \u2026\u201d Jeers vied with applause in the House when he reached the middle of this poetic passage with a dig at Trump: \u201cmaturity over Mar-a-Lago.\u201d Jeffries continued with an alphabetical recitation of what Democrats will defend and reject: \u201cquality of life issues over QAnon, reason over racism, substance over slander, triumph over tyranny, understanding over ugliness, voting rights over voter suppression.\u201d He sent people Googling the definition of one word when he reached the letter X and said, \u201cxenial over xenophobia.\u201d (In this context, xenial means \u201cwarm, welcoming, and hospitable.\u201d) Jeffries brought this passage to a close with the line \u201czealous representation over zero-sum confrontation,\u201d shortly thereafter ending by vowing Democrats will \u201calways do the right thing by the American people.\u201d Why Kevin McCarthy may have the hardest job on Capitol Hill But these are the words McCarthy should have delivered, making it clear he denounces autocracy, fascism and the grave threats facing our democracy by Trump and the MAGA wing of the Republican Party. It\u2019s not that the House GOP leader doesn\u2019t grasp these threats. Only a week after the January 6, 2021, attack, McCarthy took to the House floor and proclaimed without any ambiguity about Trump: \u201cThe President bears responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.\u201d But fast-forward to the day after the two-year anniversary of the January 6 attack. Minutes after leaving the House, the newly elected speaker paid tribute to Trump. \u201cI do want to especially thank President Trump. I don\u2019t think you should doubt \u2014 anybody should doubt his influence,\u201d McCarthy said, adding, \u201cHe was with me from the beginning. \u2026  So, thank you, President Trump.\u201d What Kevin McCarthy's silence about George Santos reveals \u201cThank you\u201d to the man who refused to accept losing the 2020 election and whose words and actions inspired his supporters to attack the Capitol? That\u2019s not what the speaker of the House should be saying. After receiving the speaker\u2019s gavel, McCarthy did have some nice moments such as when he said to Jeffries, \u201cThere will be times we will agree and many times we will differ. I promise that our debates will be passionate, but never personal.\u201d In closing, the speaker included these commendable lines: \u201cOur nation is worth fighting for. \u2026 Our future is worth fighting for.\u201d  But these are words without meaning, given McCarthy\u2019s track record of flip-flopping on key issues such as standing up to Trump over January 6 to remaining silent over the lies by new GOP Rep. George Santos, whose vote he desperately needed in the speakership battle. In his speech, Jeffries unapologetically defended American values and our democratic republic \u2014 if only we had a speaker who had the courage to do the same.",
