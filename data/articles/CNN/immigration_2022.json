            "article_content": "Herschel Walker and his campaign are scrambling to contain the fallout from a new report alleging that the hardline anti-abortion candidate paid for his then-girlfriend to have an abortion in 2009. Republican groups are publicly vowing to spend huge money to help Walker overcome the late controversy. But Republicans are privately acknowledging the report, which Walker has vehemently denied, could be a death blow \u2013 and are trying to limit the damage to his campaign. Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise addressed staff on Tuesday morning, telling aides that the allegation that Walker had paid for an abortion was a setback this close to the election, according to a source familiar with the remarks. Paradise also alluded to the explosive \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that surfaced just weeks before the 2016 presidential election showing then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump admitting to sexually assaulting women. \u201cTrump still made it to the White House,\u201d Paradise told staff, adding that Walker\u2019s campaign had seen a surge in fundraising in the hours since Walker forcefully denied the allegations. Paradise later denied on Twitter that he referenced the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d episode saying, \u201cThis is all false (except for the part about a record fundraising day).\u201d Senior campaign officials, who spent much of Tuesday morning fielding calls from grassroots volunteers and checking in with state legislators and local GOP leaders to ensure Walker wasn\u2019t losing support, planned to conduct a frank conversation about the abortion allegation with their boss on Tuesday, said a person close to the Walker campaign. The identity of the woman making the claim was withheld by the Daily Beast, which first reported the allegation against Walker. CNN has not independently confirmed the allegation. \u201cOnce we have more of the facts, we can go about our jobs and go win this thing,\u201d said the person close to the Walker campaign. Walker has been able to weather one controversy after another, staying neck-and-neck with Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in one of the most hotly contested Senate races this cycle. But with five weeks before Election Day, the Daily Beast report prompted Walker\u2019s son, Christian, to attack Walker as a liar and left conservatives wondering whether his alleged hypocrisy would sink his Senate campaign. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a few days to assess how this turns out,\u201d said one senior GOP strategist who asked not to be named. After initially agreeing to divulge to CNN where he was campaigning this week, his aides declined to answer questions or disclose anything about his schedule. But CNN obtained a copy of an invite to a Tuesday event sponsored by \u201cPrayer Warriors for Herschel\u201d at a Baptist church in Atlanta suburbs, where Walker refused to be interviewed by the media. CNN was not allowed to cover the event or stay in the parking lot. Conservative activist Ralph Reed told reporters outside the event that the article is \u201cunlikely to resonate with voters in Georgia. It\u2019s based on an anonymous allegation that is 13 years old.\u201d He went on to pivot to an attack on Warnock\u2019s record and the senator\u2019s votes with President Joe Biden. Asked if Walker could address these matters himself, Reed told CNN: \u201cThis is a closed event. It\u2019s a prayer event with faith leaders.\u201d Walker called the claim \u201ca flat-out lie\u201d and threatened on \u200bTuesday morning to sue the Daily Beast. The Daily Beast said it corroborated the allegations with a receipt from the abortion clinic, a bank deposit receipt and a \u201cget well\u201d card from Walker, and provided by the woman, as well as an interview with a \u201cclose friend\u201d of the woman. \u201cI deny this in the strongest possible terms,\u201d Walker said in a statement. Christian Walker, one of his sons, decried his father on Twitter following the report, saying Herschel Walker is not a \u201cfamily man,\u201d and was lying to the public. It's been a very bad 24 hours for Herschel Walker Herschel Walker replied on Twitter, \u201cI LOVE my son, no matter what.\u201d Christian Walker, a conservative social media influencer, then tweeted that his father \u201cbetrayed\u201d their family. Asked to respond to Christian Walker, Reed said, \u201cI gave my statement.\u201d But with the battle for control of the Senate on a knife\u2019s edge, Republicans are signaling they\u2019re not backing away from Walker, who could put them back in the majority with a victory in the battleground state. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republican campaign arm, and the Senate Leadership Fund, a Super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, reiterated their commitment to electing Walker. NRSC Chairman Rick Scott, a Florida senator, was scheduled to privately speak with Walker by phone Tuesday morning, according to a person familiar with the matter, and NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline publicly pushed back after the report. \u201cDemocrats are losing in Georgia and are on the verge of losing the majority, so they and their media allies are doing what they always do - attack Republicans with innuendo and lies,\u201d Hartline said. \u201cWe are full speed ahead in Georgia. This election is about the future of the country - Herschel Walker will make things better, Raphael Warnock is making it worse,\u201d added SLF president Steven Law in a statement. \u201cAnything else is a distraction.\u201d Trump also came to Walker\u2019s defense, saying in a statement Tuesday that he had \u201cproperly denied the charges against him, and I have no doubt he is correct.\u201d Trump, who claimed that Walker was being \u201cslandered and maligned,\u201d was pleased to see SLF and NRSC stand by Walker, who he hand-picked for the Senate contest, said an adviser to the former President. Sources close to the former President, however, said that Trump\u2019s team is bracing for further allegations against Walker to emerge before Election Day and currently weighing whether Trump should return to Georgia to campaign for Walker. Conservative activists in Georgia wage campaign to purge voter rolls ahead of November's election \u201cThe President has been to Georgia twice in the past year and the state was in a good spot until yesterday \u2013 so now we have to see how the ground shifts,\u201d said a second Trump adviser. Sources said the decision over whether Trump returns to the state likely won\u2019t come until after an October 14 debate between Walker and Warnock in Savannah. The Daily Beast report takes on heightened significance after a conservative majority on the Supreme Court stripped away the constitutional right to an abortion, voting this summer to overturn the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade. In May, Walker said there are \u201cno exceptions in my mind\u201d that should be made for an abortion. And in September, he announced his support for a proposed national ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. After the Supreme Court ruling, Democrats have tried to rally the public to vote for them to protect abortion rights. Senate Majority PAC\u2019s affiliated group, Georgia Honor, will launch a TV ad on Wednesday \u201chighlighting how Herschel Walker supports a complete ban on abortion without any exceptions,\u201d according to a spokesperson. At an event with Jewish activists on Monday night outside of Atlanta, Warnock, the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, got a standing ovation in describing his position. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith and as a man of faith, I have a profound reverence for life, and I have a deep and abiding respect for choice,\u201d said Warnock. \u201cI believe that a patient\u2019s room is too small and cramped a space for a woman, her doctor, and the United States government. That\u2019s just too many people in the room. Too many people in the room.\u201d Before the event, Susan Segal, a Georgia resident, said she would support Warnock, calling \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d and abortion \u201ca driving issue\u201d for her. \u201cI think it\u2019s very much a story that we\u2019re being asked to go back to 1940. And I think that\u2019s a very frightening direction to go,\u201d Segal said. Herschel Walker's bizarre move to lower expectations Some Georgia Democrats are staying silent on the latest Walker allegation; the state party said they would not be commenting on the Daily Beast article. One Democratic organizer in the state is skeptical of the long-term impact of the revelations. \u201cWe saw in 2016, Donald Trump being vulgar and bragging about sexually abusing women. And he still became the President of the United States,\u201d said Hillary Holley, Executive Director of the Care in Action PAC, who previously worked for the Stacey Abrams campaign in 2018. After Trump urged him to run, Walker, a former running back star at the University of Georgia and NFL, earned the support of Republican party leaders like McConnell, who was privately reluctant to back Walker at first and searched for other candidates. Public polls between Walker and Warnock now show the race to be extremely close, as the midterm political environment for Democrats across the country remains poor due to President Joe Biden\u2019s unpopularity, inflation and crime. So far, Walker has been able to withstand a series of stories about his character, business practices and personal life, including the alleged violent threats he\u2019s made to a number of women, including his ex-wife. Walker has said he has dissociative identity disorder, which was previously known as multiple personality disorder, and has sought to advise people with mental health problems. Warnock and allied outside groups have been hammering Walker on the airwaves for weeks, highlighting the allegations of domestic abuse in multi-millions dollar advertising campaigns. Asked if he had seen ads going after Walker\u2019s past, Greg Baker, a Georgia resident who plans to vote for Warnock, said, \u201cHow could you not?\u201d Warnock and Walker agree to at least one debate in marquee Senate race in Georgia Warnock defended his campaign\u2019s focus on the issue despite Walker acknowledging his past struggle with mental health. \u201cI think that the people of Georgia have a stark choice to make about who they think is ready to represent them in the United States Senate,\u201d Warnock told CNN. Last week, asked about Walker\u2019s alleged violent comments toward women, Scott told CNN, \u201cHerschel has been honest about his past, and he\u2019s been honest about how he got help and he\u2019s better.\u201d Scott said voters would be focused on the rising costs of consumer goods, the US-Mexico border, the fallout from the US evacuation from Afghanistan and critical race theory. David Gould, a Georgia resident, told CNN he would vote for Walker because of \u201ceconomic issues,\u201d including the lack of \u201caccountability\u201d over federal government spending, taxes, immigration and defense. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with Warnock\u2019s philosophy,\u201d Gould said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the votes he\u2019s taken since he\u2019s been in office.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes, Eva McKend, Morgan Rimmer and Michael Warren contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and Democratic challenger Beto O\u2019Rourke clashed over gun restrictions in a debate Friday night, with O\u2019Rourke claiming that Abbott blames \u201ceverybody else\u201d for mass shootings while \u201cmisleading this state.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been 18 weeks since their kids have been killed, and not a thing has changed in this state to make it any less likely that any other child will meet the same fate,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in their debate at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Edinburg. \u201cAll we need is action, and the only person standing in our way is the governor of the state of Texas.\u201d Abbott was shown a video of a child in Uvalde asking why Texas will not raise the age minimum to buy assault-style rifles. He said he believes such a move would be \u201cunconstitutional\u201d under recent court rulings. \u201cWe want to end school shootings, but we cannot do that by making false promises,\u201d Abbott said. Abbott also said he opposed \u201cred flag\u201d laws, saying that those laws \u201cwould deny lawful Texas gun owners their right to due process.\u201d O\u2019Rourke, meanwhile, did not back away from comments that he made as a 2020 presidential candidate, in the wake of the racially motivated mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart in 2019, that he would seek to confiscate assault-style rifles such as AR-15s and AK-47s. But he said as governor, he would be \u201cfocused on what we can get done.\u201d He said that would include raising the age minimum to purchase such firearms to 21, implementing universal background checks and enacting \u201cred flag\u201d laws. \u201cThis is the common ground,\u201d he said, citing conversations with Republican and Democratic voters, as well as families of those slain in Uvalde. Friday night\u2019s showdown was the only scheduled debate between Abbott, the Republican seeking a third term as governor, and O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic former El Paso congressman whose near-miss in a 2018 race against Sen. Ted Cruz electrified Texas Democrats. Democrats have not won a gubernatorial race in Texas since Ann Richards was elected governor in 1990. The party also hasn\u2019t won a statewide race in the Lone Star State since 1994 \u2014 Democrats\u2019 longest statewide losing streak in the country. Abbott, who is viewed as a potential 2024 presidential contender, has consistently led in the polls. A Quinnipiac University survey conducted September 22-26 found the governor with a 7-point edge over O\u2019Rourke among likely voters, 53% to 46%. The most recent campaign finance reports in mid-July showed O\u2019Rourke keeping pace with Abbott\u2019s fundraising, but the incumbent maintained a significant cash-on-hand edge with $46 million in the bank to his challenger\u2019s $24 million. On the campaign trail, O\u2019Rourke has criticized Abbott\u2019s opposition to abortion rights \u2013 the governor signed a so-called trigger law last year that went into effect in August and bans nearly all abortions in the state following the US Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Democrat has also criticized the Abbott administration\u2019s management of the power grid during last year\u2019s winter freeze and the governor\u2019s rejection of gun restrictions in the wake of the Uvalde school shooting. O\u2019Rourke famously confronted Abbott and other officials at a news conference in Uvalde  the day after the shooting, saying, \u201cThe time to stop the next shooting is right now and you are doing nothing.\u201d Abbott, meanwhile, has campaigned on tough border security policies, including busing migrants out of state to Democratic-run cities up North to protest the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies. He has also accused O\u2019Rourke of seeking to undercut police funding, saying in an ad that O\u2019Rourke wants to \u201cdefund and dismantle the police.\u201d It was a reference to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments in 2020, in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, praising protesters for targeting \u201cline items that have over militarized our police.\u201d O\u2019Rourke has said he does not support cutting funding for police in Texas. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t think Greg Abbott wakes up wanting to see children shot in their schools or for the grid to fail, but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s incapable or unwilling to make the changes necessary to prioritize the lives of our fellow Texans. That\u2019s why it\u2019s on all of us to make change at the ballot box,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in his closing remarks. In his closing, Abbott said: \u201cI\u2019m running for reelection to keep Texas No. 1 \u2014 to cut your property taxes, to secure the border, to keep dangerous criminals behind bars, and to keep deadly fentanyl off our streets.\u201d The two also sharply diverged on abortion rights, an issue that has moved to the center of the gubernatorial race after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Abbott signed into law a measure that restricts abortion except to save the life of the mother and in certain health emergencies. O\u2019Rourke said he would seek to return Texas to the abortion protections that existed under Roe v. Wade. \u201cThis election is about reproductive freedom. If you care about this, you need to turn out and vote,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI will fight to make sure that every woman in Texas can make her own decision about her own body, her own future, and her own health care.\u201d Abbott said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position on abortion is \u201cthe most extreme,\u201d casting O\u2019Rourke as supporting the right to abortions up until birth. \u201cNo one thinks that in the state of Texas,\u201d O\u2019Rourke shot back. \u201cHe\u2019s saying this because he signed the most extreme abortion ban in America: No exception for rape, no exception for incest, it begins at conception, and it\u2019s taking place in a state that is at the epicenter of a maternal mortality crisis, thanks to Greg Abbott \u2014 three times as deadly for Black women.\u201d Abbott was asked whether emergency contraception is a viable alternative for victims of rape and incest. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon the state of Texas to make sure that it is readily available,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those who are victims of sexual assault or survivors of sexual assault, the state of Texas pays for that, whether it be at a hospital, at a clinic, or someone that gets a prescription because of it.\u201d He also touted the state\u2019s \u201calternative to abortion program,\u201d including living assistance and baby supplies, for those victims. Abbott touted reforms to the power grid after the deep freeze, pointing to record high temperatures this summer. \u201cTime and again, the power grid was able to keep up, and it\u2019s because of the reforms that we were able to make. The power grid remains more resilient \u2026 than ever before,\u201d he said. But O\u2019Rourke said the power failure was \u201cpart of a pattern\u201d during Abbott\u2019s almost eight years in office, and that the governor had been warned about the possibility. \u201cThe grid is still not fixed,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, pointing to higher energy bills, Toyota stopping its third shift in San Antonio \u201cbecause it was drawing too much power,\u201d and Texas residents receiving conservation notices over the summer. \u201cAll Beto does is fear-monger on this issue, when in reality, the grid is more resilient and more reliable than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Abbott responded.",

            "article_content": "Despite disavowing White nationalism last spring when one of its adherents endorsed him, a US House candidate in Washington subsequently gave a previously unreported interview in June to a Nazi sympathizer and White nationalist. While Republican Joe Kent touted his support for prominent far-right figures like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green and Paul Gosar and supported MAGA policies, he was speaking with Greyson Arnold, a Nazi sympathizer. Kent\u2019s exchange with Arnold is all the more notable because just weeks later Kent\u2019s campaign worked to distance him from Arnold after photos surfaced of the pair together. A Kent campaign strategist told the Associated Press in July that the campaign did not do background checks on those who took selfies with the candidate. Arnold has a well-documented history of making White nationalist, racist, antisemitic and pro-Nazi statements, including once calling Adolf Hitler \u201ca complicated historical figure which many people misunderstand.\u201d In a statement to CNN, campaign spokesperson Matt Braynard said, \u201cJoe Kent had no idea who that individual was when he encountered him on the street and Joe Kent has repeatedly condemned the statements that the individual is accused of making.\u201d Braynard added that the campaign screens all interview requests and that Arnold approached Kent on the street by what he assumed was a local journalist. \u201cNone of the questions gave Joe any indications that the individual had any racist or antisemitic views and, if he had, Joe would have cancelled the interview immediately,\u201d said Braynard. The campaign said that Arnold \u201cis not in any way part of our campaign nor would we allow our campaign to be associated with someone who has that background. We also have no record of any contribution from that individual and if we had received one, we\u2019d return it.\u201d Kent, a former Green Beret and gold star spouse endorsed by former President Donald Trump, ran in this summer\u2019s primary against Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, one of ten Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021. In August, Kent advanced to November\u2019s general election against Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez under the state\u2019s top-two primary system after edging out Beutler, who placed third. Inside Elections recently redesignated the race as more competitive, moving it from \u201cSafe Republican\u201d to \u201cLikely Republican.\u201d On a since-suspended Twitter account and active channel on Telegram called \u201cPure Politics,\u201d Greyson, or \u201cAmerican Greyson\u201d as he calls himself, has shared posts that called Nazi men the \u201cpure race\u201d and that the US should have sided with the Nazis during World War Two. Arnold has falsely claimed there were \u201cJewish plans to genocide the German people,\u201d and in a post, he shared a quote that said the \u201cJewish led colored hordes of the Earth\u201d were attempting to exterminate White people. Arnold was pictured in multiple photographs with Kent at a fundraiser in April and has been canvassing for Republican candidates with Washington State Young Republicans, with one recent photo showing Arnold in a Joe Kent shirt according to photos on their public Instagram. Speaking with Arnold, Kent praised Gosar\u2019s stance on illegal and legal immigration in a friendly five-minute interview. \u201cPaul Gosar has been excellent, obviously immigration \u2013 border state down there. He took me down to the border, so I got a firsthand feel of all the crises we face there,\u201d said Kent. \u201cRepresentative Gosar also has some awesome legislation he\u2019s proposed about getting rid of a lot of the legal immigration.\u201d Arnold was at the Capitol during the January 6, 2021, riot, posting a video of himself leaving the steps of the front of the building saying they were being \u201cchased out by communists,\u201d calling the riot \u201can American baptism,\u201d as he said police were deploying tear gas. There is no indication he entered the building, and he has not been charged with any crime. While Kent has tried to shift his campaign rhetoric toward the center \u2013 including by removing calls to adjudicate the 2020 election from his website sometime between June and July \u2013 his campaign has been bogged down by associations with white nationalists and extremists, whom Kent has repeatedly had to distance himself from. Back in March 2022, Kent disavowed Nick Fuentes, a 24-year-old far-right white nationalist, after Fuentes endorsed Kent in the primary. Fuentes is the architect of the America First Political Action Conference, a white nationalist conference held annually that received intense backlash this year after Gosar appeared at the event and Greene attended it. Kent said at the time that he was unfamiliar with Fuentes despite a brief call with him in spring 2021 about the candidate\u2019s social media strategy. In April 2021, Kent tweeted in defense of Fuentes after he was banned from Twitter. \u201cMany are glad that their political rivals are targeted by the state & big tech, they hate Trump, @NickJFuentes & MAGA. This short side thinking has led to some of the greatest tragedies in human history. We must fight for all speech & fight the confluence of gov & big tech.\u201d He later said he stood by his comments but reiterated he did not want Fuentes\u2019 endorsement because of Fuentes\u2019 \u201cfocus on race/religion.\u201d Kent\u2019s website also features an endorsement from Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers who was censured by the Republican-controlled Arizona senate after she gave a speech to the white nationalist conference calling for public hangings.",

            "article_content": "While more Latinos say Democrats work hard to earn their votes than Republicans, about half of them don\u2019t see a \u201cgreat deal of difference\u201d in what the two political parties stand for, a new poll shows. A Pew Research Center survey, published Thursday, analyzes Latinos\u2019 political views and the issues they consider of most importance in the midterm elections. The survey was conducted in August among a randomly selected sample of 3,029 Latino adults, the center said. Overall, 71% of Latino respondents said the statement that the Democratic Party \u201cworks hard to earn\u201d Latinos\u2019 votes describes their views at least somewhat well, compared to 45% of Latinos who said the same about the GOP, the survey found. A significant share \u2013 between 42% and 48% \u2013 of Latinos in certain groups said the statement \u201cDemocrats work hard to earn Latinos\u2019 votes\u201d described their views very or extremely well. Those groups were immigrants, Spanish-dominant Latinos, Catholics, and evangelical Protestants as well as Latinos ages 50 to 64, and ages 65 or older, the survey shows. Most Latinos, the survey shows, have a positive assessment of Democrats, but about a third of respondents said they don\u2019t believe the Democratic party represents their interests or really cares about Latinos. When asked for their opinion about Republicans, 63% of respondents said they do not believe the GOP really cares about Latinos, the survey said. Researchers also analyzed the respondents\u2019 family origins and found that those who identify as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Central American and South American were more likely to say that Democrats represent their interests well than to say the same of Republicans. Meanwhile, Cubans were split on their assessment of Democrats and Republicans. Since the 2020 election, the idea of a rising number of Latino Republican voters has dominated headlines and the victory of Republican Mayra Flores in the special election for Texas\u2019 34th Congressional District in June brought renewed attention to the issue. But the survey shows the party affiliation of Latinos has not significantly changed in recent years, said Jens Manuel Krogstad, a senior writer and editor at the Pew Research Center and lead author of the report. About 64% of Latino registered voters said they identified with or lean toward the Democratic Party and 33% identified with the Republican Party. Researchers said previous Pew Research studies showed the party affiliation of Latinos has remained steady since at least 2019. Data from the survey shows Latinos may not be completely out of the GOP\u2019s reach. Krogstad said Latinos \u201cfit imperfectly into the nation\u2019s polarized two-party system\u201d and they \u201care charting their own course in some ways.\u201d About half of Latinos do not think there\u2019s a \u201cgreat deal of difference\u201d in what the Democratic and Republican parties stand for. Those with a high school education or less are more likely than those with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree to say that there\u2019s hardly any difference at all between parties, researchers said. For the most part Latinos have positive views about the political party they are affiliated with but some expressed favorable views of the opposing party. About a third of Latino Republicans said it described their beliefs \u201cat least somewhat well\u201d to say that Democrats really care about Latinos. About 21% of Latino Democrats said the same about the GOP, according to the survey. Latinos who took part in the survey discussed their views on the midterm elections. Among those who said they were registered voters, only 30% said they have given \u201ca lot of thought\u201d to the election. About half of Latino registered voters said they would vote for or are leaning toward a Democratic candidate and 28% said they would vote for a Republican candidate. But about 18% said they would vote for another candidate or were not sure who they would vote for, the survey shows. Latino registered voters identified several issues they consider as important when making a voting decision but the economy is a top issue. At least 80% of respondents in this group said it is \u201cvery important,\u201d according to the survey. That includes 90% of Latino Republicans and 75% Latino Democrats. Most Latinos identified health care, education and violent crime as other important issues for them, but abortion and gun policy would play an important role in Latino voting decisions, the survey said. The report\u2019s authors said abortion has risen in importance \u2013 from 42% to 57% \u2013 among Latinos who are registered to vote. The change is largely driven by Latino Democrats, the survey shows. When asked about their voting decisions, most Latino registered voters said they would probably or definitely not vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on abortion and gun policy even if the candidate agrees with them on most other issues.  Sixty-one percent of Latinos registered to vote said the same about immigration and the economy, the survey said. A 57% majority of Latinos said abortion should be legal in at least some cases and 73% of Latinos said it is more important to control gun ownership than protect the right of Americans to own guns, according to the survey. Pew Research surveyed 3,029 US Latino adults from August 1-14, using a nationally representative online panel. Results for the full sample of Latino respondents have a margin of sampling error of +/- 2.7 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Gov. Ron DeSantis has already faced unprecedented challenges during his first term, including a two-year pandemic and a vexing environmental catastrophe. He\u2019s now priming for a more traditional but no less daunting test of Florida leaders: a hurricane. Hurricane Ian, a 500-mile wide storm building strength in the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to blast into Florida\u2019s west coast Wednesday, carrying with it a potentially deadly combination of wind, rain and storm surge. If the state\u2019s painful history with Mother Nature is any indication, the recovery from Ian will be measured in months, hundreds of millions of dollars and untold heartache. DeSantis on Wednesday morning warned the highest risk is from Collier County up to Sarasota County, with landfall expected in Charlotte County. \u201cIf you are in any of those counties, it\u2019s no longer possible to safely evacuate. It\u2019s time to hunker down and prepare for this storm. This is a powerful storm that should be treated like you would treat\u201d a tornado approaching your home, he said. How DeSantis, a national figure in the Republican Party with presidential aspirations, responds to the crisis will be closely watched. He faces reelection in six weeks, and besides testing his administration\u2019s readiness, Hurricane Ian threatens to further expose a looming property insurance crisis in the state that his Democratic opponent, Charlie Crist, had already made into a campaign issue long before Ian formed. The storm also arrives at an especially fraught moment in the Republican\u2019s caustic relationship with the Democratic White House. It was just days ago that President Joe Biden angrily scorned DeSantis for sending migrants from the border to Martha\u2019s Vineyard as \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201creckless.\u201d DeSantis shot back that Biden\u2019s immigration policies were causing \u201chuge damage to our country.\u201d Still, Biden spoke Tuesday evening with DeSantis, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, and they \u201ccommitted to continued close coordination,\u201d she said in a tweet. Both DeSantis and Biden have insisted that their respective governments are collaborating as planned in the days leading up to Ian\u2019s arrival. DeSantis said he is already working closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Biden told reporters Tuesday his administration was \u201con alert and in action to help the people of Florida.\u201d Biden had reached out to the Tampa Bay area\u2019s three mayors earlier Tuesday as forecasts at the time predicted the region would bear the brunt of the storm. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor stepped away from a news conference Tuesday to answer the President\u2019s call. \u201cHe just wanted to ensure that we had all the resources we needed, and clearly just wishing us the best,\u201d Castor told reporters after hanging up with the White House. At a news briefing Tuesday afternoon ahead of his conversation with Biden, DeSantis had said, \u201cMy phone is open,\u201d and he is \u201chappy to brief the president if he\u2019s interested in hearing what we\u2019re doing in Florida.\u201d Hurricanes in Florida have the potential to create defining moments for Florida\u2019s leaders. It took almost two years for Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles\u2019 political standing to recover from the state\u2019s slow response to the devastation to South Florida caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Republican Gov. Jeb Bush managed Florida through a handful of damaging hurricanes over 14 months from 2004 to 2005, including Charley and Katrina, and it earned him a reputation as an unflappable and deliberate executive. When then-Republican Gov. Rick Scott changed out of his executive boardroom suit and into his blue Navy baseball hat, Florida residents took it as a sign to get ready for a weather event. DeSantis knows better than most how storms can affect the political winds in Florida. He was elected in 2018 just days after the arrival of Hurricane Michael, a sudden and powerful storm that ripped through the Panhandle that October and killed at least 16 people across a handful of states while nearly eliminating the town of Mexico Beach. Some parts of northern Florida had trouble regaining electricity, let alone opening polling locations. How Trump and DeSantis are already splitting the conservative movement \u201cEveryone asks, \u2018How do you think they\u2019re doing?\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter what I think, it matters what the public thinks,\u201d said Craig Fugate, who was Florida\u2019s director of emergency management under Bush. \u201cIs there something that gets attributed to him, that gets blamed on his response? There will be noise in the system, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll blame the governor. It\u2019ll be based on how he is perceived, the leadership role, his presence.\u201d DeSantis has responded by putting politics on the back burner, at least for now. His news conferences \u2013 the regularly scheduled episodes of political theater that have produced viral moments like his combative exchange with a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d reporter over vaccine distribution and his public admonishing of students for wearing masks \u2013 have centered exclusively on preparing Floridians for the storm. He has taken the expected procedural steps \u2013 declaring a state of emergency, mobilizing the Florida National Guard, and readying the Emergency Operations Center. \u201cMy view on all this is like you\u2019ve got people\u2019s lives at stake, you\u2019ve got their property at stake and we don\u2019t have time for pettiness,\u201d DeSantis said Tuesday evening. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta work together to make sure we\u2019re doing the best job for them.\u201d Crist, DeSantis\u2019 opponent, has pulled his ads off the airwaves in most of the state\u2019s television markets and has returned to his home in Pinellas County, where the storm is expected to have considerable impact. DeSantis\u2019 campaign did not respond to a question about the storm\u2019s impact on DeSantis\u2019 political activity. An abrasive political style is what has endeared DeSantis to Republican voters across the country amid his ascent within his party, but it has also resulted in strained relationships with the same local and national leaders DeSantis must now collaborate with to get Florida through this storm. After initially ceding coronavirus action to city mayors and county officials, DeSantis made a hard pivot and stripped municipalities of their ability to manage the pandemic while encouraging residents to ignore local precautions on masks and other mitigation measures. This week, though, DeSantis urged Tampa Bay residents to follow the advice of local leaders and lauded county emergency management teams as experienced professionals. \u201cIf you\u2019re asked to evacuate, heed those warnings,\u201d DeSantis said during a news conference Monday in Largo. \u201cIf you don\u2019t heed those warnings, you could regret that.\u201d DeSantis has repeatedly suggested Biden\u2019s disdain for the Republican leader has affected bureaucratic decisions, like whether to give the state access to certain coronavirus remedies. Earlier this year, he accused Biden of denying FEMA assistance to some Floridians on the west coast impacted by spring tornadoes out of spite. \u201cTo deny tornado victims just because of politics is wrong,\u201d DeSantis said in March, without presenting evidence to support his theory. But with Ian headed toward Florida, DeSantis issued the rare compliment of the White House after Biden declared a state of emergency for the state. \u201cThey stand by ready to help, so we appreciate that quick action,\u201d DeSantis said on Saturday. Rick Kriseman, who was mayor of St. Petersburg until last year, said DeSantis\u2019 past actions have made it more difficult for everyone to work together. \u201cYou have to hope that it doesn\u2019t negatively impact the quality of the response,\u201d Kriseman said. \u201cI do believe because it\u2019s an election year for him that the response will be different.\u201d Kriseman said Scott as governor called early and often during a crisis, even though the two were from different parties. Though they overlapped for three years, Kriseman said DeSantis didn\u2019t call once, even as his coronavirus orders regularly left communities confused and desperate for answers. Adam Smith, a spokesman for Castor, said DeSantis has not called the Tampa mayor. Scott, however, did reach out to her, Smith said. \u201cWhat Scott did, what Charlie Crist did, was pick up the phone, call the community and mayors at risk and you reassure them,\u201d Kriseman said. \u201cThat call goes a long way. Being the first voice that a community leader hear makes it easier and it works better.\u201d Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who served as DeSantis\u2019 director of emergency management before leaving to run for US House, said that it\u2019s a difference in style that had no bearing on the outcome of the state\u2019s response. \u201cAs long as the mayors are talking to the (Division of Emergency Management), who is in charge of responding to the storm, it\u2019s a distinction without a difference,\u201d Moskowitz said. Smith confirmed Castor has talked with DeSantis\u2019 current DEM secretary, Kevin Guthrie. \u201cGovernors might have different styles, but what is the end result?\u201d Moskowitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s what is important.\u201d CNN\u2019s Melissa Alonso contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "A deepening rivalry between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis is beginning to spark a debate among conservatives over the unofficial coronation of the Florida governor as the party\u2019s most promising non-Trump option in 2024, with some prominent intellectuals and activists urging DeSantis superfans to pump the brakes. Questions of whether the former President \u2013 with his cult-like following and inimitable breed of politics \u2013 is the only logical choice or a candidate past his prime have consumed conservative donors, organizers and intellectuals as the GOP presidential primary approaches and DeSantis\u2019 stock continues to rise.   The Florida governor has dominated headlines after arranging for an estimated 50 migrants to be flown to Martha\u2019s Vineyard in protest of the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policies and though the flagrantly political move drew widespread condemnation, it was equally celebrated among Trump supporters and the GOP base. \u201cThe Trump vs. DeSantis conflict comes up daily in our office,\u201d said Terry Schilling, executive director of the socially conservative American Principles Project. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult decision.\u201d For months now, conservatives have been quietly debating the merits of Trump vs. DeSantis, asking themselves if Trump, who remains caught in a web of legal troubles, is too damaged or polarizing to return the White House to Republicans and effectively implement the changes many conservatives seek. Or if DeSantis, with his \u201canti-woke\u201d crusade and surging popularity, is a superior alternative to the 45th President or a political chameleon \u2013 someone who might creep toward the center in a general election. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say that Trump was John the Baptist paving the way for Jesus,\u201d said a senior official at another prominent conservative organization. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard concerns that DeSantis is a really smart operator who read the tea leaves and slid into this position at the right time, so he can\u2019t necessarily be trusted.\u201d Few other Republicans have drawn as many side-by-side comparisons to Trump as DeSantis, who is running for reelection as governor and has lately set himself apart from other rumored 2024 GOP hopefuls by diving headfirst into the third rail of American politics with provocative moves on immigration, big business, coronavirus, and education. DeSantis privately elevates election deniers while publicly staying mum on 2020 Trump has privately griped to aides that he made the Florida governor a star when he endorsed his gubernatorial bid in 2018, and regularly sends out statements through his leadership PAC seeking to flaunt his strength against DeSantis in a hypothetical matchup. One adviser to the former President said Trump is \u201cclearly feeling threatened.\u201d Even fundraising emails by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP campaign arm responsible for flipping the chamber, have begun to frame the 2024 primary as a binary choice, asking donors to \u201cvote Trump\u201d or \u201cvote DeSantis\u201d in recent email solicitations. \u201cWe are lucky to have so many great Conservative leaders fighting for us like President Trump and Governor DeSantis,\u201d one such email read. And before delivering a keynote speech at the National Conservatism Conference this month, where other rising conservative figures like tech mogul Peter Thiel and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley spoke to attendees, DeSantis was introduced as \u201cthe future President of the United States.\u201d Concerned that conservatives may be jumping the gun, two influential conservative writers penned an unusually early endorsement on Tuesday of re-nominating Trump in 2024 \u2013 the first entry in what is likely to become a fraught intra-party debate if both the former President and Florida governor launch White House campaigns. GOP leaders still strive to appease Trump's base on election denialism Warning that the conservative movement is preparing \u201cto rally around an alternative to Trump,\u201d Sohrab Ahmari and Matthew Schmitz of the online magazine Compact made their case for why the 45th President \u2013 despite \u201call his failings\u201d \u2013 should be the next Republican Party nominee for president. \u201cAmerica\u2019s problems haven\u2019t been caused by irresponsible populists but by a rapacious and feckless establishment. Donald Trump\u2026 is the only candidate who recognizes this fact,\u201d they write in a new op-ed. \u201cHe alone has broken with the conservative movement\u2019s unquestioning support for foreign wars and the security state. He alone has challenged the right\u2019s economic pieties. He alone offers Americans a chance to confront and chasten their failed elites.\u201d The duo\u2019s Trump endorsement, published in conjunction with another writer\u2019s endorsement in the same magazine of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination, makes the case that Trump is the lone Republican capable of dismantling the conservative movement as it is currently known and building something better in its place. Some conservative say the noticeable interest in DeSantis as a pro-Trump alternative is due, in part, to his willingness to be even Trumpier than the former President himself \u2013 his recent migrant flights serving as a prime example. The move, which is said to have irritated the former President, drew a thinly veiled rebuke by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who told Fox News immediately following the stunt, \u201cWe have to remember that these are human beings.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re people, so seeing them being used as political pawns one way or the other is very troubling to me,\u201d Kushner said. DeSantis gets standing ovation from GOP voters after flying migrants to Martha's Vineyard As governor during the Covid-19 pandemic, DeSantis also regularly flouted the Trump administration\u2019s recommendations on Covid-19 restrictions, marketing his state as a safe haven from strict lockdowns and mask and vaccine mandates. The Florida governor has also touted his battles with major entities like Disney and the Tampa Bay Rays as \u201ca lesson for people on the right,\u201d working to contrast himself with Republican politicians who have long promoted corporate tax cuts and breaks. (Trump has celebrated the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21%, as one of the crowning achievements of his presidency.) Georgia-based conservative commentator Erick Erickson said DeSantis is one of the only Republicans who could reasonably position himself to the right of Trump in a primary on issues like coronavirus restrictions and confronting corporate America. \u201cDeSantis has a record right now on the sweet spots for conservatives. They are turning on Big Business, and he is fighting it. He also has an ability to say he can serve for eight years, not four years. That could be a huge selling point,\u201d Erickson said. But the rush to crown Florida\u2019s governor as the best alternative to Trump has troubled some conservatives, including Ahmari and Schmitz. In an interview with CNN, they cast DeSantis as a safe choice for voters who don\u2019t believe the conservative movement needs to be revamped but \u201ca worse choice than Trump\u201d and \u201ca black box\u201d on foreign policy. \u201cIt is precisely because we think the institutional Republican party and mainstream conservative movement has failed the U.S. and working-class people that we want someone to continue to rankle them,\u201d said Ahmari, claiming that conservatives \u201cstill don\u2019t know a lot about [DeSantis] since he\u2019s been a governor, not a national politician.\u201d (DeSantis spent five years representing Florida in the House of Representatives but has only recently emerged as a rising star on the political right). One former Trump campaign aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, expressed similar concern about the early support for DeSantis inside the conservative ecosystem. \u201cIs it acceptable to start weighing our options if Trump doesn\u2019t run? Totally. Maybe he runs but he\u2019s been indicted and no longer seems electable. That\u2019s another fair question to consider. But I think it\u2019s a mistake to view Ron DeSantis as heir apparent just because he\u2019s having a moment right now,\u201d said the former aide, speaking hypothetically about the legal woes around Trump, who has not been charged with a crime. Neither DeSantis nor Trump have formally launched a 2024 campaign and there could be serious obstacles for either GOP heavyweight to compete at the presidential level depending on how the next few months pan out. Trump allies launch new super PAC to bolster GOP candidates in midterms as former President eyes 2024 campaign Though the former President remains immensely popular with his base and has amassed an unprecedented war chest across his fundraising committees since leaving office, he is facing numerous investigations at the federal and state level that have already forced him to spend millions on his legal defense. Moreover, Trump and his three oldest children were sued last week by New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged civil fraud violations at the Trump Organization. Trump has also frustrated Republican leaders and conservatives who wish he would shift his focus away from re-litigating the 2020 election, which he continues to falsely claim was stolen. Some conservatives say his intense focus on the past could create enthusiasm issues for a third White House bid. \u201cThe worst thing that could happen for Trump is he gets boring,\u201d said the senior conservative organization official. \u201cIf he just rehashes 2020, then he could lose. He won in 2016 because the grievances were about other things \u2013 immigration, culture \u2013 not him.\u201d Meanwhile, there are questions about DeSantis potentially peaking early \u2013 much the same as other governors have at the outset of presidential primaries. The Florida governor is currently competing against Republican-turned Democrat Charlie Crist and though he is widely expected to win in November, it is unclear if the momentum behind him now can last another two years \u2013 especially if he challenges Trump, by far the most incendiary candidate in 2016, in a primary. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time to keep buzz up between now and the primaries of 2024. Most people in that sort of situation begin to fade and someone else starts getting the headlines,\u201d said Erickson.",

            "article_content": "In a private memo last summer, House Democratic leaders warned their party\u2019s most vulnerable members about the \u201cenduring\u201d and \u201cpotent\u201d attacks waged by Republicans over policing and crime, counseling them to be far more proactive in their support for law enforcement than they were in the 2020 cycle. But less than two months before the midterm elections, House Democrats are scrambling to resolve an intra-party squabble over police funding, which is threatening to undermine their carefully coordinated efforts to show a united front and combat stepped-up attacks from Republicans over crime and public safety \u2014 even as dozens of the party\u2019s most vulnerable members seek to defuse those attacks through a flurry of pro-police campaign ads and local events with law enforcement. \u201cFrankly, anti-law enforcement rhetoric is not helpful,\u201d Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota, a frontline Democrat in a tough reelection race, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve openly been critical of any member of Congress, including those in my own party, who would stop a bill (to fund police departments) at a moment in time where we need to really be focused on public safety in all of our communities.\u201d For months, a group of House centrists \u2013 scarred by a tougher-than-expected 2020 election cycle when the GOP\u2019s attacks on Democrats around \u201cdefunding the police\u201d succeeded in some key races \u2013 have been pressing for floor action on a package of bills designed to boost resources for law enforcement and make communities safer ahead of the midterms. But the effort has been hampered by long-running divisions between the moderate and progressive wings of the party, with lawmakers still hung up over language to ensure accountability for police officers. Despite months of talks, House Democrats \u2013 who are working with a razor-thin majority \u2013 have yet to reach a deal on the issue. In a sign of how tricky the issue has been, they\u2019ve had to drop at least one police funding measure, sponsored by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a vulnerable House Democrat from Virginia, from the negotiations citing a lack of a path forward. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why that should be that hard,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat whose seat is targeted by Republicans. \u201cWe have a political party in America, led by people who want to defund the police. It\u2019s not the Democrats. We have a chance to demonstrate that by passing these bills.\u201d And even if Democrats manage to reach an agreement and hold a vote during the handful of days left on the legislative calendar before the midterms, the bills are going nowhere in the 50-50 Senate. Progressives and some top members of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus are not yet on board, though negotiators are expected to continue intense behind-the-scenes negotiations. Democratic leaders said they could put a deal on the floor as soon as this week if there\u2019s a breakthrough. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to make sure that the guardrails, the accountabilities are there, and I\u2019m very much supporting making sure that we\u2019re not looking at headcounts increasing without any accountability, without transparency,\u201d said Rep. Joyce Beatty, the Ohio Democrat who chairs the CBC. Democrats in some of the most competitive races in the country believe it\u2019s critical that they do everything they can to boost their law enforcement bona fides and shield themselves from the avalanche of Republican attacks on the campaign trail \u2013  even as some dismiss the GOP effort as an attempt to find something that will stick after gas prices came down and abortion rights energized the Democratic base. \u201cI think more people realize that saying \u2018defund the police\u2019 is just a dumb statement, especially in my district, where I can\u2019t fill all the positions in my police forces,\u201d said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat who is also locked in a competitive battle for reelection. Some moderate Democrats, who have expressed open frustration with their progressive colleagues embrace of calls to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d are worried that even if they are able to pass a bill, there\u2019s little time left to reap the rewards on the campaign trail. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat in a difficult race, said he wants a vote on the package, which includes his bill that would authorize $6.5 billion in community-based efforts to reduce crime over the next eight years, and called on his party leaders to schedule a vote despite the resistance of some in his caucus. \u201cThe overwhelming majority supports the package,\u201d said Horsford, who at the age of 19 lost his father to gun violence. \u201cAnd just like infrastructure, when the leadership brings the bills to the floor, a whole lot of folks that are saying they\u2019re not going to support something suddenly get behind it because it\u2019s the right thing to do for their constituents. These bills help people back home in our districts.\u201d Progressives say they\u2019re still working to reach a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re still working through it. We\u2019re all working in good faith. And we\u2019ll see if we can get there,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \u201cWe have small margins in the House, and everything that passes the House has to have enough votes.\u201d Despite the logjam, Democratic leaders have sought to carefully cultivate the image of a pro-police party and armed its members with a concrete strategy to counter the GOP narrative that they are soft on crime or support defunding the police. Last summer, the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm circulated the memo, which was obtained by CNN, that encouraged House Democrats to offer a clear and direct rebuttal in their public messaging and advertising; highlight specific examples of where Democrats have funneled money toward the police; and enlist at least one active or retired member of law enforcement who can validate their record on crime and public safety. \u201cLies need to be answered with both the truth and actions. And show what we stand for. And I think we\u2019ve done both,\u201d Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying that the lie gets halfway around the world before the truth gets its pants on. And what we learned from 2020 is that we have to effectively respond to Republican lies about law enforcement and put our money where our mouth is.\u201d Vulnerable Democrats are heeding the advice, determined to not let the GOP attacks go unanswered, though Republicans are still slightly outpacing their Democratic counterparts when it comes to advertising spending on the topic: Over the last month, Republicans have spent about $26 million airing 99 ads about crime, while Democrats have spent about $22 million airing 66 ads, according to data from the firm AdImpact. Reps. Elaine Luria of Virginia and Jared Golden of Maine, and congressional candidates Liz Mathis in Iowa and Adam Gray in California, are among the Democrats who have run campaign ads touting endorsements from members of the law enforcement community. Spanberger, a former CIA officer, also has an ad mentioning how her father was a fellow former law enforcement officer. Other Democrats have highlighted their support for police in campaign ads. Congressional candidate Wiley Nickel of North Carolina vowed in a campaign ad to \u201cfund the police,\u201d congressional candidate Hillary Scholten of Michigan promised to \u201cuphold the rule of law,\u201d and Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio touted a bill she supported that helped fund more than 100 police officers in her district, arguing in the spot that defunding the police is \u201cflat out wrong.\u201d Meanwhile, Craig, who was vocal in her opposition to a Minneapolis ballot initiative that would have abolished the city\u2019s police department, has done several ride-alongs with local police departments \u2013 an experience that Craig said led her to sponsor a resolution encouraging her colleagues to embark on similar endeavors in their districts. Craig\u2019s race is one of the most expensive House races in the country, and her seat is a top target for the GOP this fall. \u201cI\u2019ve been really clear that I am adamantly opposed to defunding the police. And I\u2019ve taken some grief from Democrats for it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut \u2026 we have to make sure that we have a pipeline of police officers who are going to support our communities.\u201d In their messaging, Democrats have also tried to link crime to gun safety, a key issue in critical suburban battleground districts. And they also see a new opportunity to turn the table on Republicans, as the MAGA wing of the party has criticized the police after the Capitol riot and called to defund the FBI in the wake of the recent search of Mar-a-Lago \u2013 a stance which Maloney called \u201cnuts.\u201d Malinowski, the New Jersey Democrat, said he has tried to stay on the \u201coffensive\u201d in saying he \u201cstands by the police\u201d by denouncing GOP attacks against the FBI after the search at Mar-a-Lago last month. And he says passing police funding bills can only give Democrats more ammunition to show a contrast with the GOP. \u201cI think our position would be even stronger if we pass these bills to demonstrate that Democrats, while asking for reasonable reforms in policing, to policing in this country, also stand by the police, defend the police,\u201d he said. Kaptur cut a campaign ad highlighting how her GOP opponent, J.R. Majewski, attended the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Washington on January 6, 2021, and has been critical of the Capitol Police. \u201cMajewksi does not support law enforcement. He should not be our congressman,\u201d a sheriff says in the ad. But it remains to be seen if the Democrats\u2019 carefully orchestrated counter messaging will work, especially amid their struggle to pass the package of policing bills, which comes as Republicans have increasingly leaned into crime as a central campaign theme. They have seized on the recent uptick in violent crime and are also in some cases trying to link the issue with the border and immigration \u2013 another issue that revs up their base. \u201cDemocrats\u2019 pro-criminal policies are directly to blame for the crime wave terrorizing communities,\u201d said Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm. \u201cSecurity is on the ballot this November and that\u2019s bad news for every vulnerable Democrat.\u201d Democrats who support the package of public safety bills say they need the measure to help defend themselves. One vulnerable Democrat pinned the blame squarely on a handful of progressive members for withholding their support for a bill that they even acknowledge is simply meant to send a message on where their party stands \u2013 not actually become law. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, is trying to sell fellow members of the progressive caucus on the package of bills being negotiated. Asked why getting a deal has been so difficult, Omar said Tuesday: \u201cThese are just a lot of conversations that are constantly in flux. I don\u2019t know if it is hard \u2013 things are moving. We feel optimistic that we will reach a deal soon.\u201d Omar said discussion about using the legislation to rebut attacks against defunding the police \u201cis not\u201d part of the deliberations. \u201cWe just want to do the right thing,\u201d Omar said. The problem for Democrats is the math: With a narrow margin in the House, and with Republicans expected to unify against the messaging bill, Speaker Nancy Pelosi can only afford a handful of defections in order to pass the bill. Beatty said the holdup is not due to Democratic infighting. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard because we have Republicans who won\u2019t support most of the stuff we do,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Democrats and this isn\u2019t about the Congressional Black Caucus. This is about the United States Congress. And so when you\u2019re trying to present something that we need to have bipartisan support, it\u2019s difficult.\u201d",

If it were possible to separate out the political gamesmanship, secrecy and apparent false promises, the planeloads of migrants taken from Texas to Massachusetts and paid for by Florida could be viewed as a public service. Instead, the planes are now the subject of a criminal investigation and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the new king of gotcha politics, was chuckling on Fox on Monday night, bragging about sending a message to cities that provide sanctuary to migrants and promising it would pay off for Republicans in November. Too bad everyone can\u2019t work together because by all accounts border authorities are overwhelmed and there are people at the border who need somewhere to go. US authorities have recorded more than 2 million encounters with people trying to cross the southern border this fiscal year and more than 203,000 in August alone, new data from US Customs and Border Protection showed. Read CNN\u2019s full report. Many encounters \u2013 22% last month \u2013 are repeat attempts; the 2 million encounters represent fewer than 2 million migrants. Many of those encountered at the border are still turned away under a pandemic-related health authority a federal judge won\u2019t let the Biden administration end. But tens of thousands of migrants seeking asylum on US soil can\u2019t be returned to Mexico, which won\u2019t accept migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Migrants from those three countries alone numbered 55,333 in August. CNN\u2019s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller has talked to US and Mexican authorities and told me Mexican drug cartels are gouging migrants, charging exorbitant sums to get them across the border after harrowing treks from Central and South America. Once in the US, the migrants that cannot be returned to Mexico face an uncertain future as aid organizations try to help connect them with family and contacts in the US while they await asylum proceedings. When those organizations find enough migrants interested in going to New York, Chicago or Washington, DC, they call for a bus in Texas. That\u2019s a separate process than DeSantis\u2019 decision to step in on behalf of Florida and transport migrants from Texas to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Miller told me in an ideal world, the US would have a sort of Marshall Plan to stop such mass migration at the source in Central and South American countries. In the US, mayors and governors would ideally be working together to distribute migrants. \u201cThe politics in the United States right now are a little too brittle for government to think of each others\u2019 interests,\u201d he said. The migrants can\u2019t just stay in border towns, either. Read these reports from El Paso, where migrants are sleeping on the streets because shelters are full, according to the Dallas Morning News and the Texas Tribune. Rather than ask Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for help, El Paso\u2019s Democratic Mayor Oscar Leeser is using emergency funds to facilitate his own buses to New York City, where many migrants are headed. \u201cThe people are not coming to El Paso, they\u2019re coming to America,\u201d Leeser said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday. \u201cAnd we look at them and we talk to them and say, \u2018Where do you want to go and what\u2019s your destination?\u2019 And then we will take them and help them get to their destination.\u201d The big change, he said, is that unlike in the past, people are showing up, in particular from Venezuela, without money and without a place to go. \u201cWe have about 50 percent of the people today that do not have a sponsor, they don\u2019t have money,\u201d Leeser said. \u201cSo we\u2019re helping and working to get them to where they want to go.\u201d New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Monday he has been in communication with Leeser but has not found cooperation from Abbott. While New York will provide sanctuary, he said the city is getting overwhelmed, according to CNN\u2019s report. \u201cWe are not telling anyone that New York can accommodate every migrant in the city,\u201d the mayor said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re not encouraging people to send eight, nine buses a day. That is not what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re saying that as a sanctuary city with right to shelter, we\u2019re going to fulfill that obligation. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar, an elected Democrat, said Monday the migrants shuttled by Florida from Texas to Massachusetts appear to have been \u201clured\u201d with false promises of work before being sent to Martha\u2019s Vineyard last week. It\u2019s not clear what law the operation might have violated, but Bexar said his office is looking into it and criticized using people as political pawns with \u201cfalse pretenses.\u201d DeSantis, meanwhile, said Monday night that the migrants on planes signed releases and were given a map of Martha\u2019s Vineyard before being left there. \u201cIt was clearly voluntary and all the other nonsense you\u2019re hearing is just not true,\u201d he said on Fox. President Joe Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware was preparing for possible migrant arrivals after reports of another unannounced flight from Texas. Read more. CNN\u2019s Ed Lavandera went to the street corners in San Antonio where the migrants were approached and was told those offers are still being made. Julian Cyr, a state senator in Massachusetts who represents Cape Cod, said on CNN Tuesday that the migrants sent to Massachusetts have all been given lawyers and are being housed at a local military base. He said it\u2019s impossible to argue the migrants agreed to go to Martha\u2019s Vineyard since they apparently didn\u2019t know where they were going and no authorities in Massachusetts were warned. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t about having non-border communities pitch in in this effort,\u201d Cyr said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t about helping vulnerable families seek a better life. This is about using human beings as part of a political stunt. And that is just inhumane and it is shameful.\u201d Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents El Paso, argued there has been too much focus on restricting immigration and closing borders. \u201cWe have over the last 30 years as a country, tried it the Republican way, and we\u2019ve shrunken legal pathways,\u201d Escobar said on CNN Tuesday. \u201cWhen you shrink or eliminate legal pathways you\u2019re going to see more irregular migration,\u201d she said. She wants Congress to authorize more processing stations for asylum seekers, including in countries outside the US, to make it easier and more seamless for migrants to enter the country. CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez notes that it\u2019s not clear exactly how the Biden administration will proceed. She writes: Administration officials conceded in a call with reporters Monday that the increase in migration is a challenge. Asked whether the administration is considering moving migrants into the interior, an official cited ongoing discussion about how to improve processing along the border. \u201cOne solution that we know is not a good solution is for hostile governors to be busing or flying migrants \u2013 often misleading them \u2013 to places where they had no intention of going with no coordination whatsoever,\u201d the official said. Appearing on Fox, DeSantis claimed credit for bringing immigration to the top of voters\u2019 minds just before the election. \u201cImmigration and the border, I think, is now \u2026 a front burner issue,\u201d he told Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity. \u201cAnd I think this is one where Republicans have the advantage, without question. So run on it. And then if we do get majorities in the Congress, Sean, they need to do something with that power to hold Biden accountable on this issue.\u201d DeSantis is probably right on part of this point. Republicans in recent history have reliably used immigration as a wedge issue heading into elections, most notably in 2010, when they won control of the House of Representatives, and 2016, when Donald Trump won the White House. In a recent NBC News poll of registered voters, the Republican Party has a massive 36-point advantage over Democrats on \u201cdealing with border security,\u201d and a smaller but still significant 17-point advantage on \u201cdealing with immigration.\u201d While asylum seekers being bused or flown by Texas, Arizona and Florida are in the country legally as they await hearings in the judicial system, it\u2019s not at all clear that your average US voter necessarily views them that way. The asylum seekers from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua often cross the border without documentation and then declare themselves to border agents before being released to await a hearing, a process that takes years. The perception is hugely consequential. If they perceive immigration as legal, 44% of registered voters surveyed in a New York Times/Siena poll released this month agree with Democrats on the issue, while another 44% said they side with Republicans. But when it comes to illegal immigration, a majority of registered voters, 51%, agree with Republicans compared to 37% who agree with Democrats. Republicans hold a similar edge on the economy, the other issue on which they\u2019re focusing.",

            "article_content": "If America\u2019s angry politics were not jumbled enough, President Joe Biden just injected new uncertainty into a head-spinning midterm election ride. His comment, in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that aired on Sunday night, that it was \u201cmuch too early\u201d to consider a 2024 reelection bid that had previously seemed a given added to a swirling sense of turmoil ahead of November\u2019s critical vote.   The midterm campaign had once seemed certain to turn on Biden\u2019s low approval ratings. But Democrats have some momentum after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion and the President\u2019s approval ratings began ticking up amid falling gas prices. After earlier predictions that the midterm election curse that haunts first-term presidents would bring a Republican wave, the GOP now seems to be burying its most effective message \u2013 tied to raging inflation under Biden \u2013 by reigniting the culture wars. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis caused uproar \u2013 but likely boosted his potential Republican presidential primary campaign \u2013 by transporting a group of Venezuelan migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard last week. A day earlier, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina shocked colleagues trying to walk a fine line on abortion by proposing a bill that would impose a nationwide ban on the procedure after 15 weeks. Add to all this the extraordinary spectacle of former President Donald Trump still falsely claiming he won the last election and dropping into mob speak to make dark allusions of possible violence if he is charged for mishandling highly classified documents. Seven weeks from Election Day, unpredictable and possibly dangerous political forces are swelling and it\u2019s hard to get a fix on the issues that will decide whether Democrats hang on to both chambers of Congress or lose one or both. It is into that destabilized political stew that Biden\u2019s comments, broadcast as he was in London for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, arrived. Of course, this could just be Biden being Biden. His off-the-cuff remarks often get walked back by his staff. But his statement, and a similar one by first lady Jill Biden last week that they had not discussed a reelection race, will be certain to stir speculation. \u201cLook, my intention, as I said to begin with, is that I would run again. But it\u2019s just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen,\u201d Biden told CBS\u2019 Scott Pelley on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Biden, who has a tragedy-scarred life, has often said he\u2019s a \u201cgreat respecter of fate.\u201d He would be over 80 if he runs again, and a lot could happen before the 2024 election in which Trump is already indicating he\u2019s likely to run. But Biden\u2019s remarks were striking given that he left himself an out. They\u2019ll likely renew questions about who, other than him, might be a Democratic candidate in 2024 \u2013 a tide of speculation that had quieted following the President\u2019s recent run of legislative success. DeSantis is one possible Republican candidate whether Trump runs or not. He\u2019s already used his platform to establish a formidable conservative power base on transgender issues and Covid-19 precautions, which would look impressive in a Republican presidential primary. He got a standing ovation far from Florida, in Kansas, on Sunday for sending migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, basking in praise for a move that critics branded un-American and inhumane. In some ways, the attempts by DeSantis and Graham to appeal to the populist base hint at political malpractice in the party since the highest year-on-year jump in food prices since 1979 would seem to give Republicans a winning campaign theme. DeSantis gets standing ovation from GOP voters after flying migrants to Martha's Vineyard But while a searing focus on the economy is the stated preference of GOP leaders, base voters are often drawn to the kind of stunt politics pioneered by Trump and DeSantis. It can sometimes look like the GOP is locked in a perpetual primary cycle to appeal to its most fervent voters while ignoring the wider general electorate, which could prove problematic for some of the Trump-backed candidates who won this year\u2019s primaries. It\u2019s far too early to call November\u2019s elections, which see Republicans still well positioned to take the House and in striking distance of capturing the Senate. History suggests that Democrats are in for a drubbing, but earlier predictions of a Republican wave look shakier, as a new NBC News poll shows Democrats moving into a tie with the GOP on the generic ballot and Biden\u2019s approval ratings at their highest point since October. Democratic momentum has grown as the GOP returns to its culture war playbook, especially following the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion decision in June. The unexpected twists with Election Day less than two months away are scrambling the 2022 campaign, and making it far harder to predict what will be the winning issue set for the victorious party in an internally estranged nation. Trump looks to thwart Tim Ryan's courtship of Republican voters in Ohio All of this is also taking place against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s effort to turn the midterms into an arena for revenge for the 2020 election, which he refuses to accept he lost, and his deepening legal problems following the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago. His darkening and inciteful rhetoric was on show at a rally in Ohio on Saturday night. But the ubiquity of the ex-President, who has not been charged with a crime, risks reminding many more moderate voters why they turned against him. Democrats rushed to capitalize on openings offered by DeSantis and Graham. \u201cThe migrants are human beings and we got to treat them like human beings. They\u2019re being used as political pawns to get publicity,\u201d New York City Mayor Eric Adams said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThis is a blight on our entire country,\u201d he added. Graham's 15-week abortion bill further complicates Republican midterm messaging Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, compared the latest immigration stunts by Republican governors \u2013 including Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, who had migrants dropped off outside the residence of Vice President Kamala Harris last week \u2013 to the hardline anti-migrant policies of the Trump administration. \u201cWhy is it when the Republicans want to enforce their immigration theories, It\u2019s always the kids that end up being the victims,\u201d Durbin said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWe saw it with kids in cages. We saw it with a forcible removal of children from their parents, some who\u2019ve never been reunited with their families. And now, once again, it\u2019s the kids and families that are put on these buses and transported for political purposes across the United States.\u201d DeSantis argued that liberal states like Massachusetts, where the migrants were flown, are to blame for encouraging the influx across the border, and he was defiant during his appearance in deep-red Kansas. \u201cThis is a crisis. It\u2019s now getting a little bit more attention,\u201d DeSantis said. While Republican approaches to the border often seem extreme, there could be some fertile political ground for the party on the issue considering the Biden administration has failed to come up with a convincing strategy to combat border crossings. Earlier this month, Harris said on NBC that the border was \u201csecure\u201d \u2013 a statement that seemed to fly in the face of reality. The Republican approach to immigration is a textbook example of how the two parties are appealing to entirely different electorates in a fractured nation. A Pew Research poll this month, for instance, found that overwhelming majorities of conservatives wanted stronger border security and more deportations of undocumented migrants. Democrats, while viewing border security as important, were most concerned with finding a path for them to stay. Still, majorities of both sets of voters back providing sanctuary to refugees fleeing war and violence. This is one reason why DeSantis\u2019 use of Venezuelan migrants, who may be fleeing a repressive socialist dictatorship, might prove to be a risky move among the broader electorate. Ron DeSantis and Gavin Newsom debut the sensational politics of 2024 It remains unclear whether this scorched earth Republicanism, which parallels Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric, is a good recipe for winning general elections. Former Democratic President Bill Clinton suggested in an interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria Sunday that this brand of relentless attack politics was designed to \u201cscare\u201d people. Democrats, he argued, were trying to solve people\u2019s problems \u2013 but that\u2019s a goal with its own significant challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to build a barn than it is to kick one down. And then when you build it, you\u2019ve got to explain what you built and why it\u2019s a good thing to put your animals in your barn,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, but it\u2019s really worth doing.\u201d While DeSantis appears to eye a future presidential bid by deliberately adopting policies that provoke anger among Democrats, Graham is more curious. Some Washington Republicans have barely contained their frustration at him for saddling the GOP with a new position to defend just as they are trying to contain the political damage from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. But Graham was unrepentant in an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s what I would tell the Republican Party: Be not afraid. Stand up for the baby,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re asked about abortion, the answer can\u2019t be \u2018I\u2019d like to lower inflation.\u2019 Give a logical answer.\u201d In a sign of the political sensitivity of the issue, South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds wouldn\u2019t endorse his colleague\u2019s proposal on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI think the states are in a better shape to explore and to find the right direction on a state-by-state basis.\u201d Rounds, however, didn\u2019t break with DeSantis and Abbott on the other top issue on the right this week \u2013 immigration. The unity on that topic proves how, just as it was for Trump in 2016, it looks to be a mobilizing force for the GOP base in 2022 and beyond.",

            "article_content": "America got a preview this week of what the 2024 presidential campaign might look like if President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump stepped aside to clear the way for the next generation\u2019s possible candidates in waiting: Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Gavin Newsom of California. DeSantis and Newsom, a Republican and a Democrat who are each running for reelection this fall, have been shadowboxing with ferocity on the sidelines since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 demonstrating their shrewd political instincts, a voracious appetite for attention and the ability to fire up their parties\u2019 bases better than many of their peers. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who is also defending his seat in November, has often been in the mix too. All three governors attempted to drive the national narrative this week with dueling political stunts, flexing their power through made-to-go-viral maneuvers that would have been unthinkable in the more staid age of campaign politics that preceded the Trump years. The political numbers that explain the Abbott and DeSantis migrant decisions DeSantis and Abbott forced the immigration issue by sending migrants to liberal areas because they know there are few issues that do more to fire up the GOP base \u2013 but also because that\u2019s the turf they want to fight elections on in 2022 and 2024. They also know they have an opening, even beyond the base, because the Biden administration has failed to articulate a clear policy in the eyes of many voters and has been grappling with nearly 2 million border encounters reported by US Customs and Border Protection in the fiscal year that ends September 30. At least for a day or two, they changed the national conversation from the topic that Democrats want to talk about ahead of the midterms: how abortion rights are being rolled back after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. That was the area Newsom drew attention to this week by putting up billboards in red states, as he seeks to make California a safe harbor for abortion and cast himself as a champion for reproductive rights. The ultimate showman, Trump ushered American voters into this new era of performative politics with his bare-knuckled tactics, proving that incendiary acts would be rewarded at the ballot box by many in the GOP. The array of stunts that Trump pulled is too long to mention. But they included trying to unnerve Hillary Clinton at a 2016 debate by showing up with women who accused her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of sexual misconduct. While in office, Trump made his infamous 2020 march from the White House \u2013 in the midst of nearby racial injustice protests \u2013 to St. John\u2019s Church, where he held up a bible and declared himself to be a \u201claw and order\u201d president. Those kinds of moves often electrified his base and infuriated the left, casting the die for the current politics of outrage. Newsom, DeSantis and Abbott are testing what the next phase of that playbook looks like. This week, DeSantis cribbed the moves of other GOP governors like Abbott and Arizona\u2019s Doug Ducey, who have been sending busloads of migrants from the border to liberal cities like New York, Chicago and Washington, DC, to protest the glaring shortcomings of the Biden administration\u2019s immigration policy. DeSantis took those tactics to the next level by arranging to send two planes of migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the uber-liberal wealthy Massachusetts enclave that has long been the vacation playground of Democratic presidents. Uproar ensued as critics accused DeSantis of upending the lives of vulnerable migrants from Venezuela to achieve his political goals. Though islanders generously offered assistance after the flights arrived Wednesday afternoon, it was perceived as a cruel joke to send planeloads of destitute people to a tiny island where off-season jobs are scarce, affordable housing is non-existent and there is very little shelter capacity. A similarly chaotic scene unfolded in Washington, DC, on Thursday where Abbott had directed two buses of migrants to be dropped off at the residence of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been tasked with part of the administration\u2019s immigration portfolio. DeSantis ratchets up his play for Trump's MAGA loyalists They were left on the sidewalk, some carrying their belongings in trash bags, until volunteers swooped in to help. Abbott tweeted that Harris \u201cdenies the crisis\u201d and said that led him to send \u201cmigrants to her backyard to call on the Biden administration to do its job & secure the border.\u201d Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, retorted that \u201cthey were just literally dumped like human garbage\u201d on the street. DeSantis has defended his role in the Martha\u2019s Vineyard transports by asserting that liberal towns and cities that want to offer sanctuary are better equipped to handle the influx of migrants into the US. Florida, he said earlier this week, is \u201cnot a sanctuary state.\u201d He added that \u201cit\u2019s better to be able to go to a sanctuary jurisdiction, and, yes, we will help facilitate that transport for you to be able to go to greener pastures\u201d \u2013 language that lent credence to the notion that migrants are being treated like livestock as they are shuttled around the country. Newsom, who has burnished his star power in Democratic circles by trolling red-state governors like DeSantis and Abbott for what he describes as their assault on human rights, was among the loudest critics this week. He tweeted a letter that he sent to the Department of Justice asking officials to investigate the transports and \u201cthese inhumane efforts to use kids as political pawns,\u201d a reference to several Venezuelan families with children who were on the Vineyard flights. He noted that several of the migrants alleged that \u201ca recruiter induced them to accept the offer of travel based on false representations that they would be transported to Boston and would receive expedited access to work authorization.\u201d Newsom suggested such a scheme could be criminal \u2013 possibly even supporting \u201ccharges of kidnapping under relevant state laws.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maria Santana reported that three migrants who were sent to Martha\u2019s Vineyard were told by a woman named \u201cPerla\u201d that they would get help with shelter and jobs once they arrived. At a Friday news conference, DeSantis responded to the assertions in Newsom\u2019s letter with an insult: \u201cI think his hair gel is interfering with his brain function.\u201d He also said he intends to use \u201cevery penny\u201d of some $12 million that Florida budgeted to relocate migrants, calling this week\u2019s moves \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d The California governor relayed his response by Tweeting, in part: \u201cHey @GovRonDeSantis, clearly you\u2019re struggling, distracted, and busy playing politics with people\u2019s lives. Since you have only one overriding need \u2013 attention \u2013 let\u2019s take this up & debate,\u201d Newsom tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my hair gel. You bring your hairspray. Name the time before Election Day.\u201d Gavin Newsom erects billboards in red states advertising abortion services in California Newsom\u2019s letter to the Department of Justice was the latest extension of his effort to set the progressive agenda, using DeSantis and Abbott as his foils while showing that, unlike Biden for most of his first term, he\u2019s eager to engage in tough political combat with his adversaries. Earlier this summer on July 4, Newsom began airing ads on Fox News targeting DeSantis by telling Floridians that freedom is \u201cunder attack in your state\u201d because of DeSantis\u2019 moves to ban books, restrict voting, limit the discussion of sexuality in classrooms and curtail access to abortion. DeSantis\u2019 campaign responded by trashing Newsom\u2019s record in California, with his spokesman telling CNN he\u2019d turned California into a \u201chellhole.\u201d Newsom ratcheted up the political stunts this week in a move destined to infuriate abortion opponents. He announced a new website that is intended to link women in states where abortion is being banned or curtailed with reproductive health care and abortion services in California, including tools to help them find providers and how to seek financial assistance. But he didn\u2019t stop there \u2013 going on to erect 18 billboards advertising California\u2019s abortion services in seven red states that have enacted abortion restrictions: Indiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas. \u201cNeed an abortion?\u201d one of the billboards reads, \u201cCalifornia is ready to help.\u201d Like the moves from DeSantis and Abbott, it\u2019s a gambit that could complicate Newsom\u2019s efforts to demonstrate mainstream appeal in a future presidential run, but one that will bring him adulation within his base. It remains unclear whether Trump will make another bid for the White House, but even if he doesn\u2019t, DeSantis, Abbott and Newsom are demonstrating that his circus politics are here to stay.",

            "article_content": "By arranging to fly two planes of migrants onto the tony island of Martha\u2019s Vineyard on Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis has thrust Florida into an escalating battle between red state leaders and the Biden administration over the US-Mexico border and once again put himself at the forefront of a political cause that is animating Republican voters two months before the midterm elections. For months, DeSantis has been plotting out loud his plans to get Florida involved in redirecting migrants from the border in a way that would maximize heartburn for Democratic leaders. His administration secured $12 million in the state budget to pay for migrant relocation and he has repeatedly threatened to use the money to send them to President Joe Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware, among other liberal strongholds. DeSantis claims credit for sending 2 planes carrying migrants to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts When he laid out his immigration agenda at a December news conference, DeSantis teased Martha\u2019s Vineyard as a potential destination, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat tongue-in-cheek but it is true, if you sent to Delaware or Martha\u2019s Vineyard or some of these places, the border would be secure the next day.\u201d And last month, DeSantis telegraphed that Florida\u2019s involvement in moving migrants might start at the southern border, not with people who had arrived in his state. \u201cWe do have money to be able to do (that), but that\u2019s from people from the southern border, that\u2019s not going in the interior of Florida,\u201d DeSantis said at an August press conference. Still, as the maneuver played out in real time \u2013 with jarring images of an estimated 50 people, some who fled a brutal South American dictatorship, wandering an unfamiliar Northeastern vacation spot unprepared for their arrival \u2013 it sent shockwaves through Florida and Massachusetts and rattled those left to deal with the fallout. And it served to put the country on notice that the reach of DeSantis, a hard-charging Republican leader who is weighing a campaign for president in 2024, already extends well beyond his state\u2019s boundaries. \u201cAll those people in DC, and New York were beating their chests when (Donald) Trump was president, saying they were so proud to be sanctuary jurisdictions saying how bad it was to have a secure border,\u201d DeSantis said at a news conference Thursday morning. \u201cThe minute even a small fraction of what those border towns deal with every day is brought to their front door, they all of a sudden go berserk.\u201d \u201cIt just shows you\u2026their virtue signaling is a fraud,\u201d said DeSantis, who\u2019s running for a second term in November. In Massachusetts, where local officials scrambled to find accommodations for the migrants, Democratic leaders accused the Republican governor of orchestrating a political stunt with human lives. \u201cThink about the governor of Florida, one of the largest states in the nation, spending his time hatching a secret plot to ship up 50 immigrants here, families, some of them children as young as four, and use them as political pawns just so he can get on Tucker Carlson and beat his chest about how he\u2019s tough on immigration,\u201d Massachusetts state Rep. Dylan Fernandes, a Democrat, said Thursday morning on CNN. White House says DeSantis and Abbott sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard and DC is a 'cruel, premeditated political stunt' \u201cHe is a coward, and the real story is the island community that has rallied to come together and support these people \u2013 they represent the best of what America has to offer.\u201d In Florida, the Democratic Party Chairman Manny Diaz called it \u201ca new low\u201d for the Florida governor. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist said, \u201cEverything Ron DeSantis does is to score political points with his hard right base in a thinly veiled attempt to run for President \u2013 but it\u2019s Floridians who pay the price.\u201d This is not the first time DeSantis has waded into the country\u2019s divisive immigration debate in a way that has maximized exposure for the Republican governor while costing taxpayers. In June of last year, DeSantis sent law enforcement to the southern border, insisting he had \u201canswered the call\u201d for help from Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona. A month later, DeSantis visited the border to hold a news conference with Abbott, and he paired it with a fundraising pitch to his supporters. Those actions earned DeSantis considerable praise from conservative commentators and didn\u2019t noticably hurt his political standing in his state, where one in five residents identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino. It remains to be seen if immigrant and Spanish-speaking communities will respond more negatively to DeSantis sending migrants, who were legally processed at the border, 2,000 miles to Massachusetts. Many of those on the planes to Martha\u2019s Vineyard said their country of origin was Venezuela, where millions of people are fleeing the oppressive regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. More than half the Venezuelans in the country are in Florida, according to a 2020 Migration Policy Institute report, with 109,000 just in the Miami metropolitan area. Political observers in Florida have noted the Venezuelan community\u2019s growing political clout in a state that is often won on the margins. \u201cWe are here today to tell the Governor that no Hispanic, no immigrant, but in this case we, Venezuelans, are not pieces on his political boardgame to get headlines and to get political points in his quest to become the Republican nominee for the 2024 Presidential Election,\u201d said Adelys Ferro, director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, at a news conference Thursday in South Florida. It is not clear if DeSantis and Abbott are coordinating efforts at the border, or competing. Abbot has bussed thousands of migrants to Democratic cities in recent weeks. The morning after the two planes landed in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, buses from Texas dropped off migrants outside the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC, where Vice President Kamala Harris resides. Like DeSantis, Abbott is running for reelection this year and is also a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. Earlier this summer, DeSantis was critical of Texas\u2019 response to the surge of migrants at the border, suggesting the Lone Star State shouldn\u2019t be letting them cross over to the US in the first place. \u201cWhat they need to do, Texas, should just send them back across the border,\u201d DeSantis said in June. \u201cYou know, who cares what the feds are saying they\u2019re not doing their job. Or not let them come across the border to begin with because they go right across the river. They just walk right across. No one\u2019s stopping. So you know, some pushback I think would be good.\u201d DeSantis has also been recruiting more Republicans to join his hardline approach to border migration. In a widely followed speech in Arizona last month where he campaigned for Kari Lake, the Republican nominee for governor there, DeSantis hinted at more collaboration to come if she is elected. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve told Kari Lake, I said, \u2018Look, if you\u2019re willing to put people on that border and keep them from coming in to begin with, I\u2019ll send National Guard to help with that,\u201d DeSantis said. CNN\u2019s Alta Spells and Melissa Alonso contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s top general feared he would authorize a strike on Iran as his presidency ended. His intelligence chief wondered what Russia had on him. A billionaire friend convinced him to try buying Greenland. A half-dozen top officials considered resigning en masse. Even his wife, first lady Melania Trump, was \u201crattled by the coronavirus and convinced that Trump was screwing up,\u201d according to a forthcoming book from New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker and New Yorker staff writer and CNN global affairs analyst Susan Glasser set to publish on Tuesday. In a phone call with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who maintained ties to the White House despite occasional criticism of Trump, Melania Trump sought help convincing her husband to take the pandemic more seriously. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re blowing this,\u201d she recalled telling her husband,\u201d the authors write. \u201c\u2019This is serious. It\u2019s going to be really bad, and you need to take it more seriously than you\u2019re taking it.\u2019 He had just dismissed her. \u2018You worry too much,\u2019 she remembered him saying. \u2018Forget it.\u2019 \u201c The razor\u2019s-edge instability clouding Trump\u2019s four-year tenure in the White House led many of his senior-most advisers to worry about the fate of the country. The volatility is laid bare in new detail in \u201cThe Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021.\u201d The reporting for the book included two interviews with the former President at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Baker and Glasser write that many of the well-known fears about Trump\u2019s presidency were in fact closer to reality than previously reported, leading to widespread attempts among those who worked for him to head off disaster. 'Schizophrenic nature': Dr. Birx describes what it was like working in Trump's White House The revelations could also foretell the presidency Trump might oversee should he return to the White House in 2025. Trump\u2019s associates have told CNN he could announce a presidential bid after November\u2019s midterm elections. But, as Trump told Baker and Glasser, he won\u2019t invite former Vice President Mike Pence to join his ticket after Pence refused to interfere in the certification of the 2020 election. \u201cIt would be totally inappropriate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMike committed political suicide by not taking votes that he knew were wrong.\u201d The book describes deep concerns among Trump\u2019s national security team, led by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and others, that the then-President would ignite a conflict with Iran in the waning days of his presidency or that he could stumble into nuclear war with North Korea. One administration official told Trump before the 2020 election that if he lost, he should strike Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the authors report. \u201cMilley at the time told his staff it was a \u2018What the f\u2014 are these guys talking about?\u2019 moment,\u201d they write. \u201cNow, it seemed frighteningly possible.\u201d The tensions with Iran even permeated the walls of Mar-a-Lago. Trump told guests at a cocktail party over the holidays in 2020 that he was leaving early to return to Washington because of fears Iran may be trying to assassinate him to avenge the US killing of the country\u2019s top general a year earlier. Concerns over Trump\u2019s behavior on the world stage began nearly as soon as he took office. More than simply a passing grudge, Trump\u2019s desire to withdraw the United States from NATO was in fact a sustained effort that was \u201cmuch more serious than people realized,\u201d one senior White House official said \u2013 an outcome that could have dramatically altered the current war in Ukraine. Following a 2018 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland \u2013 after which Trump sided with Putin over US intelligence agencies who had determined Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election \u2013 the top US intelligence official was left wondering what Trump\u2019s real motives were. \u201cI never could come to a conclusion. It raised the question in everybody\u2019s mind: What does Putin have on him that causes him to do something that undermines his credibility?\u201d Dan Coats, the then-director of national intelligence, reflected to associates afterward, according to the book. And a months-long fixation with purchasing Greenland from Denmark went far deeper than previously disclosed, inspired in the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency by a wealthy friend from New York, the cosmetics heir Ron Lauder. \u201cI said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we have that?\u2019 You take a look at a map. I\u2019m a real estate developer, I look at a corner, I say, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get that store for the building that I\u2019m building,\u2019 etc. It\u2019s not that different,\u201d Trump told the reporters for their book. 'I'm the target of the very far right': Fauci on the impact of disagreeing with Trump Lauder proposed to Trump\u2019s then-national security adviser John Bolton that he act as a \u201cback channel\u201d to the Danish government. Instead, top National Security Council aides engaged for months in secret talks with Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the United States about Greenland. Eventually, however, public revelations about Trump\u2019s plans to buy the island prompted indignation in both Greenland and Denmark, scuttling any effort to enhance the US role in an increasingly strategic area. Trump called the Danish leader \u201cnasty\u201d for rejecting his idea and canceled a trip to Copenhagen. Trump enjoyed friendlier relations with other world leaders, but often imposed his own brand of chaos. Baker and Glasser report Trump once abruptly phoned Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II to inform him he was \u201cgoing to give you the West Bank,\u201d prompting the monarch to tell a friend he thought he was having a heart attack. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe. I was bent doubled over,\u201d he said. And while Trump liked to frequently tout that then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \u2013 who was assassinated in July \u2013 had nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize, Trump had actually explicitly made the request to Abe during dinner in New York. \u201cThe President asked Abe over dinner to nominate him,\u201d a senior Trump national security official says in the book. Baker and Glasser describe previously unreported plans by members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet to collectively resign amid the chaos, only to remain in their posts out of concern for whohe might select to replace them. In encrypted text messages, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told a top aide that five senior officials in the Trump administration \u2013 including the secretaries of Defense, Education and Interior \u2013 were on the verge of quitting amid a particularly chaotic period ahead of the 2018 midterms. \u201cOk for the first time I am actually scared for the country. The insanity has been loosed,\u201d she wrote in the messages. Trump\u2019s demands on his team included outlandish requests like abolishing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after it blocked one of his immigration policies. \u201cLet\u2019s just cancel it,\u201d he told Nielsen, according to the book. He told Nielsen if such a move required legislation, \u201cthen draft a bill to \u2018get rid of the f\u2013king judges\u2019 and have it sent to Congress as soon as possible.\u201d When it came to responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, however, it was his most trusted advisers who were encouraging him to do more, particularly in the early days when Trump appeared nonchalant about the severity of the crisis.",

            "article_content": "Frustrated by Republicans\u2019 intense focus on inflation and President Joe Biden in the party\u2019s closing pitch to voters, some conservatives want to see the GOP talk more about hot-button cultural issues in the final sprint to Election Day. The thinking among critics of the current approach is that Democrats\u2019 most controversial positions are being ignored by Republicans at the expense of a messaging strategy that disproportionately focuses on pocketbook issues, like the economy, gas prices and taxes. And that as Republican candidates and the party\u2019s election apparatus shy away from more divisive issues \u2013 including abortion rights, a topic that was injected into the midterm landscape after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June \u2013 they are creating an automatic opening for Democrats. \u201cAbortion is proving to be a much more galvanizing issue for Democratic voters than inflation is for Republican voters,\u201d said Ryan Girdusky, a conservative commentator and campaign consultant. \u201cThe old Republican idea is that we\u2019ll win suburbanites because they care about pocketbook issues. But to try and galvanize them on the fact they\u2019re going to pay an extra quarter for bacon? They don\u2019t care.\u201d One prominent Republican operative said that while economic issues can be motivating, they \u201cebb and flow and are less likely to galvanize people as consistently and intensely as those that have to do with safety and common sense.\u201d Republicans spent much of the summer talking about soaring gas prices, for example, hoping that pain at the pump would send voters their way this November \u2013 but the national per-gallon average has consistently dropped since June. A new Marist poll released Thursday found a 7-point drop since July in the proportion of Americans who cited inflation as their top voting issue this cycle (30%), though the issue remains the leading overall concern in the same survey. Sprint to the midterms sets off on unsettled political terrain Others pointed to abortion access becoming a motivating issue for Democratic and independent voters, claiming that Republicans \u2013 many of whom have struggled to message around the issue since the Supreme Court ended federal abortion rights with its June decision \u2013 shouldn\u2019t shy away from the issue while also trying try to capitalize on other cultural flashpoints. Last month, Kansas voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have allowed state lawmakers to further restrict abortion access. The development energized many Democrats who have since turned abortion into a top campaign issue. Among the issues that conservatives want to see GOP candidates weave into ads and stump speeches are gender identity, critical race theory, and criminal justice reform, all of which they consider liabilities for most Democrats. \u201cIt is too narrowly focused and it\u2019s thoughtless if you think that the mom who is filling up her gas tank isn\u2019t the same mom who is caring about her kids\u2019 school and making sure that CRT (critical race theory) isn\u2019t part of her kids\u2019 curriculum. That mom is faced with both sets of issues, cultural and economic, and so elected officials need to meet voters where they\u2019re at,\u201d said Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action for America. Anderson said two \u201cseasoned\u201d Republicans fighting for reelection this cycle \u2013 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson \u2013 should be a model for other GOP candidates on confronting a wide array of economic and social issues. The tension between conservatives who want a deeper focus on cultural issues and Republicans who think economic woes are the dominant theme this cycle comes as the GOP grapples with infighting in other areas, too: the caliber of candidates in important Senate and gubernatorial contests, the way party bigwigs are choosing to spend money, and how closely campaigns should align themselves with former President Donald Trump \u2013 particularly as he faces intense legal scrutiny over his keeping of classified records after leaving office. \u201cGo ahead and add this to the pile,\u201d said a GOP strategist who requested anonymity due to their involvement in several races this cycle. \u201cRepublicans can\u2019t agree on a message, we can\u2019t agree on where to invest [campaign cash], and instead of hashing these things out behind closed doors, we\u2019re bickering about it in public.\u201d But some conservatives say the party\u2019s message is the most pressing problem because Republican candidates and outside groups are on the brink of starting to spend aggressively on advertising, and the content of those ads will need to send a jolt of energy through the party\u2019s base if the GOP wants to remain well-positioned to retake the House of Representatives and, potentially the Senate, this fall. \u201cOur closing pitch must be compelling enough to make Republicans want to vote. \u2018It\u2019s the economy stupid,\u2019 no longer fits into that category,\u201d said a Senate campaign aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. For that reason, one conservative group has begun taking matters into its own hands. The dark-money Citizens for Sanity has committed to spending millions of its own this cycle to deliver a counter-message, targeting voters on the internet and airwaves with warnings about so-called wokeness in education, business, and politics. The group has launched a series of provocative radio, television, billboard and newspaper ads that stand in stark contrast to Republicans\u2019 broader economy-themed message. A person familiar with the matter said the group has already spent seven figures this cycle between its advocacy efforts and advertising. One of the group\u2019s recent ads, which has accumulated more than 2 million views on Twitter in less than one week, is a 90-second montage of gruesome local news reports and surveillance footage depicting incidents of violent crime across the country. The ad accuses \u201cwoke far-left politicians\u201d of enabling an \u201cassault on public safety,\u201d among other claims. Republican groups look to boost spending on Senate campaigns after summer of missed opportunities A separate ad launched Tuesday by the Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, tackles the same issue with a more traditional approach, by using Pennsylvania Democratic Senate hopeful John Fetterman\u2019s own words to portray him as soft on crime. The 30-second spot featured two-year-old video footage of Fetterman discussing his efforts as chair of Pennsylvania\u2019s Board of Pardons to end automatic life-without-parole sentences for individuals convicted of second-degree murder. \u201cOur advertising on crime, in particular, is being done in races where it makes the most sense,\u201d said an SLF official, adding that, \u201cgenerally speaking, economic concerns tend to be the top-rated issues.\u201d Ian Prior, a strategic adviser for Citizens of Sanity, said the group wants to capitalize on what he described as a \u201cmajor realignment\u201d in the current political landscape. The group, which has already spent about $670k on advertising since August, according to AdImpact data, will launch a new $600k ad buy across Washington, Texas and Arizona this week focused on crime, \u201cwoke craziness,\u201d and gender ideology, Prior confirmed to CNN. The group is also \u201cmessaging aggressively\u201d in Latino-dominated markets as Republicans try to maintain recent gains in Hispanic support, Prior added, and has previously launched ads in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado around the participation of transgender athletes in male and female sports leagues. \u201cLatinos are fleeing the political left over its embrace of \u2018woke\u2019 policies \u2013 an agenda created by and for wealthy white privileged coastal liberals,\u201d Prior claimed in a statement. (An earlier CNN analysis found a 5-point shift toward Republicans in generic ballot preference among Hispanics, though a recent Pew Research Center study found that 56 percent of Hispanics oppose the ending of federal abortion rights, which could negatively impact Hispanic support for the GOP come November). So far, efforts to nudge Republican candidates and campaigns away from economic issues and toward cultural topics have occurred outside the party consensus. By the end of July, Republicans had spent more than $40.6 million since the beginning of the year on TV ads that referred to inflation, according to the data firm AdImpact. Both privately and publicly, many GOP figures have also acknowledged that they consider inflation and kitchen table issues to be the most important to voters this cycle. \u201cInflation is all that matters to the public\u2026 at the end of the day, people vote with their pocketbooks,\u201d said conservative radio host Erick Erickson on his podcast in mid-August. The SLF official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the party\u2019s internal polling has repeatedly shown that inflation ranks the highest among voters\u2019 concerns, though there are instances where Republicans may need to offer a blended message that goes beyond inflation to focus on crime or immigration, too. The official said they had not seen evidence that wedge issues like gender ideology resonated deeply with broad swaths of voters. What makes 2022 such a unique midterm election \u201cInflation is cutting across most demographic and income groups. Everybody fills up their gas tank, everybody goes to the grocery store, and they are seeing these price increases affect their budgets in real time,\u201d said the official, adding that Republicans have \u201ca buffet of messages\u201d that could work to the party\u2019s advantage this cycle. \u201cThere may be races where we talk almost exclusively about one or the other (inflation or crime and immigration) or we talk about both,\u201d the official said. Even conservatives who have been nudging candidates to talk more about cultural issues said they should balance those messages with proposals to combat economic problems. \u201cMy advice to candidates is to do both at the same time; draw the contrast with the left and run on a winning platform that actually shows voters what you care about,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cRepublicans, I think, have been doing this but they need to do it a lot more in the next 60 days.\u201d A prebuttal to Biden\u2019s primetime speech by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy last Thursday, where the president slammed \u201cextremist\u201d MAGA Republicans and accused his predecessor of being a threat to democracy, could provide one roadmap to candidates, campaigns, and conservative outside groups as they look to reach both middle-of-the-road and grassroots Republicans in the closing weeks of the midterm race. While the California Republican, who is angling to become Speaker if the GOP wins control of the lower chamber, repeatedly criticized the current administration over gas and energy costs and littered his remarks with mentions of the economy, he accused Biden and Democrats of \u201cdismantling American democracy\u201d with their policies. \u201cIs it morally right that our children were forced to stay home from school while politicians dined out? When biological boys are allowed to compete in girls sports, does President Biden think that is fair?\u201d McCarthy said while bemoaning \u201chistoric inflation\u201d and \u201cdaily violence against innocent Americans\u201d in the same breath.",

            "article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 making his first public comments since the US Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade last term, triggering demonstrations across the country \u2013 defended the legitimacy of the court Friday night while also acknowledging it had been \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d to drive into a barricaded high court every morning. Roberts, without directly mentioning protests, said that all of the court\u2019s opinions are open to criticism, but he pointedly noted that \u201csimply because people disagree with opinions, is not a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the court.\u201d He said that it\u2019s the court\u2019s job to interpret the Constitution \u2013 a task that should not be left to the political branches or driven by public opinion. Speaking to an audience of judges attending the 10th Circuit Bench and Bar Conference in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Roberts noted that the metal barricade that had been installed around the building is now down, and he announced that when the justices return to the bench to start a new term next month, the public will finally be able to attend arguments in person once again. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who oversees the 10th Circuit and had spoken Thursday, sat in the front row for the chief justice\u2019s remarks. Acknowledging that the last year had been \u201cdifficult in many respects,\u201d Roberts said he and his colleagues are working to move beyond it. \u201cI think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate is the best way to respond,\u201d he said. He also praised his newest colleague, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and announced she will have her formal investiture on September 30. \u201cShe is going to be a wonderful justice,\u201d he said. Roberts spoke less than a month before a new term is set to begin as the court and the country are still digesting the tumult of rulings in an array of deeply divisive cases, the unprecedented leak of a draft opinion and glimpses of the growing tension on a court driven by an aggressive conservative majority. The new term will launch on October 3 in the shadow of the midterm elections and the justices will consider issues that deeply divide the public, including affirmative action, voting rights, environmental regulations, immigration and religious liberty. At oral arguments and at conference, Roberts will attempt to set the tone of the proceedings, carefully navigating a court consisting of six Republican appointees and three Democratic ones, including Jackson, who was sworn in on June 30. The inside story of how John Roberts failed to save abortion rights Roberts finds himself in an unusual spot, complicated by the fact that there are now five justices to his right who have shown an inclination to reject incrementalism in favor of sweeping opinions that at times overturn precedent. It may be called the \u201cRoberts Court,\u201d but the chief justice only gets one vote and he has at times cast it with a particular sensitivity to institutional concerns. \u201cThis term will again test the chief\u2019s influence over the conservative wing of the court, in particular,\u201d Gregory G. Garre, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins who served as solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration, said in an interview. Roberts has joked before about the limits of his role. \u201cI did learn early on that when you are holding the reins of leadership you should be careful not to tug on them too much \u2013 you will find out they aren\u2019t connected to anything,\u201d Roberts said to laughter during a 2016 appearance at New England Law. Last term, Roberts\u2019 conservative colleagues left him behind in the historic abortion case, Dobbs v. Jackson. Roberts would have allowed the controversial Mississippi law that would have limited abortion access to 15 weeks after conception to take effect, but said he would stop short of reversing Roe, a landmark opinion that had been on the books for almost 50 years. \u201cI would take a more measured course,\u201d the chief wrote. No other justice joined him in perhaps the most important case the court will have decided during his tenure. Yeshiva University doesn't have to recognize LGBTQ student group for now, Sotomayor rules \u201cAs the Dobbs decision underscored last term, as just one of six justices in the conservative majority, the chief no longer has control over the outcome or breadth of decisions,\u201d Garre said. This term, however, could produce a different narrative as Roberts likely joins his fellow conservatives as the justices consider two areas: affirmative action and voting rights. In past cases, Roberts has made clear that he is skeptical of racial preferences, and he has voted to narrow voting rights. \u201cIn prior cases, the chief himself has led the conservative justices in pushing back on the use of race in this context,\u201d Garre said. \u201cBut the chief\u2019s institutionalist instincts may lead him to push for a ruling that at least stops short of overruling precedent in this area.\u201d The affirmative action cases will be heard on October 31, as the justices consider the use of race as a factor in college admissions at Harvard College and the University of North Carolina. (Jackson will not participate in the Harvard case.) Roberts was in dissent in 2016 when the court upheld the race-conscious admissions program at the University of Texas. In addition, in a 2007 case with Roberts in the majority, the court struck down race-based public school assignment programs in Seattle and Louisville. \u201cFor schools that never segregated on the basis of race, such as Seattle, or that have removed the vestiges of past segregation, such as Jefferson County, the way to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, is to stop assigning students on a racial basis,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d In 2014, the court upheld a Michigan ballot initiative that barred race-based preferences as a part of the admissions process for state universities. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a rousing dissent, pointedly repeating some of Roberts\u2019 own language in the 2007 case. Roberts responded. \u201cThe dissent states that \u2018the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race.\u2019 And it urges that \u2018[r]ace matters because of the slights, the snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most crippling of thoughts: \u2018I do not belong here,\u2019\u201d Roberts wrote. Justices worry about the future of the Supreme Court -- and point fingers as to who's to blame \u201cBut it is not \u2018out of touch with reality\u2019 to conclude that racial preferences may themselves have the debilitating effect of reinforcing precisely that doubt, and \u2014 if so \u2014 that the preferences do more harm than good. To disagree with the dissent\u2019s views on the costs and benefits of racial preferences is not to \u2018wish away, rather than confront\u2019 racial inequality. People can disagree in good faith on this issue, but it similarly does more harm than good to question the openness and candor of those on either side of the debate.\u201d The court will also examine the scope of Section 2 of the historic Voting Rights Act that bars regulations that result in a denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race. The law has become a major tool to prohibit discrimination in voting. At issue is a lower court opinion that invalidated Alabama\u2019s congressional map as a likely violation of the law. The lower court ordered another majority Black district to be drawn. But in February, a 5-4 Supreme Court froze that ruling at the request of the state, allowing the current maps for now, and agreed to hear the dispute this term. Roberts sided with the liberals in dissent arguing that the majority was wrong to freeze the lower court ruling. \u201cThe District Court properly applied existing law in an extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction,\u201d Roberts said. But critically, Roberts added that although he would not have granted a stay, he did think the court should hold oral arguments \u201cto resolve the wide range of uncertainties arising under precedent.\u201d Supporters of voting rights are on edge \u2013 cognizant of the fact that in 2013 Roberts wrote an opinion that effectively invalidated a separate section of the law that required states that had a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing election laws. \u201cThings have changed in the South,\u201d Roberts said at the time. At the time, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a scathing dissent arguing that the court\u2019s move was akin to \u201cthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\u201d Both disputes and an array of others will come as the court\u2019s approval rating is at a new low, and some of the opinions of last term placed the justices in the center of the political debate. In addition, the court is still grappling behind the scenes with an investigation into the leak of the Dobbs draft. Although, in public, the justices continue to stress the importance of civility, last term\u2019s decisions showed new strains. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Voters looking to see their Senate candidates put to the test on a debate stage may only get one opportunity this fall, while others may be entirely out of luck. Debate participation \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 has become its own political weapon on the campaign trail, wielded by Democrats and Republicans alike as they accuse their opponents of avoiding public scrutiny or demanding ludicrous conditions. The debate over debates has confounded some veteran political strategists who say most competitive Senate contests are likely to be won on the margins this cycle, making it all the more important to reach as many voters as possible \u2013 both inside and beyond a candidate\u2019s base. While Republicans have numerous paths to retake the House in November, control of the Senate has proven a more difficult target amid candidate stumbles, cash shortfalls and intraparty bickering, even as the GOP needs to gain only one seat for a majority in the upper chamber. \u201cThere seems to be a bipartisan trend of candidates who are either hesitant to debate or the \u2018anytime, anywhere\u2019 doesn\u2019t happen. Tough talk on this may play to the base, but it looks awfully weak to independent voters if you can\u2019t debate at least once,\u201d said Doug Heye, a GOP strategist and former communications director for the Republican National Committee. Earlier this week, for example, Pennsylvania GOP Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz suggested his opponent John Fetterman was exploiting his recovery from a stroke to dodge the debate stage. The Democratic lieutenant governor has since said he will debate Oz, though nothing has been concretely planned. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Candidates in only two states so far have firmly agreed to meet face-to-face and field questions from a moderator, and even with those debates on the horizon in Colorado and Arizona, some of the candidates are still criticizing their opponents for declining additional debate invitations. While Republican Blake Masters and Democrat Mark Kelly have both accepted invitations to attend a Clean Elections/PBS debate on October 6, the Masters campaign continued to hammer away at Kelly on Thursday. \u201cMark Kelly declined an invitation to debate on CNN,\u201d said Katie Miller, a Masters adviser, who accused Kelly of wanting to \u201climit the time\u201d that he has to discuss his views on topics like immigration, LGBTQ issues, and rising crime in front of voters. Miller added, \u201cWe look forward to hearing more about those policies at the only debate Mark Kelly agreed to.\u201d A person familiar with the invitation said CNN recently invited both Kelly and Masters to debate on the network, but only Masters has accepted the invitation so far. Kelly spokesman Sarah Guggenheimer said the incumbent Democrat would be \u201ckeeping with Arizona tradition\u201d by participating in \u201cthe local Arizona-based televised debate.\u201d Some Senate candidates have agreed to participate in multiple debates or candidate forums before the November 8 election. The only problem? There\u2019s little overlap with the debates their opponents have agreed to. In August, Ohio Democrat Tim Ryan said he would participate in three debates ahead of the fall election, while Republican JD Vance has publicly agreed to two separate debates and privately accepted a third invitation that his campaign is waiting to reveal for now. \u201cOnce JD agrees to these three debates, Tim Ryan will debate JD any other time and place,\u201d Dave Chase, Ryan\u2019s campaign manager, said in August Text messages reviewed by CNN between both campaigns reveal just how tense the debate discussion has become in Ohio, where the Senate contest has been closer than most political observers expected. In them, a Ryan aide mentions the Democrat has agreed to three debates while Vance\u2019s team responds by affirming his commitment to a debate hosted by Nexstar Media Group. The Vance campaign later asserts that Ryan\u2019s team is taking an \u201cour way or the highway\u201d position. \u201cTeam Vance wants debates to happen but we\u2019re not going to be bullied by the Ryan camp,\u201d said a Vance adviser. Izzi Levy, a Ryan spokesperson, accused Vance of \u201cmaking up scheduling conflicts so he doesn\u2019t have to get on stage\u201d to explain his positions on topics like outsourcing and Big Pharma. Ryan \u201cis eager to debate JD Vance and has invited him to do so from the Mahoning Valley to the Miami Valley,\u201d Levy added. In some of the most competitive races this cycle, candidates have struggled to agree to even a single debate. In Georgia, incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and his Republican opponent Herschel Walker continue to fight over whether the two candidates will meet on the debate stage and the location if they do. After weeks of fighting back and forth in public, the dueling campaigns remain at an impasse. Warnock announced earlier this summer that he had accepted invitations to three separate televised debates in the fall, including debates in Macon, Atlanta and Savannah. His campaign ran a TV ad accusing Walker of \u201cdodging\u201d those three debate invitations after the Republican boasted he was \u201cready to go\u201d debate Warnock. Then, in early August, Walker said in an appearance with Fox News host Sean Hannity that he had agreed to participate in a debate on October 14 in Savannah, a separate event than the one Warnock had previously agreed to. That put the onus back on Warnock, whose campaign did not immediately respond to this proposal in public. Finally, on Wednesday, Warnock tweeted he would participate in the Oct. 14 Savannah debate, under the condition that Walker agree to one of the other previously announced debates, in either Macon or Atlanta \u2013 and that the debate hosts will not reveal the topics beforehand. Democrats have been eager to capitalize on Walker\u2019s propensity for making confusing comments about policy \u2013 a factor that Republicans have expressed particular concern about with their nominee. Responding on Twitter, Walker said he hoped to \u201clock down\u201d the Savannah debate but did not agree to a second debate nor to Warnock\u2019s condition about withholding debate topics. In Georgia Senate race, Walker and Warnock engage in debate over debates \u201cIt\u2019s time for Herschel Walker to stop playing games,\u201d said Quentin Fulks, Warnock\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cThe job of a U.S. Senator isn\u2019t one where you know the topics ahead of time or get a cheat sheet, and Herschel Walker shouldn\u2019t need one to find the courage to walk on a debate stage.\u201d A person familiar with the Republican candidate\u2019s thinking said Walker is not going to agree to another debate, effectively sending both candidates back to square one. Warnock\u2019s campaign aides view Walker\u2019s bluster on debates as yet another example of him not being fit for the United States Senate, routinely noting that he told reporters \u201cname the place and the time and we can get it on,\u201d but then demurred once Warnock\u2019s campaign did exactly that. \u201cReverend Warnock is hopeful that Herschel Walker will finally stop dodging debates and show voters if he\u2019s really ready to represent Georgia,\u201d said Fulks, Warnock\u2019s campaign manager. But even with the stepped-up pressure, Warnock campaign aides are growing concerned that Walker may not debate at all. Of course, debate dodging carries risks for Walker. The Macon Telegraph reported in August that even if Walker refuses to go to the Atlanta Press Club\u2019s event, the debate will go on and Walker will be represented by an empty lectern. There is precedent for this: During a Senate runoff in 2020, Sen. David Perdue refused to attend the Atlanta Press Club debate in December and Democrat Jon Ossoff spent the debate standing next to an empty podium. Perdue went on to lose the runoff. Meanwhile, some of the fiercest fighting over debates has unfolded in Pennsylvania, where an open Senate seat has pitted Fetterman, a progressive Democrat, against political novice Oz, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump. After suffering a stroke in May, Fetterman spent two months off the campaign trail and has only sparingly returned in recent weeks. During his break from campaigning, Fetterman\u2019s team pilloried Oz as an out-of-state conservative who just recently moved to Pennsylvania to run for Senate, a series of attacks that worried Republicans and caught the Oz campaign flat footed. To change the conversation, the Oz campaign has gone on the offense over the fact that Fetterman declined to attend a series of debates, making it central to their message against the Pennsylvania Democrat. The strategy has received some scorn, especially for the way Oz\u2019s campaign aides have, at times, mocked Fetterman\u2019s health, but it has allowed Oz to go on the attack. Oz ratchets up questions about Fetterman's health as Pennsylvania Senate race gets acrimonious On Wednesday, after weeks of attacks, Fetterman said in a statement that he always intended to debate Oz and that the hold-up has \u201conly ever been about addressing some of the lingering issues of my stroke, the auditory processing, and we\u2019re going to be able to work that out.\u201d His comments came on the heels of an editorial by his hometown newspaper, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, that raised questions about his \u201cability to serve\u201d in Congress if he was avoiding \u201cthe give-and-take of a vigorous debate.\u201d Fetterman has not provided specifics over when and where he is open to a debate, leading the Oz campaign to lambast Fetterman for agreeing to a \u201csecret debate.\u201d The Democrat has said he is looking at sometime \u201cin the middle to end of October.\u201d Down South, North Carolina Senate hopefuls Ted Budd and Cheri Beasley have also sparred over the debate question. Beasley, the Democrat, agreed to a mid-October debate in August, but Budd\u2019s team has yet to respond and recently asked for an extension on their decision. Top Beasley campaign aides have maintained that they are ready and open to debating Budd, but one aide noted that the Republican refused to go to any primary Senate debates, suggesting he might skip the debate stage during the general election, too. \u201cOur posture has been, we are open to debating, we have agreed to this debate, we need to see what Ted Budd is going to do,\u201d said a Beasley aide. When asked whether they had made a decision to attend any general election debates, Budd campaign aide Jonathan Felts told CNN \u201cnot yet.\u201d Similar impasses have arisen in Nevada, Florida and Wisconsin. After Republican Adam Laxalt won the Republican Senate primary in June, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto agreed to three debates. Ignoring that trio of debates, Laxalt wrote on Twitter in August that he had instead agreed to two statewide televised debates hosted by local television stations and was continuing \u201cto consider other debate invites.\u201d Laxalt spokeswoman Courtney Holland pointed to the Republican candidate\u2019s previous comments, noting that Cortez Masto has not agreed to the two debates Laxalt proposed and accusing the Democratic incumbent of \u201chiding from her constituents.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s clear Laxalt can\u2019t defend his record and wants to avoid being held accountable on the debate stage,\u201d said Josh Marcus-Blank, a Cortez Masto campaign spokesman. In Wisconsin, representatives for both incumbent GOP Sen. Ron Johnson and his Democratic opponent Mandela Barnes are still in the planning stages. A Johnson aide said the campaign was close to reaching a deal but would not provide additional details. And in Florida, a statewide coordinator for the long-running \u201cBefore You Vote\u201d debates, Ron Sachs, told the Orlando Sentinel on Tuesday that Republican Sen. Marco Rubio and his opponent, Democrat Rep. Val Demings, had committed to an October 18 debate to be broadcast in the state\u2019s 10 major media markets. It is the only debate both candidates have reportedly agreed to so far, though neither has explicitly acknowledged that publicly. \u201cThis race is about a cop on the beat taking on a career politician who doesn\u2019t show up for work,\u201d said Christian Slater, Demings\u2019 communications director. \u201cWe look forward to making that choice clear to voters on the debate stage and will have further details soon.\u201d Rubio spokeswoman Elizabeth Gregory declined to confirm the October debate, saying in a statement the Florida senator \u201clooks forward to contrasting his record of getting things done for Florida with [Demings\u2019] record of voting with Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misattributed texts to the Vance campaign.

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday called on President Joe Biden to apologize for invoking fascism to describe the ideology of former President Donald Trump and his supporters. McCarthy made the remarks during a prebuttal speech ahead of the President\u2019s prime-time address later in the evening. The speech from the House GOP leader marks an effort to counter the President\u2019s message \u2013 ahead of the 2022 midterms as Republicans fight to win back control of the House of Representatives. \u201cPresident Biden has chosen to divide, demean, and disparage his fellow Americans \u2013 Why? simply because they disagree with his policies,\u201d McCarthy said in his speech. \u201cThat is not leadership.\u201d \u201cWhen the President speaks tonight at Independence Hall, the first lines out of his mouth should be to apologize for slandering tens of millions of Americans as \u2018fascists,\u2019\u201d McCarthy said. Biden has likened the philosophy that underpins Trump and those who have stood by him to \u201csemi-facism\u201d \u2013 comments that Republicans have seized on to criticize the President. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is either the beginning or the death knell of an extreme MAGA philosophy,\u201d Biden recently told a group of Democratic donors at a private home in Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Trump,\u201d he went on, \u201cit\u2019s the entire philosophy that underpins the \u2013 I\u2019m going to say something: It\u2019s like semi-fascism.\u201d McCarthy also used his remarks to broadly criticize Democratic control of Congress and the Biden White House, arguing that Americans are struggling and that Democrats are not delivering. The House minority leader said in his speech he\u2019d spoken to Americans who felt Biden and Democrats\u2019 policies were making their lives harder. He suggested a Republican majority in Congress could be the solution. \u201cWhat is clear to me and clear to you is that Washington and the White House aren\u2019t listening. They just don\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur best days are ahead of us not behind us. Our nation can flourish again and under a new historic Republican majority, it will. For the past two years have been a time of trial for Americans everywhere.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the past two years, Joe Biden has launched an assault on the soul of America, on its people, on its laws, on its most sacred values. He has launched an assault on our democracy. His policies have severely wounded America\u2019s soul, diminished America\u2019s spirit and betrayed America\u2019s trust.\u201d McCarthy spoke about Republican stances on immigration, drug addiction, Covid-19 mandates, and education, among other issues. At one point, McCarthy addressed democracy in the United States, an issue Democrats often bring up against Republicans in relation to Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. McCarthy also suggested the FBI search of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property was politically motivated, which the Department of Justice has repeatedly denied. \u201cJoe Biden often says our democracy is under threat. He\u2019s right, but not for the reason he thinks,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cJoe Biden and a politicized DOJ launched a raid on the home of his top political rival, Donald Trump. That is an assault on democracy.\u201d McCarthy concluded his speech offering Republicans\u2019 messaging ahead of the 2022 midterms. \u201cRepublicans have a plan for a new direction that will get our country back on track. Our plan is our commitment to America,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Republicans are given the opportunity and honor to have a majority in the House, we will work day and night, hour after hour for you, the people.\u201d Biden is expected to use his speech to reinforce the offensive against extremism in the Republican Party that he has recently made a focus of his messaging as he seeks to tie GOP candidates to his White House predecessor, framing the midterms as a second round against Trump. The key battleground state of Pennsylvania is serving as the backdrop for both speeches. McCarthy\u2019s speech took place in Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton, while Biden will speak from Philadelphia. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "It was a referendum. Now it\u2019s a choice. For political professionals in both parties, that\u2019s the capsule explanation for why the Democratic position in the midterm elections appears to have improved so much since summer began. When the election looked to be primarily a referendum on the performance of the Democrats who control the White House and Congress, Republicans were optimistic that a towering \u201cred wave\u201d would carry them to sweeping gains in November. But with evidence suggesting more voters are treating the election as a comparative choice between the two parties, operatives on both sides are bracing for a closely contested outcome that could include an unusual divergence in results for the House and those in Senate and governor races. \u201cIt feels to me to be more like a shallow red puddle that we\u2019re walking through, rather than a tsunami of sorts,\u201d says Republican strategist John Thomas. The key to the change in expectations is a shift in the issues motivating the electorate. Earlier this year, the debate between the parties centered on inflation, the economy, crime, immigration and President Joe Biden\u2019s stalled legislative agenda in Congress \u2013 all issues that motivated the Republican base and alienated many swing voters from Democrats. But a series of dramatic events over the past few months have elevated an entirely different set of issues: gun violence, threats to democracy, climate change and, above all, abortion rights. The effect has been the political equivalent to one weather system displacing another. Some Republicans try to shift positions on abortion as general election approaches While the focus on the economy and crime encouraged voters to simply grade the performance of the party in power \u2013 the classic \u201creferendum election\u201d frame \u2013 the new concerns have highlighted stark differences between the two parties and defined the election more as a choice between antithetical directions for the nation. That new frame has both energized Democratic base voters who earlier appeared disenchanted or tuned out and reminded many swing voters why they have recoiled from the Donald Trump-era Republican Party. While midterm elections are normally \u201ca referendum on incumbents and economic reality \u2026 we are not in normal times,\u201d says Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, vice president and chief strategy officer of Way to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color. \u201cRepublicans have embraced this Trump-ism, these brazen assaults on our freedoms and our families and are rejecting the policies voters actually want. That [creates] an opportunity for us to re-turnout our surge voters from 2018 and to move conflicted voters over.\u201d The new focus on issues such as gun violence, threats to democracy and abortion has not erased the threats to congressional Democrats from the public\u2019s mostly negative assessments about the economy, or its enduring concern about crime. But to a far greater extent than earlier this year, it has provided Democratic campaigns an opportunity to shift the campaign discussion from how voters feel about Biden\u2019s performance to whether they support the direction Republicans would take the country, especially since the GOP nominated so many Senate and governor candidates who have unreservedly embraced Trump. \u201cThe conditions have changed, and we have to step into that and tell this story as clearly as we can,\u201d says Fernandez Ancona. \u201cWe need voters to see the midterm as a crossroads, not a referendum.\u201d Democratic hopes of avoiding the worst in November will likely pivot on whether they can successfully convince enough voters, particularly voters in their presidential-year coalition who might otherwise skip a midterm election, to see the contest in those terms. An NBC poll released last week, conducted by the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies and the Democratic firm led by Peter Hart and Geoff Garin, captured the rare split screen dynamic that\u2019s reshaping the campaign. When the pollsters asked respondents to identify their top concerns in the midterm election, they found an unusually wide separation between voters in each party\u2019s coalition. \u201cIt is a really unusual election,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. \u201cRepublicans have significant advantages on their set of issues (inflation, economy, crime, border security) and Democrats enjoy significant advantages on issues of concern to their voters (abortion, climate change, guns, health care). There is no overlap, no competitive issues. This means each party has an unusual opportunity to try to create their own narrative to their own voters on what this election is about.\u201d The poll found that significant numbers of voters remain focused on the issues that dominated the debate earlier this year, and that those voters backed Republicans by wide margins for Congress. Nearly three-fifths of voters who cited the cost of living as one of their top two concerns in the survey preferred Republicans, as did about three-fifths of those focused on crime, two-thirds of those who raised the economy, and nearly 9-in-10 of those who identified immigration as a principal concern, according to detailed results provided by POS. But Democrats, uncommonly, had comparable advantages on a different set of issues that cumulatively ranked as top-two priorities for nearly as many voters as the concerns that advantaged Republicans. In the survey, Democrats won about two-thirds of voters focused on either gun violence or threats to democracy, over 7-in-10 of those who cited abortion, and more than 8-in-10 who identified climate change. All of these issues have gained in prominence since the spring: gun violence since the Ulvade, Texas, massacre, abortion since the Supreme Court decision that overturned the national right to the procedure, threats to democracy amid the disclosures of the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection and the revelations about Trump\u2019s mishandling of classified material, and climate since the unexpected passage of the Democrats\u2019 slimmed down reconciliation bill. That increased visibility represents the new weather system that has at least partially pushed aside the dark clouds of inflation and economic discontent that hung over Democrats for most of this year. \u201cThe conversation in the nation has changed,\u201d says Michael Podhorzer, former chief political adviser to the AFL-CIO and chair of the Analyst Institute, a collaborative of progressive groups that conducts extensive public polling. \u201cIn 2021, the conversation was about what Democrats were or were not doing \u2013 inflation, Afghanistan, crime \u2013 the classic context for a party-in-power rout. Since June, the conversation has shifted to what returning Republicans to power would mean.\u201d That shift in the conversation, he argues, is \u201creminding the 81 million people who voted against Trump in 2020\u201d about why they turned out to oppose him and increasing the odds that more of them will show up again in 2022. The Way to Win group is arguing that Democrats should crystallize the new issues rising in prominence into a straightforward but sharp message: Americans need to vote for Democrats to \u201cprotect our freedoms\u201d against \u201cTrump Republicans [who] want to take away freedom from all who do not look, live, and love like them.\u201d Abortion is an especially powerful symbol of that idea, Fernandez Ancona says. \u201cWe have even heard people in focus groups say, \u2018prices go up and down, but I can\u2019t prevent myself from being raped and not being able to have an abortion,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that something everyone had is now being taken away is so strong it\u2019s overriding\u201d other concerns. Like many GOP strategists, Thomas believes economic assessments ultimately will motivate more voters than abortion. But he agrees the campaign no longer revolves solely around the economy. \u201cThe Republicans only hope to regain a wave is if there is a uniting singular issue that refocused all voters\u201d and concentrated discontent with Biden\u2019s performance, the way inflation did earlier this year, he said. \u201cBut right now, with this split in the electorate, there\u2019s not one big thing that the voters are unanimously going, \u2018Screw those guys, I want to blame somebody,\u2019\u201d Thomas added. \u201cThe fragmentation really has benefited the Democrats.\u201d Many analysts believe that the traditional referendum dynamics may prove most powerful in House races, while many Senate and governor\u2019s races already show signs of evolving into much more of a choice kind of election. \u201cThe difference in statewide races is that the voters know the candidates better and so a combination of good candidates [running against] bad candidates are better able to transcend national tides,\u201d says Garin, the Democratic pollster. By contrast, Garin notes, \u201cHouse races in some ways are more parliamentary in nature\u201d \u2013meaning that they turn less on assessments of the individual candidates, who are often not that well defined for voters, than on broader views about the two parties and conditions in the country. The clearest measure of the increasingly parliamentary nature of House races over the past several decades has been the tightening correlation between voters\u2019 attitudes toward a president and their willingness to vote for House candidates from his party. As I\u2019ve written, in exit polls, the share of voters who disapprove of a president\u2019s performance and vote against congressional candidates from his party has increased from about 75% in the late 1980s, to over 80% from the 1990s through the early 2000s, to fully 90% by 2018. But in multiple polls this year, Republican congressional candidates are not drawing nearly that much support from voters who disapprove of Biden. That\u2019s a measure of resistance to the Trump-era GOP even among voters disenchanted with the Democrats\u2019 performance. Particularly noteworthy is that a recent Pew Research Center survey found congressional Democrats leading among voters who somewhat disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance, while the NBC survey found them essentially breaking even with those voters. That\u2019s a remarkable divergence from recent experience: the opposition party won about two-thirds of voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump in 2018 and former President Barack Obama in 2010, according to exit poll results provided by the CNN polling unit. These dynamics (along with a slight but perceptible rise in Biden\u2019s approval rating) help explain why some independent analysts, such as the Cook Political Report, have lowered their expectations on the number of seats Republicans may gain in November. But even so, the tendency of voters dissatisfied with the president to back the opposition party in House elections is strong enough that most analysts still believe Republicans can gain enough seats to capture the majority (even if, for the first time, some Democratic analysts see a path to defying the usual midterm history and maintaining control). It\u2019s in higher-profile Senate and governor\u2019s races that the new issue dynamics are creating the greatest opportunity for Democrats to rise above general discontent over the country\u2019s direction. With their greater visibility, those races, as Garin noted, are inherently more of a choice. And, at least for now, multiple statewide Democratic candidates facing Trump-endorsed opponents are running strongly and drawing support that considerably exceeds Biden\u2019s approval rating in their states. Races that now fit that description include the Senate contests in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and Ohio, as well as governor\u2019s races in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona. Democrats are far from guaranteed victory in any of those races. But in all of them, they have fortified their position by shifting the campaign focus from discontent over Biden\u2019s performance and inflation to the personal and ideological vulnerabilities of their GOP opponents, particularly their hardline stances against abortion. \u201cIn the House you can have a candidate who can\u2019t put three sentences together and no one finds out,\u201d says Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do that in a Senate race. There\u2019s too much money that\u2019s spent, there\u2019s too much coverage. The governor races [are] the same thing.\u201d If House races unfold as more of a referendum, and statewide contests play out more like a choice, that creates the possibility of an unusual divergence in the midterm result. Almost always, the party that wins House seats in a midterm also gains Senate seats, and for that matter, adds governorships. Since World War II, the party that gained House seats simultaneously lost Senate seats only in 2018, 1970 and 1962. Over that nearly eight-decade span, no party ever gained House seats and simultaneously lost ground in both the Senate and governor\u2019s races. Yet a November outcome in which Republicans add only a modest number of House seats and fail to gain ground, or even lose some, in Senate and governor\u2019s contests, no longer seems impossible. All the dynamics boosting Republicans this year haven\u2019t disappeared. But they are no longer the only forces shaping the campaign atmosphere. And that could mean the midterm election produces far more of a split decision than almost anyone considered possible earlier this year.",

            "article_content": "Arizona Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters removed language from his website following his primary win that included the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump, along with a section arguing the country would be better off if Trump was still the president. A review of Masters\u2019 website by CNN\u2019s KFile showed he also removed controversial language saying Democrats were trying to \u201cimport\u201d a new electorate \u2013 language that has drawn fire for mirroring far-right conspiracies that Democrats are trying to weaken the power of native-born Americans of European descent through mass immigration of non-White immigrants. Arizona GOP Senate candidate attempts to soften anti-abortion stance in pivot to general election Both stances were on Masters\u2019 website on August 1, the day before he won the Republican primary to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in the closely watched Senate race. The sections were gone by August 26, according to screenshots from the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. Masters\u2019s new campaign posturing comes as a flurry of Republican candidates nationwide attempt to distance themselves from unpopular or divisive policy positions, particularly about abortion and the legitimacy of the 2020 election, ahead of the midterm election this November. NBC News first reported last week that Masters attempted to tone down his position on abortion by removing from his website his support of a \u201cfederal personhood law\u201d and a several other strict anti-abortion positions while releasing a video in which the Republican nominee took a softer stance on the issue. Election deniers take over CPAC after primary victories A person close to Masters told CNN last week that the Republican candidate designs, codes and updates his website himself \u2013 and that his recent updates to the abortion section reflect his desire to use his policy section as a \u201cliving document\u201d rather than an immutable record of his positions. It\u2019s unusual for candidates to update their issues pages on major issues, and CNN has reached out to Masters\u2019 campaign about the modified language about the 2020 election. In early August, the page \u201cThe Masters Plan,\u201d read, \u201cWe need to get serious about election integrity. The 2020 election was a rotten mess \u2013 if we had had a free and fair election, President Trump would be sitting in the Oval Office today and America would be so much better off.\u201d The page now only says, \u201cWe need to get serious about election integrity.\u201d In another section of Masters\u2019 website regarding immigration, Masters wrote, \u201cJoe Biden and Mark Kelly caused this crisis. They canceled the Border Wall construction. They invite illegals to come here and give them housing and cash. The Democrats dream of mass amnesty, because they want to import a new electorate.\u201d Masters removed the last line, which nods to the great replacement conspiracy theory. Masters\u2019 website was removed from the Web Archive temporarily at his request, according to a spokesperson for the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. Any person can request their content be removed from the Wayback Machine and Internet users flagged its removal on Friday following NBC\u2019s report. Though the removal sparked cries that Masters was trying to hide changes to his campaign website, the exclusion of his page was actually requested in 2018 before he was a candidate. \u201cBlake Masters sent us a request to exclude blakemasters.com from the Wayback Machine in 2018, well prior to his campaign,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe were not aware he would become a candidate for public office and excluded the site. We have presently re-enabled access to archives of the site for the time period after Masters\u2019 campaign became public.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes are political opposites. But as the two prepare for what could become one of the most closely watched Senate races of the 2022 cycle, they are leveling similar attacks to define each other: Casting their opponent as too extreme and out of touch with Wisconsin voters, while arguing the other is not a true representative of the state\u2019s working class. \u201cThe problem is Ron Johnson has turned his back on working people and I\u2019ve fought for working people my entire career, even before I was an office,\u201d Barnes said when asked for the single biggest difference between himself and Johnson, who made millions running a plastics manufacturer before he entered public office. \u201cHis wealth isn\u2019t the problem \u2013 it\u2019s the fact that he is ultra-wealthy and out of touch.\u201d Johnson\u2019s campaign declined to make him available to CNN, but a Johnson campaign adviser previewed a notably similar message. \u201c(Barnes) is out of touch with where the majority of the state is,\u201d said adviser Ben Voelkel, citing some of the more liberal positions Barnes has backed throughout his career. \u201cMandela Barnes talks a lot about his dad working the third shift work. \u2026 Mandela Barnes hasn\u2019t done any of that. He has been a career political activist.\u201d Johnson has already described Barnes as Democrats\u2019 \u201cmost radical left candidate,\u201d adding that \u201ca radical left Senator from Wisconsin is not the solution.\u201d Johnson recently called him \u201ca progressive puppet out to fundamentally change America.\u201d The attacks \u2013 delivered ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Wisconsin Senate primaries, which appear to be already decided \u2013 are previews of what will likely become an acrimonious race, one that experts expect will see tens of millions spent on negative advertising as each side attempts to solidify their base voters in November. Johnson, the incumbent, faces no primary challenge after he opted to run for a third term. The senator, who promised to only serve another full term when he ran for reelection in 2016, waffled on the third term for months, but eventually decided to get into the race because \u201cAmerica is in peril\u201d and he wants to end Democratic control of Washington. Barnes initially had significant primary challengers, including Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who spent more than $11 million of his own money airing ads throughout the state. But over the span of a week last month, Barnes\u2019 three top primary opponents \u2013 Lasry, Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson \u2013 all dropped out of the race and endorsed the lieutenant governor, effectively ending the primary. \u201cI could not have imagined it ending up this way,\u201d Barnes told CNN. \u201cTo me, it shows just how important beating Ron Johnson is, just how important expanding the democratic majority is.\u201d As the two candidates turn their focus on each other, Wisconsin represents yet another example of a high stakes Senate race where the contrast between candidates is significant, including Republican Herschel Walker vs. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia, Republican Mehmet Oz against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and Republican Blake Masters vs. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona. The Barnes strategy is to define Johnson as a changed man, someone who went to Washington as an insurgent candidate but then enmeshed himself into the Republican Party led by former President Donald Trump. The attacks will include Johnson\u2019s own admission that the 2017 tax bill passed by Republicans in Washington benefited his own company; his reported role in attempting to push a slate of fake electors after the 2020 election; and his more recent suggestion that Social Security and Medicare, two popular social spending programs, be changed from mandatory to discretionary spending, something experts argue could effectively end the programs. \u201cWhat we ought to be doing is we ought to turn everything into discretionary spending so that it\u2019s all evaluated so that we can fix problems or fix programs that are broken that are going to be going bankrupt,\u201d Johnson said earlier this month. Barnes wasted no time jumping on the comment, using it to argue that Johnson\u2019s personal wealth makes it impossible for him to understand what these programs mean to working class people. \u201cIf he wants be anti-Social Security, that\u2019s on him,\u201d Barnes told CNN, using the Johnson comment to inoculate himself from Republican charges of being too extreme. \u201cThat\u2019s much more extreme than wanting working families and people all across Wisconsin have a fair shot.\u201d With the primary all but decided, Barnes put out an attack ad earlier this month that hit Johnson on outsourcing jobs, using the senator\u2019s defense of a company that took jobs out of Wisconsin. \u201cRon Johnson couldn\u2019t be more out of touch with Wisconsin,\u201d the ad says. Democrats are also preparing to paint Johnson as a candidate who has become a conspiracy theory promoter, including questioning the push to vaccinate people against the coronavirus, calling climate change \u201cbullsh*t,\u201d and suggesting \u2013 without any evidence \u2013 that the FBI had more inside knowledge than it let on about the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021. Republican operatives working on Senate campaigns acknowledged the impact some of Johnson\u2019s comments have had on his image. A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 46% of Wisconsin voters viewed him unfavorably, compared to 37% who had a favorable view. But one operative argued that some positive Johnson messaging over the summer, including significant spending by an outside group focused on inflation and a Johnson campaign ad focus on legislation that allowed for more experimental drug treatments, have done some rehabilitation. \u201cHis numbers are moving in the right direction,\u201d the operative said, adding that, no matter what, \u201cit is going to be a close race.\u201d Democrats see negative views of Johnson as central to their plan of turning the general election into a referendum of the senator. \u201cRon Johnson is, without a doubt, the most vulnerable Republican incumbent on the map,\u201d said Amanda Sherman Baity, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The attacks on Barnes center on accusations that he is too extreme for the state, using his time as a community organizer, a state assemblyman from a solidly Democratic district and a \u201clongtime leader\u201d in the Working Families Party against him as he runs for Senate. The hits include his ties to members of the \u201cSquad,\u201d a group of liberal lawmakers in Congress who are often attacked by Republicans; a photo taken of him holding up an \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d T-shirt; and positions like ending cash bail, supporting the Green New Deal and a host of other views the Johnson campaign believes are too \u201cextreme\u201d for Wisconsin voters. Barnes has said he does not support abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement but supports \u201caddressing the concerns and issues and challenges that people have so that we can have a fair, comprehensive immigration reform system.\u201d \u201cAll of these things are positions that might get you applause at a Working Families Party rally or get you the endorsement of AOC or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but when you look across the state, that is not where 50+1 of the state sits,\u201d Voelkel said. One issue that Barnes\u2019 campaign must confront is the fact that polls show that many Wisconsin voters don\u2019t know enough about him to have an opinion \u2013 something that can be both helpful and hurtful. \u201cBarnes is not nearly as known in the state as Johnson,\u201d said Charles Franklin, pollster for the Marquette Law School poll, citing a recent poll that found over 50% of Democratic primary voters didn\u2019t know enough about the lieutenant governor to form an opinion. \u201cThat is an opportunity for the Johnson side \u2026 to really try to step in and define Barnes.\u201d And they plan to do just that, with the Johnson campaign and outside groups already gearing up to cast Barnes as out of step with most Wisconsin voters. \u201cHe is going to be defined by all these left-wing positions that he took in the past,\u201d said Jack Pandol, spokesman for Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC focused on Senate races. \u201cThere is a lot that voters are going to be made aware of in the coming months and that will be the first information that some voters are getting about Barnes.\u201d Barnes responded to these attacks by saying Republicans \u201ctried to say the same thing about Tammy Baldwin,\u201d and she went on to win the state\u2019s other Senate seat in 2012 and reelection in 2018. \u201cPeople like Ron Johnson are going to lie about whatever, anything he can think of, to take the heat off his own bad behavior,\u201d he said. The question among experts in Wisconsin is whether, after years of polarization and remarkably tight elections, there are even enough persuadable voters in the state to make the general election anything more than a base-focused race. Wisconsin has been a swing state for years. When Trump won it in 2016, he was the first Republican to win it since 1984. While Biden won the state back in 2020, the state has long had years of Republican governors, including Scott Walker from 2011 to 2019, and Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature. \u201cWe were polarized before it was cool,\u201d said Joe Zepecki, a Democratic operative in Wisconsin, arguing that the fights around union rights in 2011 and 2012 led to the state being deeply polarized long before the arrival of Donald Trump. \u201cSo that shrinking segment of swing voters is kind of the ball game. Yes, the political environment may be bad, but Republicans\u2019 brand is rotten with those voters.\u201d This is why political watchers like Franklin and others expect a deluge of negative ads in the contest, with both sides running campaigns that \u201creflect that polarization that we have had for a good 12 years.\u201d Democrats are confident that if they can turn the race into a referendum on Johnson, there are enough votes who have backed him in the past who are ready for an alternative. \u201cThere is absolutely a world of ticket splitters, a world of persuadable voters and a world of people who might or might turn out,\u201d said Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Democrats do, however, face a difficult national environment, with President Joe Biden\u2019s poll numbers slumping and voters across the country skeptical of Democratic leadership in Washington. With this in mind, Barnes argued it would be Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers \u2013 not the president \u2013 who would have the most direct impact on the contest. Evers himself is up for reelection. While he did not have a primary challenge, he will likely face a tough race against whoever emerges from what has been a tight Republican primary race on Tuesday. \u201cThis is a very Wisconsin focused race,\u201d he said, citing a recent poll that found 48% of Wisconsin voters approved of Evers. \u201cI would say that people know the work that we\u2019ve been doing here in state and this race isn\u2019t going to be determined about what people think about national politics.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Republican Party\u2019s nominee for Maryland attorney general hosted a series of five radio shows in 2006 devoted to arguing in support of 9/11 conspiracy theories questioning if the terror attack was the work of an \u201celite bureaucrat\u201d who had demolition charges in every building in New York City and even suggesting if those who died after a hijacked plane hit the Pentagon were killed elsewhere. Michael Peroutka, a candidate best known for his ties to neo-Confederate organizations, made the remarks on The American View, a radio show he co-hosted, in October 2006 while discussing the fifth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack. \u201cWhat happened on 9-1-1, I told you that I had been doing some research and watching some videos,\u201d Peroutka said during one of the episodes reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cAnd I said that if the buildings in New York City, the World Trade Center buildings, came down by demolition charges \u2013 that is to say \u2013 if there was this evidence that there was that something was preset there, then the implications of that are massive,\u201d said Peroutka. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some reading and doing some studying, and I believe that to be very, very true,\u201d he added, before further suggesting the work was done by controlled explosives. \u201cThe other thing that just is so striking to me, I can\u2019t get it out of my brain, and that is the vision of Building 7 falling faster than the speed of gravity, right? Building 7, which no plane hit,\u201d said Peroutka. \u201cAnd all of a sudden Building 7 falls, very consistent with what they call controlled demolitions or controlled charges because that building from the top down falls faster than if you had thrown a hammer off the top of the building.\u201d Peroutka\u2019s comments echo the widely debunked conspiracy theory that the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center, the smaller building within the vicinity of the towers, were wired with explosives and detonated in a series of controlled demolitions. The Twin Towers collapsed after terrorist-hijacked planes intentionally crashed into the North Tower and then the South Tower, killing 2,753 people. Nearby \u201cBuilding 7\u201d suffered intense and uncontrollable fires after debris from the North Tower hit the building, causing a chain reaction that led to the building\u2019s collapse, according to a study published in 2008 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Peroutka went even further with his conspiratorial logic, speculating that every building in New York City could have preset charges awaiting detonation by some \u201celite bureaucrat.\u201d \u201cThat begs the question that if there are preset charges in Building Seven, what\u2019s to stop there for being preset charges in Buildings 1, 2 8, 9, and 27?\u201d said Peroutka. \u201cAre there charges in every building in New York City? Is everyone ready to be brought down whenever some elite bureaucrat decides that he\u2019s gonna pull it?\u201d Peroutka also called the 9/11 terrorist attacks an \u201cinside job,\u201d saying \u201cyou can\u2019t have an explosion in the basement that\u2019s done by the hijacker on the airplane\u201d and claimed that the official account of the 9/11 attack was the real \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d The campaign did not address Peroutka\u2019s previous conspiracy theories when asked for comment, but Macky Stafford, Petroutka\u2019s campaign coordinator, told CNN in a statement that the \u201cprimary election results demonstrate that Maryland Republicans are dissatisfied with their current leadership.\u201d But outgoing Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan called out Peroutka on Sunday, saying, \u201cThese disgusting lies don\u2019t belong in our party.\u201d \u201cWe know who was responsible for 9/11. Blaming our country for Al-Qaeda\u2019s atrocities is an insult to the memory of the thousands of innocent Americans and brave first responders who died that day,\u201d Hogan tweeted. Peroutka previously ran for president in 2004 as the nominee of the Constitution Party. During that campaign, Peroutka posted on his website an endorsement from the League of the South \u2013 a new-Confederate organization that advocates southern secession. The homepage for his campaign prominently featured a Confederate flag linking to \u201cSoutherners for Peroutka\u201d whose homepage had a large Confederate flag displayed over the Capitol saying, \u201cWe have a dream.\u201d He also promoted his candidacy to the Council of Conservative Citizens, according to copies of their newsletter obtained by CNN. The CCC is a self-described White-rights group that opposes non-White immigration and advances White nationalist ideology. Peroutka will face Democratic Rep. Anthony Brown in the general election this November. If elected, Brown would be the first Black attorney general in the state. Maryland has not had a Republican attorney general since 1952, when one was appointed; the last Republican attorney general elected in the state was in 1919. In other episodes of Peroutka\u2019s radio show reviewed by CNN\u2019s KFile, Peroutka also cast doubt that the Pentagon was hit by American Airlines Flight 77, asking where the video is showing this \u201cincoming attack, plane or missile,\u201d later saying that it is \u201cvery plausible that a missile that looked like a plane hit the Pentagon.\u201d Peroutka even questioned if remains of the deceased were found at the Pentagon, suggesting they were killed elsewhere. He said he had seen \u201cno evidence\u201d of any bodies or luggage to his late co-host and former presidential campaign adviser, John Lofton. Lofton said, \u201cAh, but see the missile thing. Then you gotta count for the remains and the body parts and show how all those people got inside the missile. How all those passengers\u2013\u201d \u201cI saw the pictures. There was, there was nothing that looked like a body or luggage or anything in there,\u201d Peroutka interrupted. \u201cAnd the pictures that I saw \u2013 if there are pictures, John \u2013 that show body parts or luggage or even a seat of an airplane that\u2019s consistent with Flight 77, that particular airplane. If there\u2019s anything that\u2019s consistent with that, I haven\u2019t seen a picture of it.\u201d Shortly after, Lofton said, \u201cIf I can produce for you a person who was a friend or loved one of one of the passengers that perished on that plane that hit the Pentagon, that says, \u2018Yes, we got remains back from our loved one or friend.\u2019 Will that impress you?\u201d \u201cNo, absolutely not,\u201d replied Peroutka. \u201cWhere did the remains come from? I\u2019m not disputing that the people died.\u201d \u201cUnless a plane hit the Pentagon, how would the remains of anybody on that flight get into the Pentagon?\u201d asked Lofton. \u201cI didn\u2019t say they got into the Pentagon. I couldn\u2019t see them in the Pentagon. There wasn\u2019t any \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen any evidence that anything like a body or a passenger or passenger\u2019s luggage or anything that\u2019s consistent with the Flight 77 is in the Pentagon. If there are such pictures, I\u2019d like to see them. Now, you could clearly understand that somebody whose loved one was lost on that plane, very possibly, could have gotten some piece of forensic evidence that indicated that their loved one was in fact deceased. But who says that came from the Pentagon?\u201d Peroutka then said this was the first time he had heard that the remains of the deceased were found at the Pentagon. American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked by five terrorists on September 11, 2001, and deliberately crashed into the Pentagon, killing all 64 people aboard and another 125 people in the building.

            "article_content": "Seized by genuine panic about the prospect of Republicans winning control of Congress and governors\u2019 mansions across the country, multiple Democratic leaders and candidates in some of the tightest races are calling on party leaders \u2013 including President Joe Biden \u2013 to focus on calling out Republicans as \u201cextremists.\u201d They don\u2019t think Biden\u2019s poll numbers are going to go up much or inflation is going to go down much. But in the continuing wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and with hundreds of election deniers on the ballot across the country, many Democratic leaders are looking to reframe the stakes of the midterms around a GOP they say has become a threat to America \u2013 arguing that Republican control in states and in Congress would lead to a federal abortion ban, major rights restrictions, and attacks on democracy which could endanger the 2024 presidential election. \u201cDemocrats would be irresponsible, both morally and politically, if we just went with the same poll-tested stuff about delivering infrastructure,\u201d said Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, who is helping craft some of the strategy in the Senate to press Republicans. \u201cThere\u2019s a place for all of that, but these people are out of their minds and are really acting with impunity, and we need to say so.\u201d In races for governor, Senate, attorney general, House and state legislatures, the goal is to win over the prototypical suburban, college-educated, generally female, swing voters \u2013 like those in Virginia who were solidly for Biden in 2020, but largely drifted to Republican Glenn Youngkin in the 2021 governor\u2019s race. But it\u2019s also to appeal to Republican voters who see Donald Trump and Trumpism as toxic, despite the former President\u2019s return to Washington on Tuesday in the run-up to an expected new campaign announcement. CNN Poll: 75% of Democratic voters want someone other than Biden in 2024 As one top Democratic strategist working on House races summed up the argument after reviewing internal focus group data which shows a stronger and more lasting than expected resonance to recent Republican moves, particularly around abortion policy: \u201cI understand that you\u2019re frustrated, everything sucks \u2013 but that person thinks that you can\u2019t get pregnant from rape, that person believes in QAnon. \u2026 I know you don\u2019t like Democrats \u2013 but do you actually want to vote for that person?\u201d Between Biden\u2019s sagging poll numbers and talk of a looming recession, Republicans see all the traditional makings of a midterm romp. Just about every poll shows the economy and inflation remain the top voter concern, leading one Republican campaign operative to dismiss Democratic efforts to talk about extremism as \u201cscreaming into the wind.\u201d Still, many top Democrats believe focusing on Republicans is their best shot. The strategy is already being set in motion. Last week in the House, Democrats brought bills to the floor in an effort to force Republicans to vote against legalized same-sex marriage and the right to birth control. Most Republicans did just that. Senate Democrats are bringing the same-sex marriage vote forward, and many Republicans in the chamber are agonizing over what to do. More votes are planned on social issues, but also on measures like the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, which Senate Democrats put on the floor shortly after the Buffalo supermarket shooting. The Democratic National Committee is coordinating with state parties on ads and local press tours built around words like \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cthreatening,\u201d and highlighting what they call \u201cMAGA Hot Mic\u201d moments around Republican officials making hardline comments about abortion, democracy and guns. Democratic groups have also primed a barrage of opposition research to release on GOP candidates on everything from once-obscure bills introduced in state legislatures to long-ago Facebook comments, while allied groups highlight features like a Center for American Progress study that found \u201cat least 104 MAGA Republicans have used guns and other deadly weapons in campaign ads.\u201d On Wednesday, House Democrats will roll out a series of recommended talking points to members that include focusing on a message that \u201cextreme MAGA Republicans care about only one thing: their own power,\u201d according to a presentation viewed by CNN. Republicans, the presentation argues, will criminalize abortion and roll back marriage rights, end Social Security and Medicare, and \u201ccontinue to attack our democracy, undermine free elections and make it harder for Americans to vote.\u201d Days of action have also been coordinated with the White House for events back in House Democrats\u2019 districts during the August recess, and include emphasizing proposed Republican cuts to Social Security on August 15, the anniversary of the social safety net, and Republican restrictions on abortion and other reproductive rights on August 26 on Women\u2019s Equality Day. House Democrats are also being encouraged to discuss the threat of gun violence on Sept. 7 in conjunction with the start of the new school year. \u201cRepublicans like to duck. They don\u2019t like to answer these questions,\u201d said Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, who helped craft the platform. She said she\u2019s been surprised both by how much abortion has resonated back home, and by how little most people have registered other issues like democracy and gun control. \u201cYou assume people know this. They absolutely don\u2019t know it.\u201d Michigan Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, who\u2019s facing a competitive re-election in what\u2019s become one of the swingiest states, said it\u2019s even simpler when making the case against the opponent he expects to emerge from an August primary, a self-funder who\u2019s never held elected office before. \u201cThe one thing we know about him is that he would vote for the Republican speaker. That would be Kevin McCarthy,\u201d Kildee said, referring to Republican candidate Paul Junge and the Republican House leader. \u201cMy record is my argument. The most we know about him is that he decided to run under the banner of a party that seems to have lost its soul. That\u2019s the contrast.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to win every heart and every mind,\u201d Kildee added. \u201cThere are a big number of Republicans right now that don\u2019t recognize their party. We can offer them a rational alternative, get a shot at some of those votes. And in a marginal tossup district like mine, that can be the difference.\u201d Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat who won one of the narrowest re-election bids in the country in 2020, said she\u2019s campaigning by talking about her record on trying to lower fuel costs and tackling meat packing consolidation. But Spanberger also said she is taking aim at what she says are her Republican opponent\u2019s \u201cextremist views.\u201d This November, Spanberger will face off against Yesli Vega, a local elected official who on the campaign trail questioned whether rape can lead to pregnancy and downplayed the January 6 riot as \u201ca group of Americans exercising their First Amendment rights.\u201d Spanberger said those positions \u201care out of touch with voters in the district, but also reality.\u201d \u201cIn our race, I certainly want people to vote for me,\u201d Spanberger said, \u201cbut I think the contrast and the options couldn\u2019t be clearer.\u201d New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a member of House Democratic leadership who spearheads messaging for his colleagues, has been urging colleagues to use a single, disqualifying word to tag Republicans with. He prefers \u201cextreme\u201d rather than \u201cMAGA Republicans,\u201d the phrase Biden landed on after other Democratic strategists determined that to be a more effective way to brand the party than what might come across as standard political name calling. \u201cRepublicans are extreme on gun safety and want our communities flooded with weapons of war. Republicans are extreme in trying to deny women the freedom to make their own reproductive health care decisions. Republicans are extreme with respect to the January 6th insurrection, and it appears that many of them no longer believe in democracy. Republicans are extreme on Social Security and Medicare, which they want to end in five years, and Republicans are extreme in their inability to actually support legislation that would lower costs for everyday Americans,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cRepublicans are out of touch with the American people and undeserving of the opportunity to govern.\u201d There\u2019s the talk, and then there are the numbers. CNN polling this month found that currently most voters see both parties as mainstream, with the exception of abortion, on which most call Republicans too extreme. They also tend to see Democrats as more mainstream on voting rights and election integrity, immigration \u2013 but view Republicans as more mainstream on the economy, which remains the overriding issue. \u201cEverything is on our side,\u201d Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign chair Florida Sen. Rick Scott insisted on Monday at an event in Washington, appealing to donors to keep up with Democratic fundraising. \u201cJoe Biden is not going to get better.\u201d In an interview with CNN, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said as much as Democrats need to appeal to independents and Republicans uncomfortable with their party\u2019s Trumpist turn, they also have to shock dispirited and disenchanted Democratic voters into turning out. \u201cThese candidates are trying to out MAGA each other and often the MAGA candidate is winning \u2013 and even when they don\u2019t, what we have seen is Republicans who eventually fall in line and do whatever Trump wants them to do,\u201d Cooper, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association,said about getting voters to the polls. \u201cThat should be a scary prospect for people as we approach these midterms.\u201d That sense was part of what drove Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker to spend millions of dollars in the Republican primary boosting a hardline candidate \u2013because he thought that would make for an easier re-election race, but also because he believes that the only difference between the candidates was that his preferred candidate is more transparent about views that all the others share. That\u2019s been a controversial approach within his own party, and one which Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who serves on the January 6 committee, told CNN this week that he found \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Yet Darren Bailey, who won the Republican nomination with Pritzker\u2019s help, is a Trump-endorsed state senator who hailed the overturning of Roe v. Wade as \u201chistoric and welcomed\u201d and supports an abortion ban without any exceptions. His other positions include legislation to remove the \u201chellhole\u201d of Chicago from Illinois to form the 51st state and saying people needed to \u201cmove on\u201d after the Highland Park shooting on July 4th. \u201cIf you are either espousing those extremist views, where you would force a 10-year-old to carry to term a fetus that was the product of a rape \u2013 whether it\u2019s that or the silent Republicans who say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to say anything out loud, even if I disagree,\u2019\u201d Pritzker said, \u201cthis is what\u2019s happened to the Republican Party. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, we are speaking the truth.\u201d Bailey\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t return a request for comment. Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss said the first-time candidates around the country whom he\u2019s been informally advising have been responding enthusiastically when he\u2019s pressed them not to let their opponents campaign as nice people or distanced from the Republicans who voted to overturn the results of the 2020 election or would support a national abortion ban. \u201cWhat we have to refuse to allow Republicans to get away with is to try to divorce themselves from the consequences of the votes that they\u2019re going to take,\u201d Auchincloss said. \u201cYour votes are very damaging not just to our democracy, but to the interests and well-being of the American people. And that is what you are going to be evaluated on.\u201d Even some of Biden\u2019s own White House aides wish he was being more forceful in calling out Republicans. The President has done some of it, sporadically. Announcing limited executive actions in response to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Biden said, \u201cthe choice we face as a nation is between the mainstream and the extreme.\u201d On Monday, in a speech to a Black law enforcement organization, Biden said that Florida Sens. Scott and Marco Rubio, along with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are not on the side of police because they oppose an assault weapons ban, and that Trump \u201clacked the courage to act\u201d to stop the January 6 riot. \u201cYou can\u2019t be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy. You can\u2019t be pro-insurrection and pro-America,\u201d said Biden, who\u2019s repeatedly pointed out that legislation moving through Congress to lower prescription drug prices isn\u2019t getting a single Republican vote. \u201cIf we only focus on affordability, opportunity, rebuilding the American dream, we miss a real chance with the extremity of the values that this Supreme Court has allowed to happen and many governors and states are seizing upon,\u201d said New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who won a tighter-than-expected race for a second term last year. Murphy said a perfect example is Doug Mastriano, the Christian nationalist Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania whose background includes leading buses of people to Washington on January 6, a commitment to a no-exception abortion ban, and associating with a website known for its violent and antisemitic connections. \u201cIf this lunatic in Pennsylvania were to be elected governor in my neighboring state, what are the consequences?\u201d Murphy said. Mastriano\u2019s Democratic opponent, Josh Shapiro, has regularly blasted the Republican as extremist on abortion and other policies, and last week tweeted a meme of him as \u201cLittle Mr. Conspiracy Theorist.\u201d Mastriano, who generally engages only with media he determines is friendly to him, did not return a request for comment. Biden \u201chas to\u201d start laying out the terms more clearly himself, Murphy added. \u201cThe President can feel confident in staking out a position \u2013 I know I feel confident \u2013 because we\u2019re not speculating. These are facts,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe know exactly what these folks are doing and what they say they will do. You read Clarence Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion [on the Dobbs decision]. You listen to Kevin McCarthy. You look at a [Ohio Rep.] Jim Jordan.\u201d Biden was planning to start sounding out a more forceful argument at a rally in Florida that had been scheduled for Monday, before his positive COVID test last week got in the way. A Biden adviser told CNN that when the President does come out of quarantine, he\u2019ll be talking about the work his administration has been doing for the middle class, but \u201cyou\u2019re also going to hear him continue to talk about congressional Republicans who are talking about taking extreme measures like banning abortion in every state across the country, want to raise your taxes, and are putting your Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block.\u201d Few are holding their breath, either for Biden to go hard, or for him to do it consistently, with the President often going days or weeks without returning to an attack. \u201cJoe Biden is Joe Biden. And I don\u2019t expect him to suddenly become a partisan flamethrower, and I don\u2019t think we need him for that,\u201d Schatz said. Anyway, he added, \u201cthe people who are most effectively making the case that Republicans have gone over the edge and are now extremists are: elected Republicans.\u201d In an interview with CNN, Rep. Tom Emmer, the Minnesota Republican and chair of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, dismissed the extremism talk as Democrats \u201ctrying to rationalize their way to the minority.\u201d All that matters is inflation and the bills Democrats passed last year which didn\u2019t stop it, Emmer said. \u201cYou could talk about anything but the issue and the results are going to be the same at the ballot box,\u201d he argued. \u201cWhen somebody says we\u2019re going to talk about these other things because they\u2019re much bigger, they\u2019re not talking to Main Street.\u201d Emmer ducked when asked if he\u2019d consider a federal ban on abortion to be an extreme position, saying, \u201cthe only thing that\u2019s extreme is the Democrats\u2019 no exceptions on abortion.\u201d When asked about candidates who were part of or supported the crowd at the Capitol on January 6, he said he wanted anyone who committed criminal acts to be prosecuted. He argued that it\u2019s not his party which has spun out of control. \u201cThere are no moderates left in my grandfather\u2019s Democratic Party. There are only San Francisco liberals, socialists and others.\u201d But the more moderate, less Trump-allied leaders in the party who hoped that the former President and his influence would fade, have expressed some discomfort with the trajectory of their party. In an interview on the sidelines of the bipartisan National Governors Association meeting in Portland, Maine, earlier this month, Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan \u2013 a prominent Trump critic who has said he won\u2019t be voting for the insurrectionist candidate who won the Republican primary to succeed him \u2013 said he thinks voters see both parties as moving away from them. \u201cRepublicans are talking about the Democrats as extremists and the Democrats are talking about Republicans as extremists. And in some cases, they\u2019re right,\u201d Hogan said. Hogan said he believes that most Americans remain driven by the economy and inflation, but he\u2019s not sure where that will lead voters. Asked what he thought of many of his fellow Republican leaders favoring abortion bans without exceptions, as in the case of those who wanted the 10-year-old Ohio girl to carry her pregnancy to term, Hogan said, \u201cWell, I would say that\u2019s an extreme position.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday delivered a speech outlining an \u201cagenda for the future\u201d in Washington \u2013 just hours before a competing speech from Donald Trump during the former President\u2019s first visit to the nation\u2019s capital since January 2021. Speaking to the Young America\u2019s Foundation, a conservative youth group, Pence delivered a modified version of an address he planned to give Monday at the Heritage Foundation before the event was postponed. \u201cI came today with the intention of speaking to you about a broad range of topics, but the weather had different plans for me yesterday, so today I\u2019m going to take the opportunity to speak about an agenda for the future,\u201d Pence said. The Indiana Republican said that conservatives \u201cmust focus on the future to win back America\u201d and laid out what he called a \u201cfreedom agenda\u201d of conservative policy goals on everything from the economy to immigration to cultural fights over education. The speech hinted at a platform for a presidential campaign, which Pence may pursue in 2024. \u201cI believe this freedom agenda provides a clear roadmap for conservative leaders like all of you to connect deeply with the American people on their top priorities,\u201d Pence said. Those aspirations put him in direct conflict with Trump, who is also considering running for president again. The two Republicans have been split since the events around January 6, 2021, when Trump put public and private pressure on Pence to delay the counting of electoral votes. Pence made an oblique reference to Trump, who has continued to argue falsely that the 2020 election was stolen, in his remarks. \u201cNow some people may choose to focus on the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut elections are about the future. And I believe conservatives must focus on the future to win back America.\u201d But the divide between the erstwhile running mates was on the mind of the crowd of young conservatives. When asked about the divide by an audience member Monday, the former vice president downplayed the idea there was any break within the broader conservative movement, saying he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration.\u201d But Pence did acknowledge a difference in \u201cfocus,\u201d however, between himself and Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know that the President and I differ on issues, but we may differ on focus,\u201d Pence said. \u201cI truly do believe that elections are about the future. And it is absolutely essential, at a time when so many Americans are hurting, so many families are struggling, that we don\u2019t give way to the temptation to look back. But I think the time has come for us to offer a bold and positive agenda to bring America back, and I\u2019ll continue to carry that message all across this nation.\u201d Trump will speak later on Tuesday at the America First Policy Institute\u2019s conference in Washington. The former president is expected to focus on \u201claw and order,\u201d according to Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich. \u201cPresident Trump sees a nation in decline that is driven, in part, by rising crime and communities becoming less safe under Democrat policies,\u201d Budowich told CNN. \u201cHis remarks will highlight the policy failures of Democrats, while laying out an America First vision for public safety that will surely be a defining issue during the midterms and beyond.\u201d Trump allies have told CNN they hope former President will use Tuesday\u2019s speech to look forward and focus on setting a Republican agenda ahead of the midterms, not unlike Pence\u2019s own effort Tuesday to provide an guiding agenda for Republican candidates in 2022. That agenda, he said, includes \u201cadvancing pro-life protections in every state in the union\u201d and enacting \u201cright-to-carry laws and constitutional carry\u201d for firearms in states across the country. Pence also offered criticisms of President Joe Biden and Democrats during his speech, contrasting the current administration\u2019s policies with his own proposed policy agenda. Much of his fire was directed at Biden\u2019s approach to the economy, going after the potential that the US is in a recession. \u201cWe need to permanently extend the Trump-Pence tax cuts for the American people. We need to eliminate special interest tax breaks and lower tax rates for working Americans and businesses. We need to support reciprocal trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first and with gasoline prices soaring,\u201d Pence said. But Pence also focused on a critique of the Biden foreign policy. \u201cToday, American leadership is hampered by this administration\u2019s flagging commitment to our national defense, flatlining investments in our national defense and the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan,\u201d Pence said. He called the withdrawal \u201ca disgrace\u201d that \u201cdishonored the service and sacrifice of every American who served in that nation to defend our country over the past 20 years.\u201d He also emphasized the need for conservatives to side with Ukraine over Russia and Vladimir Putin, citing his own experience as vice president with the Russian leader. \u201cLet me say this, as Russia continues its unconscionable war of aggression in Ukraine,\u201d Pence said. \u201cConservatives must make it clear that Putin must stop or Putin will pay. Our freedom agenda calls for continually marshaling support for freedom fighters in Ukraine. We need to continue to put economic pressure and we need to continue to isolate Russia until peace is restored for the good people of Ukraine. And I\u2019ve stood toe to toe with Vladimir Putin. I\u2019ve looked him in the eye and told him things he didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s speech is the latest example of Pence contrasting himself with Trump as the midterms and the 2024 presidential election loom. In Washington last Wednesday, Pence received a warm welcome from members of the Republican Study Committee, the conservative House caucus he once chaired, suggesting he still has cachet among elected members of his party, even within a House GOP conference that remains steadfastly loyal to Trump. And on Friday, Pence campaigned in Arizona for GOP gubernatorial candidate Karrin Taylor Robson. That put him in conflict with Trump, who was also in Arizona that day to stump for a rival candidate, Kari Lake. CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Arizona Republican Blake Masters, who earned Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement for the Senate race by embracing the former President\u2019s lies that he won the 2020 election, has turned to questioning whether the 2022 midterm election will be legitimate, as he tries to lock up support among the party faithful ahead of next month\u2019s primary. That the first-time candidate is escalating doubts about the election system in Arizona \u2013 home to a months-long partisan review of 2020 ballots \u2013 is a sign of just how resonant some Republicans continue to believe those lies are with their base, even if similar pitches from Trump-backed candidates failed in Georgia, for example, earlier this year. But the election denialism that has become a powerful force in Arizona GOP primaries since Joe Biden narrowly won the state in 2020 has also raised questions about whether a GOP nominee who says Trump won in 2020 can carry a purple state that\u2019s crucial to Republicans\u2019 hopes of winning Senate control. Trump\u2019s early June endorsement was a turning point in Masters\u2019 campaign against businessman Jim Lamon, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and retired Arizona National Guard Maj. Gen. Michael McGuire for the right to take on well-funded Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in November. But Lamon, who\u2019s largely self-funding his campaign, also has ties to election denialism \u2013 touting his efforts to help fund the controversial, partisan audit of the vote in Maricopa County, which failed to prove fraud in the 2020 election. Hitting Masters on immigration and his ties to billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, Lamon is widely seen as the biggest threat to Masters for the nomination. Masters, trying to mobilize primary voters ahead of August 2, escalated his efforts to sow doubt about US elections late last month, posing questions about whether the cheating he claimed happened in 2020 will happen in 2022. \u201cWhatever their cheating capacity is, I\u2019m pretty sure they pulled out all the stops,\u201d Masters said of the last election, speaking to a room full of potential supporters at June 30 campaign event in Cave Creek, Arizona, according to a video posted on the sharing platform Rumble. \u201cAnd the question is, will that happen again?\u201d \u201cI remember when President Trump called to endorse me he said, \u2018Blake, you\u2019re great, you\u2019re going to be a star, you\u2019re going to win, you\u2019re going to beat Mark Kelly \u2013 if you can get a fair election,\u2019\u201d Masters said. He went on to say that his father urged him not to run, asserting that even if he won by 30,000 votes, \u201cthey\u2019ll find 40,000 for Mark Kelly,\u201d to which he said he replied, \u201cI think there\u2019s always cheating, probably, in every election. The question is what\u2019s the cheating capacity.\u201d C. Murphy Hebert, spokeswoman for Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat running for governor, said, \u201cArizona voters can expect secure and accurate elections.\u201d Hebert added, \u201cStatements like this are completely unfounded and are clearly meant to create chaos and doubt to undermine faith in the election processes.\u201d Masters\u2019 campaign declined requests for comment. Trump\u2019s belief that the 2020 election was stolen from him has loomed especially large in the Grand Canyon state, and it\u2019s driving a rift between Trump\u2019s strongest supporters and the rest of the party. Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, for example, will hold dueling events on Friday for two different Arizona gubernatorial candidates, former local TV news anchor Kari Lake, who echoes the former President\u2019s lies about the election being stolen from him, and Karrin Taylor Robson, who does not. Masters will be at the Trump rally. Paul Bentz, a veteran Phoenix-based pollster who is unaffiliated with any of the Senate campaigns, said that Masters \u2013 who is supported by Thiel, his mentor and former boss, as well as the conservative Club for Growth \u2013 is leading the primary because of Trump\u2019s backing. \u201cHe\u2019s seen an immediate bump,\u201d Bentz said. Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to flip the Senate in November, and they\u2019ve made Kelly a top target. But Bentz said the election denialism that both Masters and Lamon have embraced in the primary could hurt them in the general election. \u201cA vast majority of the unaffiliated and independent voters do not believe that there is significant fraud that impacted the outcome of the election,\u201d Bentz said. \u201cMasters, and others who go down this election fraud route, will struggle to obtain support from those audiences in the general election.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a winning general election strategy,\u201d he added. Masters \u2013 who has also floated the conspiracy theory that the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol actually may have been a false-flag operation set up by the FBI \u2013 is part of a growing chorus of Trump-endorsed Senate Republican candidates who are raising fears about the security of the 2022 election. Last week, Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson told CNN that rules regarding absentee ballots needed to be stricter after they were \u201crelaxed\u201d in 2020 due to the pandemic, bemoaned Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s massive donations to a nonprofit benefiting local election officials, and said he\u2019d like to see changes to how Milwaukee counted its votes in order to restore confidence in the US election system. Asked whether he would be confident in the results of his own election this fall, Johnson said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what kind of controls we have in place.\u201d And last year, Nevada GOP candidate Adam Laxalt, who won the nomination in June, preemptively floated launching legal challenges in a talk radio interview. But election conspiracy theories have particularly proliferated in Arizona, where Biden beat Trump by only 10,457 votes out of more than 3.3 million cast. Trump\u2019s 2020 vengeances helped shape the Arizona Senate race early on when he repeatedly attacked Brnovich, widely regarded as the primary race\u2019s early frontrunner because he holds statewide office, for certifying his loss against Biden. Brandon Urness, Brnovich\u2019s campaign manager, said that Brnovich \u201cis one of the leading Attorneys General in the country on issues of election integrity,\u201d in response to Trump\u2019s endorsement of Masters. Lamon, a major donor to a voter registration group affiliated with election fraud conspiracy theorists, was also part of a small group that signed a document falsely claiming authority to cast Arizona\u2019s electoral votes for Trump in December 2020. After launching his Senate campaign, Masters initially sidestepped the former President\u2019s bogus claims about the past election. A year ago, Masters told CNN that \u201cit\u2019s really hard to know\u201d whether Trump won. In November, Masters went further, saying in a campaign video, \u201cI think Trump won in 2020.\u201d In his statement endorsing Masters, Trump wrote, \u201cBlake knows that the \u2018Crime of the Century\u2019 took place, he will expose it and also, never let it happen again.\u201d Barrett Marson, an Arizona Republican political consultant who previously worked for Masters, said there is a \u201csignificant group of voters\u201d who \u201cdefinitely believe 2020 was stolen from Donald Trump\u201d \u2013 and for them, \u201ctalking about 2020 resonates.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Maryland Republicans chose state lawmaker Dan Cox, an election denier who has taken a series of hard-line conservative positions, as their nominee for what will be one of the most difficult governor\u2019s offices for the party to hold in November\u2019s midterms, CNN projected. Elections officials on Tuesday night had begun what could be a weeks-long process of counting ballots. County officials were barred from beginning to process the record-breaking number of mail-in ballots for a primary election until after in-person voting concluded. Cox won the GOP race to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Larry Hogan \u2013 an outcome that showcased Republican voters\u2019 willingness to scrap what had been a winning formula in the deep-blue state after Hogan angered his own party with his criticism of Trump and his public safety measures amid the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s not yet clear which Democrat Cox will face; author Wes Moore and former Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez were the leading vote-getters as ballots were being counted Tuesday night. The primary was a proxy fight between former President Donald Trump, who endorsed Cox, and Hogan, who endorsed his former commerce secretary, Kelly Schulz. That Hogan had won two terms in Maryland was a feat: Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state, two-to-one; the state hasn\u2019t backed a GOP presidential candidate since 1988. But Hogan is seen as one of the GOP\u2019s most moderate figures. Here's why Maryland's primary results may not be known for days Cox has stoked fears about election fraud. He said in December 2020 on Facebook that Trump should seize voting machines. He chartered three buses to Trump\u2019s January 6, 2021, rally in Washington. And he tweeted amid the insurrection, \u201cPence is a traitor.\u201d He has also threatened a lawsuit over mail-in ballots. Democrats believe Cox poses a much easier general election match-up than Schultz would have. The Democratic Governors Association spent more than $1 million on television advertisements that highlighted Trump\u2019s endorsement and Cox\u2019s most conservative positions \u2013 a tactic intended to boost Republican support for Cox but diminish his standing among moderates headed into November\u2019s general election. Those spots highlighted his opposition to gun restrictions and abortion rights and his endorsement from Trump. One calls Cox \u201ctoo close to Trump, too conservative for Maryland.\u201d Schultz, in a news conference with Hogan last month, said that Democrats are attempting to \u201cspend a million now and save $5 million by not having to face me in the general election.\u201d The marquee contest on Maryland\u2019s primary ballots Tuesday was the governor\u2019s race. Hogan, who is among his party\u2019s most moderate figures and one who has frequently criticized Trump, is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. His departure has turned the primaries in the governor\u2019s race \u2013 one unfolding in a state where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by about two-to-one, but where the GOP has held the governor\u2019s office for 12 of the last 20 years \u2013 into a window into the larger battles unfolding in both parties on the national stage. Democrats saw a wide-open showdown featuring 10 candidates \u2013 a field that included Perez, Oprah Winfrey-backed Moore, state comptroller Peter Franchot, former US Education Secretary John King and Doug Gansler, the former Maryland attorney general and failed 2014 gubernatorial candidate. The primaries in the governor\u2019s race are the most closely watched contests on Tuesday\u2019s slate in Maryland, where the election was pushed back three weeks due to litigation over the state\u2019s legislative maps. Election results could take days or even weeks to finalize. According to Maryland\u2019s Board of Elections, more than 508,000 people requested mail-in ballots \u2013 shattering previous records for primaries. Counties cannot begin counting those ballots until Thursday, and elections officials say some counties could still be counting mail-in ballots in the first week of August. Several candidates for governor would make history in a state that has only ever elected White men as its chief executive. Perez, the former DNC chairman, emphasized his national experience as well as his local roots. He is a former Montgomery County councilman and was Maryland\u2019s labor secretary prior to joining former President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department as assistant attorney general for civil rights and later, Obama\u2019s US labor secretary. A Perez ad used Obama\u2019s previous comments about Perez, with the former President calling Perez \u201ctireless\u201d and \u201cwicked smart.\u201d Moore, meanwhile, aired an ad voiced by Winfrey, in which the television star calls Moore a friend and walks through his resume. Winfrey calls Moore \u201cthe type of transformational leader that these times demand.\u201d On a hot Election Day in Maryland, voters filed into their polling places. Portia Thompson, who said she has been voting since 1974, voted for Perez at the Colmar Manor Community Center and Town Hall. \u201cI think he would represent everyone. African Americans, Latinos, everyone. He also worked in President Obama\u2019s administration, so I thought he had the experience,\u201d Thompson said of Perez. The outcome of another major race was also clear Tuesday night: Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen easily fended off a Democratic primary challenge on Tuesday, according to a CNN projection. Van Hollen, who suffered a minor stroke in May, defeated a primary challenge from Michelle Smith, a Freedom of Information Act policy analyst with the US Agency for International Development. Ten Republicans are vying to take on the winner of that primary, but Van Hollen is heavily favored to win a second term. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the Maryland Democrat who is the chamber\u2019s No. 2-ranking member, also won his primary, CNN projected. CNN projected that Rep. Anthony Brown will win the Democratic primary in the Maryland attorney general\u2019s race. Brown, the lieutenant governor under former Democratic Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley who is leaving his US House seat after three terms, defeated O\u2019Malley\u2019s wife, Katie Curran O\u2019Malley, a former Baltimore City district court judge. The primary in the attorney general\u2019s race is effectively the general election in a state that hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the post in more than 100 years. (One Republican, Edward Rollins, was appointed to the post in 1952.) Brown, a Harvard-educated former military lawyer, would become the first Black person to serve as Maryland attorney general. He was backed by VoteVets, which supports Democratic candidates with military experience. The group aired TV ads criticizing O\u2019Malley over her charge that Brown \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the right experience for this job.\u201d One of Maryland\u2019s eight congressional seats is open this fall: The heavily Democratic 4th District seat, currently held by Brown, features former Rep. Donna Edwards facing former Prince George\u2019s County state\u2019s attorney Glenn Ivey in the Democratic primary. Edwards has high-profile supporters, including Hillary Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Ivey is being bolstered by ads attacking Edwards from the super PAC affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Thompson said she decided to vote for Glenn Ivey in the 4th District race because she believes he\u2019s a \u201cgreat gentleman.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t really have a negative opinion of Donna Edwards, but I like Glenn Ivey and his family. I like his wife. She comes around and will sit on your porch and talk to you,\u201d she said. Marcela Orellano, 38, was at the East County Community Recreation Center in Silver Spring at 9:30 a.m. because she\u2019s \u201cterrified about the presidential election.\u201d Although she said there is not a specific candidate that she\u2019s very excited for in the Maryland primary, she wants to see change and is concerned about gun laws, women\u2019s rights and immigration policies. \u201cI want to make sure I make a difference at least on the state level. I\u2019m looking for Democrats to fight for the things that are important to me,\u201d Orellano said. Sharda Ramdat, a 46-year-old mother, said gun violence and abortion rights are her top priorities. \u201cI am worried for my kids every single day, and I feel like there\u2019s no place you can have a moment of your own space. That\u2019s a big deal. I really want change, especially with gun laws,\u201d she said. Ramdat said she was excited for Moore and believes he\u2019s the best fit because he \u201chad a hard life growing up\u201d and would \u201cunderstand where the middle class and poor people are coming from.\u201d Robin Jones, 68, said affordable housing is one of her top priorities and that she is most focused on local issues affecting her community. \u201cI went to work at the phone company at 17, and I could afford an apartment making $125 a week. Now an apartment is the same amount as a mortgage, and there\u2019s just nowhere for folks to live,\u201d Jones said.",

            "article_content": "Neither Republican nor Democratic candidates for Congress are seen by most voters as having the right priorities, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The survey finds voters closely divided in their preference for this year\u2019s midterm elections and on the potential consequences of a Republican victory. Two-thirds of registered voters (67%) say that Democratic candidates for Congress in the area where they live aren\u2019t paying enough attention to the country\u2019s most important problems, with just 31% saying that these candidates have the right priorities. A similar 65% say that Republican candidates in their area aren\u2019t paying enough attention to important national problems, with 33% saying that GOP congressional candidates have the right priorities. Economic issues are currently voters\u2019 central concern. Nearly 7 in 10 voters (69%) currently call the economy extremely important to their congressional vote, and 67% say the same of inflation. Smaller majorities place the same level of importance on voting rights and election integrity (61%), and gun policy (60%). About half rate education (51%), abortion (50%) or crime (49%) as extremely important, and fewer say the same of immigration (42%), climate change (34%) or the coronavirus pandemic (26%). That focus on the economy has increased since earlier this year, even as the survey\u2019s field period spanned a series of events including the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe vs. Wade, the passage of a new gun law and several hearings of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Asked which of those issues they most want to hear candidates address, roughly half of voters choose either the economy (32%) or inflation (19%), with 14% saying guns, and fewer than 1 in 10 picking any of the remaining issues. Republican and Republican-leaning voters are particularly focused on economic issues: 71% say they most want to hear about the economy or inflation, with 10% naming immigration. Democratic-aligned voters have a more diverse array of top concerns, with 32% most wanting to hear about the economy or inflation, 23% about gun policy, 15% about voting rights and election integrity, 11% about climate change and 10% about abortion. Across a spectrum of major policy issues, majorities say that each party\u2019s positions are generally mainstream \u2013 the only exception is abortion, where most call Republicans too extreme. Voters are more likely to see Democrats as in the mainstream on voting rights and election integrity, immigration and abortion than to say the same of the Republicans. But they\u2019re more apt to see Republicans as mainstream on the economy than Democrats. Voters are evenly split on which party\u2019s candidate they\u2019d currently prefer in their congressional district, with 46% picking the Democrats and 46% the Republicans. That\u2019s a modest recovery for Democrats from CNN\u2019s May polling fielded in the days immediately following the leak of the draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe, but generally on a par with generic ballot numbers from earlier in the year. In July 2014, ahead of a good midterm year for Republicans, Democrats had a 4-point edge on this metric; in June 2018, Democrats led by a more substantial 8 points. Republican voters continue to hold a modest enthusiasm advantage, with 35% calling themselves extremely enthusiastic about voting, compared with 28% of Democratic voters. There\u2019s less difference in voters\u2019 reported levels of motivation: both 51% of GOP voters and 48% of Democratic voters say they are extremely motivated. Beyond their congressional preference in their own district, voters are closely split on whether the country would be better off (41%) or worse off (38%) if the GOP takes Congress, with 20% saying it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Most voters who anticipate that a GOP takeover would benefit the country cite economic issues (54%) when asked what they think would improve under Republican control, including 33% who mention economy overall and 18% inflation. The only other issue mentioned by more than 10% is immigration or border security. \u201cThey at least understand the economy and attempt to get the government out of the way, mostly,\u201d said one voter surveyed. \u201cThey are by no means perfect but always do better than [Democrats] on economic issues.\u201d Those who dread the prospects of a Republican victory, by contrast, are most likely to cite gun policy (26%), democracy and voting rights (21%), abortion (13%), women\u2019s rights (12%) and other civil liberties. \u201cFrankly, an erosion of voting rights and our democracy along with women\u2019s rights and protections for the LGBTQ+ community,\u201d said another voter who answered the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying.\u201d Neither President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump looks likely to lift congressional candidates\u2019 standing in the general election. Only 32% of voters say they\u2019d prefer a congressional candidate who supports Joe Biden, while 43% prefer one who opposes him, and 25% say it makes no difference. Trump fares slightly worse than Biden: 28% prefer a candidate who supports him, 49% a candidate who opposes him, and 23% have no preference. Both sets of numbers are largely unchanged from January. The overwhelming majority (88%) of voters who approve of Biden plan to vote Democratic in this year\u2019s midterms; among voters who disapprove, 70% plan to vote Republican and 19% to vote Democratic. The 2022 midterms are shaping up amid an atmosphere of broad political discontent. Just 18% of Americans approve of the way Congress is handling its job, down from an already-grim 27% last October \u2013 a shift due in large part to falling ratings among Democrats. The public also gives negative net favorability ratings to the Democratic Party (-13 net favorability), GOP (-13 net favorability), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (-26) and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (-26). McCarthy remains broadly unknown, 24% have never heard of him and another 28% have no opinion \u2013 only 4% and 14% respectively say the same of Pelosi. The Democratic Party is viewed by a majority of the public as generally within the mainstream in its positions on guns (57%), immigration (58%), abortion (58%), racial injustice (60%), the economy (60%) and voting rights and election integrity (64%). The Republican Party is seen by a majority as out of step on one issue: abortion, on which 55% say its policies are too extreme. Most say the GOP holds mainstream positions on voting rights and election integrity (53%), immigration (53%), guns (54)%, racial injustice (60%) and the economy (67%). Partisans\u2019 feelings toward their own parties are generally warm, with 78% of Democrats and 82% of Republicans viewing their own parties favorably. And few view their own parties\u2019 policies as too extreme. The highest share of in-party dissatisfaction comes with the GOP\u2019s views on abortion policy, which 24% of Republicans call too extreme. The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS June 13 through July 13 among a random national sample of 1,459 adults initially reached by mail, and is the third survey CNN has conducted using this methodology. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. Results among the 1,203 registered voters in the survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Two people have been charged with running a years-long scheme that took in at least $27 million from foreign investors, which involved false promises for green cards in exchange for investments, funding a fake school and promising access to prominent American politicians, including former President Donald Trump, in exchange for money that was allegedly used in a straw donor scheme. Sherry Li and Lianbo \u201cMike\u201d Wang were arrested Monday and charged with wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the US by obstructing the Federal Election Commission\u2019s administration of campaign finance laws in a complaint that was unsealed Monday. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Li and Wang for comment. Prosecutors allege that Li, from her Long Island home starting in 2013, devised a scheme to defraud investors by convincing them to invest in a fake plan to build a private school. Wang allegedly served as the general manager of the fictitious Thompson Education Center, the complaint states, and Li and Wang allegedly siphoned off proceeds for their personal use including housing, vacations, clothes, jewelry and political contributions to prominent politicians. Prosecutors have alleged Li and Wang acted as straw donors for foreign nationals to illegally give campaign contributions to support US politicians and political committees, including Trump, and that the pair used photos they took with Trump and former first lady Melania Trump to solicit investors to contribute to their project. CNN has reached out to representatives for Trump and the Republican National Committee for comment. \u201cAs alleged, the defendants enticed their victims to invest in a fraudulent scheme aided by misleadingly claiming that their fictitious project had the support of prominent politicians,\u201d United States Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. \u201cThe defendants were able to perpetrate this fraud by then selling access to U.S. politicians by unlawfully contributing foreign money to political campaigns in their own names and bringing foreign nationals as their guests to fundraising events,\u201d Peace added. Prosecutors allege that Li and Wang, who are both US citizens, brought foreign nationals to fundraisers for American politicians in return for payments from the foreign nationals that were used by Li and Wang to make political contributions under their own names, despite receiving multiple warnings that foreign nationals are prohibited from making political contributions. Prosecutors say Li and Wang attended a June 28, 2017, political event that raised money for a joint fundraising committee at the Trump International Hotel in DC, where they posed for photos with Donald and Melania Trump  as well as the 12 Chinese and Singaporean nationals whom Li and Wang arranged to attend the event. The complaint does not name the joint fundraising committee, but CNN previously reported that funds raised at the event would help finance two joint fundraising committees with the Republican National Committee: the Trump Victory fund and the Make American Great Again Committee. Seven of the foreign nationals who attended the event stayed at the same Washington, DC, hotel as Wang and Li, and their bill was more than $31,000, which prosecutors allege was paid for by funds from the Thompson Education Center project raised from foreign investors hoping to seek residency in the US. Prosecutors allege that bank accounts controlled by Li and the Thompson Education Center entities received large foreign wire transfers that Li and Wang used to fund large political contributions that were required to attend the fundraiser. According to the complaint, FEC records show that the joint fundraising committee received a $270,500 contribution in Li\u2019s name and that \u201cfinancial records reflect that this check was funded by multiple wires totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars received from Hong Kong-based banks accounts.\u201d A review of FEC donor data from June 2017 shows a contribution for $270,500 to Trump Victory PAC, among other contributions. The complaint also states that the joint fundraising committee received a check for $329,500 shortly before the event from Wang that \u201cwas funded by the same wires from the Hong Kong-based bank accounts\u201d that funded Li\u2019s check. FEC donor data shows a $329,500 contribution from Wang to Trump Victory PAC made in June 2017, among others. Prosecutors also allege Wang made a 2016 contribution to an unnamed congressional candidate. CNN confirmed FEC records show a $1,350 contribution made in Wang\u2019s name to a New York congressional campaign in January 2016. Prosecutors allege that both Li and Wang received separate donation solicitations from the congressional candidate that indicated contributions \u201care limited to US citizens and greencard holders\u201d among other requirements. It is unclear if prosecutors allege the donation to the congressional candidate was funded with money from foreign nationals. As part of the scheme, Li and Wang allegedly solicited donations from foreign nationals falsely promising they would get lawful permanent resident status as part of an investor program, prosecutors said. The EB-5 visa program allows foreign investors who make at least $500,000 in investments within specific parameters, which include stimulating the economy in high-unemployment or rural areas and creating jobs for US workers, to petition US Citizenship and Immigration Services for a conditional lawful permanent resident status, the complaint states. But projects that seek EB-5 investors are prohibited from guaranteeing that investors will be granted lawful permanent resident status. The complaint alleges the pair raised at least $27 million from more than 150 investors as part of the scheme, and $16.5 million was raised from EB-5 investors \u201cwho were promised a green card in return for their investment.\u201d Prosecutors allege that to date, no EB-5 investor has received a temporary or permanent green card, and instead, USCIS denied multiple requests for temporary green cards because it didn\u2019t find the Thompson Education Center\u2019s business plan credible. Li and Wang allegedly planned to construct a cultural theme park in 2011, which they touted would be a \u201cChinese Disneyland\u201d in upstate New York. Li allegedly told investors the project would create 3,000 jobs. The pair are also accused of offering for sale shares of stock in business entities created by Li meant to raise funds for the education center, and they allegedly made false claims about the progress of listing shares for one of their companies on the New York Stock Exchange. Prosecutors asked in a letter to the court that Li and Wang be released on bail only if they present a bail package with \u201csubstantial and meaningful assets,\u201d surrender passports, fully disclose financial assets and holdings and adhere to strict limitations on their movements, calling them both \u201csignificant flight risks.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The cost of consumer goods has jumped to its highest point in four decades. But in some of the most important battleground races in the country, the situation is even more dire for Democrats, who saw their constituents hit with price increases that were higher than the national average. In Phoenix, Arizona \u2013 a state where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is facing one of the toughest reelection races this fall \u2013 the cost of goods rose a whopping 12.3% from June 2021 to June 2022, according to the Labor Department. That\u2019s over three points higher than the national average, which hit 9.1%. Meanwhile, in the Atlanta metro area \u2013 which is represented by vulnerable Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock \u2013 costs climbed 11.5% over the same 12-month period. The latest inflation numbers, particularly in key swing states that could determine control of the Senate, brought into focus the deepening political problems for President Joe Biden and his party, and explain why vulnerable Democrats have publicly rung the alarm about the issue. Democrats desperate to retain control of Congress are now pleading with the administration and their party leadership to help them more forcefully combat rising prices \u2013 and, in the process, hang on to their seats. Kelly told CNN that the Biden administration needs \u201cto be looking for more opportunities to do things to lower costs.\u201d \u201cNine percent is a pretty big number,\u201d Kelly added. \u201cFamilies are finding it hard to afford a lot of things and have some challenging decisions to make.\u201d Kelly noted that he already called on Biden to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The administration announced on March 31 that it would release one million barrels of crude oil a day for six months. \u201cProbably don\u2019t want to end that,\u201d Kelly told CNN. \u201cThe price of gasoline has come down, but it\u2019s still incredibly expensive, historically, and it\u2019s unaffordable for a lot of families.\u201d And Warnock told CNN that Congress needs to suspend the federal gas tax and cap insulin prices. The first idea has been dismissed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi since it\u2019s not clear that consumers would reap the rewards, but the second could soon see action on the Senate floor. Warnock also called to invest in US semiconductor and microchip manufacturing. Warnock said some people now have to choose between buying groceries and buying prescription drugs. \u201cWe can do something about that \u2013 and we ought to do it,\u201d Warnock added. Inflation has become the top political issue for Americans, worrying nervous Democrats who know that there is no quick fix in Washington to create greater supply and less demand for products. Vulnerable Democrats say inflation has dominated conversations both back at home and in Washington, where the party is internally wrestling over potential solutions with a little more than 110 days until the November election. \u201cThis is a grocery and gas election,\u201d Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told CNN. \u201c(The Biden administration) had these goofballs talking about inflation was gonna be transitory, and then it was Putin\u2019s fault, and now it\u2019s Republicans\u2019 fault. They just need to look at themselves in the mirror. And you know what, in November, this is why they\u2019re going to lose.\u201d For months, Democrats have unleashed a number of reasons why costs have gone up. They\u2019ve blamed Russian President Vladmir Putin for invading Ukraine and sparking increases in food and energy prices, the pandemic for disrupting supply chains, and oil companies for allegedly taking advantage of consumers, despite protests from some prominent economists. On Wednesday, the Biden administration gave a new defense: the latest inflation record was \u201cout-of-date\u201d because gas prices have decreased over the past few weeks. But that response was not enough for Democrats on Capitol Hill, as Republicans continued to pummel them over the issue. Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senate Committee, said even if inflation was seven or eight percent, that would be \u201cridiculously high.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to win so many races over inflation,\u201d Scott told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible for the country. For elections, it\u2019s going to help us, but think about these poor families who are getting hurt.\u201d Some Democrats are starting to point the finger at one another. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, a vulnerable Democrat, criticized the Biden administration\u2019s handling of inflation, telling CNN: \u201cI have said for a while that I thought he and the administration have been too slow to react to it.\u201d The White House, which initially failed to recognize the pending inflationary crisis, dispatched officials to Capitol Hill last month in an attempt to arm Democrats with talking points on rising gas prices, inflation and other economic issues. But Democrats who attended the messaging meeting said they left feeling less than satisfied, with one lawmaker saying the meeting turned \u201cspicy\u201d when it got to the question-and-answer portion. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe that we can try and smooth things over with talking points, as if people don\u2019t know their own lives, their own bills and their own minds. \u2026 People aren\u2019t stupid. \u200b\u200bThere\u2019s no value in trying to hide the ball,\u201d Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, one of the most endangered House Democrats this fall, told CNN. \u201cWhat I need is a plan. I\u2019m not looking for messaging help.\u201d Slotkin has called for her party leadership to hold weekly votes on bills to lower the sky-high cost of consumer goods and gas prices. But some of the most realistic options \u2013 an economic package that would lower prescription drug prices and a China competition bill that includes funding for semiconductor manufacturers  \u2013 are both stuck in limbo. A Monmouth poll from earlier this summer asked Americans to name the biggest concern facing their family. The most common answer was inflation (33%), followed by a series of related economic issues, including gas prices (15%), the economy (9%), and everyday bills such as groceries (6%). Since the start of 2021, campaigns and groups have spent $92 million on ads referencing inflation \u2013 more than other top-tier issues like immigration or guns, according to AdImpact data. Republicans have blamed Democrats for the economic mess, and spent $54 million on the issue \u2013 more than double what Democrats have spent defending themselves on it. \u201cThis is hurting Wisconsin families \u2013 and I keep pointing out this didn\u2019t just happen,\u201d Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, a top target for Democrats this fall, told CNN. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just bad luck. This is caused by massive deficit spending. It\u2019s caused by their war on fossil fuel, which purposefully has driven up the cost of energy, gasoline, to record highs.\u201d Asked if he was worried that the increase in prices could hurt Democrats\u2019 ability to hold onto the 50-50 Senate, Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman, acknowledged inflation was a \u201cmajor\u201d issue, noted some bills Congress hopes to pass to decrease prescription drug prices, and pivoted toward the Republican effort to remove the right to abortion. \u201cWe understand that clearly rising prices is a problem for families and we\u2019re making efforts to help families deal with those rising costs,\u201d Peters said. \u201cAnd you just contrast that to the Republicans, who are completely silent on actually how to fix anything, and in fact are engaged in extremist politics and want to take rights away from women, and are not talking about issues that American people care about.\u201d Similarly, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who chairs the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, admitted inflation \u201cis a problem\u201d and has been encouraging his members to acknowledge Americans\u2019 suffering while also highlighting the party\u2019s plan to provide relief to consumers. \u201cWe are working the problem. The other side is trying to gain from it politically,\u201d Maloney, who himself faces a competitive reelection race, told reporters. \u201cWhat is the Republican plan for inflation, besides making people mad to win an election? They don\u2019t have the foggiest idea what they\u2019re going to do to fix the economy.\u201d Republicans disputed that they didn\u2019t have a plan to combat inflation. \u201cStop deficit spending,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLet\u2019s utilize what God-given natural resource we have to bring down the cost of energy. Let\u2019s at a minimum have work requirements for welfare payments.\u201d \u201cBalance the budget. Start cutting taxes. Reduce the regulatory environment. And become energy independent,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you have to do \u2013 and do everything you can to buy American products.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Ariel Edwards-Levy and David Wright contributed this report.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden has gone from narrowly winning Wisconsin nearly two years ago to becoming an apparent liability for Democrats running there \u2013 so much so that two of the leading candidates running for their party\u2019s US Senate nomination won\u2019t say whether he should run again. But the Wisconsin Senate Democratic candidates are banking on two key factors to overcome an unpopular President: spotlighting GOP Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s controversies and tapping into voters\u2019 anger that the US Supreme Court has sent Wisconsin back to an abortion ban enacted before the Civil War. \u201cI think it eliminates whatever advantage Republicans have,\u201d said Tom Nelson, an Outagamie County executive who\u2019s a Democrat running for Senate, about the ruling last week. The battle shaping up in Wisconsin is emblematic of the landscape confronting Democrats nationwide. The top candidates \u2013 Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, Wisconsin Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Nelson \u2013 are hoping that fury from their liberal base outweighs backlash Democrats may face over high consumer prices and Biden\u2019s low approval ratings. For Democrats, their best bet at codifying abortion rights nationally remains at keeping the Senate and picking up at least two seats in the fall, potentially here in Wisconsin and also Pennsylvania, while holding onto a handful of swing seats and keeping their endangered House majority \u2014 an extremely tall order. Then, they could potentially have enough support to change the filibuster rules next year and pass abortion rights on a straight majority, something backed by all the leading Wisconsin Democratic candidates. Here's what November's midterms look like after the spring primaries Wisconsin, a perennial battleground divided between its liberal enclaves mainly in the south and conservative rural regions throughout, has emerged as ground zero in the battle over abortion rights. With the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, the state is now following an 1849 law that bans abortions and provides no exceptions for rape or incest. There are exceptions granted to save a woman\u2019s life, but only after the signatures of three doctors \u2013 a standard that activists say can be onerous if not impossible to meet, especially in rural areas. Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, has vowed to give clemency to ensure that abortion access will remain unimpeded. But even that has abortion providers uncertain whether they can trust that will hold, given Evers faces a tough reelection himself and how the matter would be handled by a new administration is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cI have been frustrated that my own party has not prioritized this and trying to get this done, and we\u2019ve had 50 years,\u201d Godlewski said. In interviews with CNN this week, all of the top Wisconsin Senate Democratic candidates tried to project their progressive bona fides on abortion. Lasry, 34, noted his wife is a top official at Planned Parenthood Wisconsin. Barnes said his mother had to make \u201cthe difficult decision\u201d to get an abortion before he was born. \u201cAnd if she was forced to carry to term, that would have created all sorts of additional mental and physical health issues for her. I wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d Barnes said. The candidates all said they would eliminate the filibuster to pass a bill in Congress restoring abortion rights. None said they back restrictions, even late in pregnancy. \u201cThat\u2019s not up to a politician to decide,\u201d Barnes told CNN. Yet the candidates differ on expanding the Supreme Court to add justices. Barnes expresses an openness  \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation I\u2019m more than willing to have\u201d \u2013 while Lasry and Godlewski have yet to embrace it and Nelson boasts of being \u201cthe only candidate\u201d to back the idea. \u201cI think this is an appropriate solution,\u201d Nelson said. Johnson, a two-term senator, has said he supports the court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade and has tried to redirect attention elsewhere. In a local radio interview on Wednesday, he was asked for his view on the ruling and Wisconsin Democratic state officials\u2019 effort to prevent the enforcement of the state\u2019s 1849 law. Johnson at first called for more media coverage of a Texas human smuggling incident that left dozens dead \u2013 saying it \u201cis actually much larger news\u201d \u2013 before saying he approved of the new state-by-state approach on abortion. \u201cThis really needs to be decided by \u2018we the people\u2019 in each state through probably multiple elections, with state legislators and governors in the end passing laws in their individual states,\u201d Johnson said on WSAU. \u201cAnd then over time we will probably develop somewhat of a consensus nationally.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will affect this year\u2019s fight for control of Congress. Inflation remains Wisconsin voters\u2019 top issue of concern, according to a June Marquette University Law School poll, and Biden\u2019s approval has fallen to 40%, his lowest in the survey since taking office. But even as Democrats see abortion as a top-tier issue, they have to contend with the worst midterm environment since Johnson first won his Senate race a dozen years ago. Asked if he thinks Biden should run in 2024, Barnes deflected: \u201cWell, I\u2019m focused on this race right now. We still gotta get past November 2022. We still have to expand the majority in the US Senate. I\u2019m more than happy to have that conversation after we decide this race.\u201d \u201cThe President needs to do what\u2019s best for him,\u201d Godlewski said when asked if she thought Biden should mount a reelection bid. Lasry, who worked in the Obama White House before his billionaire father purchased the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014, said he\u2019d back a Biden reelection bid. \u201cI think if the President wants to run again, he should run again,\u201d Lasry said. When asked about Biden dragging down the ticket, Barnes added: \u201cThis is a hyper local race. We\u2019re focused on those bread-and-butter issues that are impacting people at home.\u201d The candidates have their own liabilities that their critics are spotlighting. Lasry, who, like the 40-year-old Godlewski, has vast personal wealth and is largely funding his campaign, has come under some criticism for relocating from New York to take the Bucks job in 2014. \u201cI don\u2019t think New York needs a third senator,\u201d said Nelson, who is 46. Lasry defended his move. \u201cWisconsin\u2019s my home, raising my family here,\u201d he said in an interview at a redevelopment site in Milwaukee. \u201cAnd what voters are more worried about are not where someone was, but what someone\u2019s going to do and representing them and what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Barnes, 35, has won the backing of some leading liberal voices, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and he\u2019s already come under attack from Republicans over immigration and his support for ending cash bail, as some Democratic critics fear he would turn off middle-of-the-road voters. Barnes, the state\u2019s first Black lieutenant governor and the second African American to hold statewide office in Wisconsin, scoffed at that notion. \u201cMy campaign is the only campaign in the Democratic primary leading with independent voters. This is the only campaign that has been generating any sort of enthusiasm,\u201d Barnes said. He added: \u201cOn an issue like cash bail, a person staying in jail before their trial shouldn\u2019t be based on their ability to pay.\u201d The Democratic candidates have tried to make the race about the incumbent and his series of controversial statements \u2013 whether it\u2019s advocating for hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 or spreading anti-vaccine misinformation during the pandemic. Johnson has raised questions about whether Trump supporters were the ones largely responsible for the violence on January 6, 2021, and he was involved in an effort to send then-Vice President Mike Pence a slate of fake electors on the day he was presiding over the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. The Democratic rhetoric has been sharp, with Barnes and Nelson calling on Johnson to resign and Lasry saying: \u201cIf you are trying to literally get false electors to the vice president to ensure that a fair election gets overturned, that\u2019s not what this country is about and that is treacherous and seditious.\u201d Johnson, 67, has downplayed or dismissed the criticism \u2013 and he defended the most recent controversy by saying it had been simply staff-level discussions that took place and it\u2019s a \u201cnothing burger\u201d of a story. But on Tuesday, Johnson was preaching \u201cunity\u201d at a church and praising a faith-based inner-city jobs program he co-founded years ago, acknowledging that political divisiveness in the country is taking a toll on him. \u201cAs I travel around and talk to people, I often ask the question, \u2018Aren\u2019t you just tired of all the anger and division?\u2019 \u201d Johnson asked. \u201cGod, I am. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d \u201cThis nation needs healing and unity,\u201d he added. After the event, Johnson bolted out the back door. Asked by CNN if he could take a question, he responded: \u201cNo.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It may be cold comfort as a stormy midterm election approaches, but House Democrats have achieved a modern milestone in this legislative session that crystallizes a fundamental transformation in how Congress operates. Working with a razor-thin majority, House Democrats have recorded the highest level of party unity in floor votes that either party has reached in at least 50 years, according to the authoritative statistics kept by Congressional Quarterly and Roll Call. House Democrats have passed legislation on virtually every element of their party\u2019s priority list \u2013 from the sweeping Build Back Better investment and social welfare package to bills setting a national floor for voting and abortion rights to major gun control proposals, legalization for big groups of undocumented immigrants and ambitious police reform \u2013 with dissenting votes from no more than two of their members and often opposition from only one or none. The immensity of that record has not received much attention because so many of the House bills have been blocked in the Senate by the Republican filibuster, opposition from Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, or both. But the consensus around this sweeping agenda stands in marked contrast to the Democratic experience under former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, when dozens of House Democrats routinely voted against the party on key measures, from Clinton\u2019s budget to Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. I think people feel that there\u2019s less tolerance for breaking with your party, that it could lead to a primary opponent and there\u2019s more [inclination] within each party to stick together. Former Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California \u201cThe ethos of the kind of norms and expectations within the caucus have shifted,\u201d says Democratic Rep. David Price of North Carolina, a former political science professor who is retiring this year after serving in Congress \u2013 with one two-year break \u2013 since 1986. \u201cI think there\u2019s some really different behavior now and a different level of party discipline and loyalty.\u201d The increased unity, many observers agree, is a testament not only to the skill of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in wrangling her caucus; it also reflects a succession of tectonic shifts in the electoral and legislative landscape that have transformed the historically unruly House into something much closer to a parliamentary institution that demands exacting levels of loyalty within each party \u2013 and produces far fewer possibilities of cooperation between them. These trends are virtually certain to survive if Republicans, whose own unity has been steadily growing over the past few decades, retake the House in November. No matter which party holds the majority, the House now seems locked into an irreversible path toward more polarization. \u201cI think people feel that there\u2019s less tolerance for breaking with your party, that it could lead to a primary opponent and there\u2019s more [inclination] within each party to stick together,\u201d says former Rep. Henry Waxman of California, who engaged in epic internal struggles with fellow Democrats to pass landmark legislation on the environment, health care and other issues from the 1970s through his retirement in 2014. Centrist and liberal House Democrats certainly have had their disagreements in this Congress. For months, they feuded over the size and composition of the party\u2019s grab-bag Build Back Better bill. Even more pointedly, centrists fumed as progressives for months delayed passage of a separate bipartisan infrastructure package for fear that Manchin and Sinema would block the broader BBB legislation if the two bills were decoupled \u2013 a concern that events have largely validated. But once the backroom negotiations have concluded and legislation reached the floor for final votes, House Democrats have achieved a level of unity unprecedented in modern times. In this Congress, Democrats have held, at most, a five-seat majority, leaving them achingly little margin for error. (Only twice since World War II has the governing party operated with a smaller majority.) Yet almost all of their major bills have passed with few or no dissenting votes. Just two House Democrats voted against the police reform legislation passed in March 2021 and the sweeping gun control package approved this month. Only a single House Democrat each time voted against a succession of high-profile bills the chamber approved in March 2021: HR 1, the party\u2019s sweeping election and voting bill; a bill establishing universal background checks for gun sales; a measure providing a pathway to legal status for undocumented farmworkers; and legislation long sought by organized labor to reduce legal barriers to union organizing. In September 2021, just one House Democrat voted against the bill to codify a nationwide right to abortion, and ultimately just a single Democrat voted against the Build Back Better bill when the House passed it two months later. Only a single House Democrat opposed the party\u2019s massive Covid-19 relief plan early in Biden\u2019s presidency. Earlier this month, only a single Democrat opposed the national red flag law the House passed, which would remove access to firearms for someone who is deemed a danger to themselves or others by a court. House Democrats voted unanimously in 2021 to remove the deadline for states to approve the Equal Rights Amendment; to establish a floor of nationwide LGBTQ rights; to provide a pathway to citizenship for young people brought to the US illegally by their parents; to restructure the Voting Rights Act to overwrite decisions weakening it by the Supreme Court\u2019s Republican-appointed majority; and for a sweeping executive branch package meant to combat some of former President Donald Trump\u2019s ethical abuses. The biggest exception to this pattern came when six liberal House Democrats voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill to protest its separation from the broader Build Back Better package. On most of these measures, the sole dissenting vote came from Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who represents a rural Maine district that voted for Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020; Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who is currently locked in a recount against a progressive primary challenger, was the sole dissenter on the bills to ease union organizing and to codify a right to abortion. In turn, either no House Republicans, or virtually none, voted for most of these bills, with only a handful of the measures (including the legislation providing a legal pathway for young immigrants and farmworkers and imposing universal background checks on gun sales) drawing support from even six or more GOP representatives. The consensus among House Democrats during President Joe Biden\u2019s term stands in striking contrast with the experience under the party\u2019s last two presidents. Defections were endemic during Clinton\u2019s presidency in the 1990s. In 1993, 41 House Democrats voted against final passage of his economic plan, 69 voted against the Brady Bill establishing the national background check system for gun purchases and 156 \u2013 a clear majority of the caucus \u2013 opposed his North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. The next year, 77 House Democrats opposed a ban on assault weapons and 64 voted against final passage of the massive, Clinton-backed crime bill that included it. So many House Democrats opposed Clinton\u2019s universal health care plan that it never reached the floor for a vote. Later, after Republicans led by Georgia\u2019s Newt Gingrich won control of the chamber and Clinton reached a deal with them to overhaul the welfare system, 97 House Democrats voted against it in 1996. The situation improved, but only marginally, under Obama. In 2009, 44 Democrats voted against the cap-and-trade climate-change bill that Waxman and Pelosi steered through the House; the next year, 34 voted against final passage of the Affordable Care Act. After those two votes, as I\u2019ve written, the hesitation of \u201cblue dog\u201d Democrats from mostly rural seats to take more politically risky votes helped convince Pelosi and the White House to abandon consideration of comprehensive immigration measures and shelved discussion of any new gun-control measures while the party held the House majority through 2010. This evolution is reflected in the comprehensive data on congressional voting compiled for decades by Congressional Quarterly, now in partnership with Roll Call. During the 1970s, their data show, House Democrats voted together only about 65% or so of the time. (Averages from Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s second term in the late 1950s, and the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson presidencies in the 1960s, show that House Democrats voted together at just slightly above that rate during those earlier years.) The Democratic Party unity rose to about 80% by the late 1980s, and advanced again to near 90% through Obama\u2019s first term \u2013 even with the prominent exceptions noted above. Since 2014, House Democratic unity has exceeded 90% in every year except one. The Democrats\u2019 unity score hit 95% for the first time during each of Trump\u2019s final two years and then reached a record level of 98% during Biden\u2019s first year, the most recent full year for which figures are available. Republican unity in the House has increased along a similar trajectory since the 1970s, although the highest level the GOP has reached is 93%, in 2016 and 2021. The growing unity that has peaked with House Democrats in this Congress reflects both internal changes in the chamber\u2019s operation and external shifts in the political landscape. The key internal changes are revisions in House rules stretching back decades that have centralized more power in leadership and heightened pressure on even the most senior House members to vote more often with their parties. The first pivotal moment in that process came in 1975, when House Democratic liberals pushed through a long-sought change requiring that committee chairs no longer be selected on the basis of seniority but through a vote of the party caucus; that eliminated the protection that conservative Southern Democrats had enjoyed for decades to wield great power while routinely voting against the party\u2019s agenda. Democrats actually used that power to bypass seniority in naming committee chairs very sparingly over their next two decades controlling the House. But when Republicans seized the majority in 1995 (for the first time in 40 years), Gingrich much more aggressively demanded loyalty to the party agenda as the price of advancement and implemented a number of other measures to centralize power in the leadership. When Democrats regained the House majority after 2006, they largely preserved the Republican changes \u2013 which had been taken to an even greater height by GOP Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas in the early 2000s after Gingrich left Congress. After Gingrich \u201ccame in and took discipline to levels you haven\u2019t seen since Joe Cannon,\u201d the legendary early 20th-century speaker, Price notes, it was clear that \u201cwhen we regained power, nobody wanted to go back to the days\u201d when powerful committee chairs operated as virtually independent fiefdoms. \u201cFor the most part [Pelosi] has managed to achieve a much greater level of discipline and unanimity and without some of the kind of abuses and some of the punitive measures toward members we saw,\u201d under Gingrich, argues Price, who has written several books about Congress. The consequences of voting against your leadership is failure, and failure for your party, just like a low approval rating for your party\u2019s president, means you are going to pay the penalty. I think that\u2019s what drives the unity. John Lawrence, former chief of staff to Rep. Nancy Pelosi Changes in the external electoral environment have contributed to this process perhaps even more powerfully. Of these, the most significant has been the geographic realignment since the 1990s, which has seen the virtual extinction of the rural and Southern center-right \u201cblue dog\u201d Democrats who most commonly voted against the party\u2019s agenda. Almost all of those seats are now held by conservative Republicans. The reverse process has severely reduced the number of moderate suburban House Republicans who most often voted with Democrats. \u201cIf you look at who those members were [who broke from the party] in the assault weapon vote under Clinton, they were from areas that no longer send Democrats to Congress, and the same is true in reverse for Republicans,\u201d says Price. In that sense, the near-unanimity among House Democrats can be seen as a sign of weakness as well as strength: The party now holds vanishingly few of the conservative-leaning districts where members would feel more pressure to break from the caucus. \u201cWhat you are seeing is the stripped-down version of the Democratic caucus,\u201d now centered overwhelmingly on urban and suburban districts, notes John Lawrence, a former chief of staff to Pelosi. A more fragile majority, in that regard, is the price of greater unity. This geographic realignment has combined with aggressive gerrymandering to create a second electoral dynamic encouraging unity. Through this century, the number of districts that lean reliably toward one or the other party has increased \u2013 which means that most House members worry more about primary opponents accusing them of voting too often against their parties than general election opponents attacking them for not displaying enough independence. Simultaneously, the electoral experience of the past two decades has shown that the old blue dog strategy of voting against your own party on big issues doesn\u2019t provide much protection for members in difficult districts anymore. If voters are dissatisfied with the majority party\u2019s performance, they have shown they will take it out even on members from the party who conspicuously vote against key priorities. \u201cThe nationalization of congressional elections makes conservative Democrats most vulnerable to unfavorable tides and renders appeals to local \u2018cultural\u2019 interests ineffective,\u201d notes Thomas Mann, a senior resident scholar at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. These internal and external forces reshaping the House converge in the acute awareness among members that control of the chamber is constantly within reach for either side. (If Republicans regain the majority this November, as most analysts expect, control will have shifted four times since 2006 after switching just twice from 1954 through 2004.) With control so tenuous, Lawrence points out, the minority party has no incentive to provide votes that will help the majority strengthen its political position by passing its agenda \u2013 and the majority party has enormous incentive to hang together to achieve a positive legislative record. \u201cThe consequences of voting against your leadership is failure, and failure for your party, just like a low approval rating for your party\u2019s president, means you are going to pay the penalty,\u201d says Lawrence, author of the upcoming book \u201cArc of Power,\u201d on his years in the House leadership team. \u201cI think that\u2019s what drives the unity.\u201d If Democrats can't pass their agenda now, they may not get another chance for years. Here's why Also pushing in that direction, he says, is that both parties are aware that it has become extremely difficult to legislate without unified control of the White House and both congressional chambers and neither side has been able to sustain those \u201ctrifectas\u201d for very long. (Since 1980, the only time either party has maintained unified control for more than two consecutive years has been the middle four years of the George W. Bush presidency, from 2002 to 2006.) \u201cThe difficulty of sustaining a majority really compels you to use the majority power when you have it,\u201d Lawrence says. The cumulative effect of these internal and external forces has been to forge a House (and for that matter, a Senate) that increasingly resembles the kind of parliamentary legislative institution in most other Western democracies \u2013 with one glaring exception. In parliamentary institutions, intense party discipline is expected in the governing party \u2013 as is indivisible opposition from the minority party. As the extraordinary House Democratic unity \u2013 and lockstep GOP opposition \u2013 in this Congress demonstrates, that\u2019s become the US model, too. But in parliamentary systems, the governing party can pass its agenda on a party-line majority vote. Here, because of the Senate filibuster, passing legislation requires a bipartisan supermajority (unless one party controls 60 Senate seats, which has happened only once since 1979). The result is that the US now operates with what many political scientists consider a contradiction in terms: a parliamentary system without majority rule. In a Congress now functioning so much like a parliament, says Price, \u201cI think the case for altering or abolishing the filibuster is much, much stronger than it has been.\u201d With Manchin and Sinema \u2013 and perhaps other Democrats \u2013 unmovable in their opposition to revising the filibuster, any changes in Senate rules won\u2019t come in time to salvage the ambitious agenda House Democrats have passed with near-unanimity since 2021. But as both parties unify behind their legislative priorities to a far greater extent than in the past, it seems increasingly implausible that they will indefinitely provide the other side, through the filibuster, a veto on whether they can move that agenda into law.",

            "article_content": "Homeland and national security officials are worried about how Russia could significantly exploit US divisions over the November midterms, considering scenarios like Russia staging smaller hacks of local election authorities \u2013 done with the deliberate purpose of being noticed \u2013 and then using that to seed more conspiracies about the integrity of American elections. These efforts, the officials said, would be designed to dovetail with the false doubts about the 2020 presidential election spread by former President Donald Trump and many of his allies. The five current and former US officials who spoke to CNN stressed that such a scenario remains hypothetical. Although US elections have become more secure in recent years, officials say that an atmosphere of distrust in America\u2019s elections, coupled with the sheer number of local election systems, means there\u2019s no way to truly be ready for such a convergence of Russian asymmetric warfare techniques. Administration officials agree with local election officials that the problem goes beyond inevitable security shortfalls. Current and former officials say little has been done to inform, let alone convince, American voters that Russia is trying to attack US elections again. Election officials worry about their safety ahead of midterms That\u2019s creating a battle for public perceptions of the security of elections, which often don\u2019t mirror the reality of how secure they are. \u201cIf something small happens, it will feed into the mania and chaos, and all of a sudden people will think all the elections are completely insecure,\u201d said Nicole Tisdale, who until April was the legislative affairs director at the National Security Council and previously served as the director for cybersecurity and counterintelligence with the House Homeland Security Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not about fixing a small problem so that it doesn\u2019t become a bigger problem. It\u2019s about what happens when folks feel there\u2019s been any leak in the boat, and folks thinking that the whole thing could sink,\u201d Tisdale said. An example of how officials believe the threat could play out: Russian hackers breach a local county voter registration system, making sure to get detected. They would then post information and proudly take responsibility rather than blame third-party hackers, as they did in 2016. Then, other Kremlin-backed forces would amplify the problems on Facebook and Twitter, aiming to churn up angry \u2013 and violent \u2013 reactions. \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t have to do anything in advance of the election \u2013 just observe where operational challenges occur and use that issue to exploit the subsequent distrust and division,\u201d said one US official involved in election security. \u201cThe asymmetrical advantage is astounding.\u201d It likely wouldn\u2019t take much to further undermine faith in American elections \u2013 as this month\u2019s public hearings of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol have shown. Tuesday's January 6 hearing will show evidence of Trump's role in fake electors scheme, Schiff says Adrienne Ray, the elections supervisor and registrar in highly competitive Peach County, Georgia, said she feels under siege, trying to keep her systems from being at the center of a story about international espionage. In the meantime, she relies on her IT guy, while taking online classes about election security offered by the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office. \u201cI\u2019m not a whiz at what these people could do,\u201d Ray said. \u201cBut we try our best to be as secure as possible. \u2026 Do I know if I\u2019m getting everything I need to know? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis warned that Russia will \u201clikely\u201d look to depress voting and \u201cprobably\u201d try to undermine the November midterms in revenge for the American-led response to the invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly declassified DHS report obtained by CNN. \u201cWe expect Russian interference in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections, as Russia views this activity as an equitable response to perceived actions by Washington and an opportunity to both undermine US global standing and influence US decision-making,\u201d states the report, titled \u201cKey Threats to the Homeland Through 2022.\u201d Russian attempts to interfere with and undermine American elections have been happening for almost a decade, but the evolution has US officials on edge. Most of the hacking that was tracked in 2016 was probing, looking for openings. Disinformation efforts were still rudimentary, elevating a few voices spouting racial divisions and disappointment in their candidates losing. But those efforts now more often use a wide array of avenues to play off divisions within the US about immigration, Covid-19 restrictions and 2020 election conspiracies. Meanwhile, intelligence officials say the disinformation methods have become broader and more sophisticated, as have the attempts to combine them. Explaining Russian interference and the ways in which those efforts look to play off current divisions, officials argue, would be essential to both understanding and withstanding the threat \u2013 but just doing so often runs up against the hyperpartisan reality. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes difficult to even discuss mitigation activities because of the political environment in Washington,\u201d said John Cohen, who until last month served as the acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cThere are foreign nations like Russia who are seeking to destabilize and weaken the United States, and they do that by pushing out information meant to exacerbate the social fractures of our society.\u201d Local election offices have stepped up their own security, but it\u2019s not clear that will be enough. In small-but-competitive Sauk County, Wisconsin, results received into the main clerk\u2019s office are then verified by phone calls to officials at each polling place, followed by a full canvas to make sure the numbers and records match up. Equipment is kept locked up and under video surveillance. None of the machines are connected to the internet, and two-factor authentication is required even to get into employee desktops. \u201cThis is way different from when I started, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Becky Evert, the Sauk County clerk, reflecting on how she\u2019s had to respond to the threat of Russian hacking. Evert said that she\u2019s confident that any breach would be caught but that she hadn\u2019t considered what it would mean if the intention was to get caught. Some funding for new security came from the state, but she said she hasn\u2019t been directly in touch with the federal government. In Philadelphia, the city has disconnected its election management system from the internet and met with state and federal authorities running \u201ctabletop\u201d exercises to iron out communications and plans for what to do if they detect a breach \u2013 including trying to wrap their heads around what to do if the breach is meant to be detected. \u201cI\u2019ve had to become sort of an expert in election security, cybersecurity, GIS (geographic information system) mapping, social mapping, physical security, I know more information about things that I never thought I\u2019d know anything about,\u201d said Lisa Deeley, a Philadelphia city commissioner, calling threats the \u201cscary and unpleasant\u201d part of her job. \u201cUnfortunately, this is the world of elections today.\u201d \u201cIf there was some kind of breach, the city and the state and the federal government would all align and give us the defense that we needed,\u201d Deeley said, while adding, \u201cWith elections, there\u2019s always a need for more funding and more resources.\u201d The DHS intelligence assessment of current threats obtained by CNN states that Russia remains a top threat \u201cparticularly in response to international pressure following its unprovoked attack on Ukraine.\u201d The DHS assessment also includes threats from China and Iran, though they are not primarily election-related. The China threats listed include cyber-espionage, predatory economic activity and influence campaigns to promote Beijing\u2019s interests. The Iran threats include cyber-threats to critical networks and \u201cstoking divisions within the United States and creating pressure on Washington to change its policy on Iran,\u201d as well as more conventional terrorist attacks via Hezbollah or other proxies. The threat assessment from Russia is different, however. Whether by dissuading Americans from voting, convincing them the votes are crooked or just making them lose faith in the candidates and institutions involved, \u201cMoscow\u2019s overarching objective is to undermine the US electoral process and weaken the United States through social and political discord, division, and distraction,\u201d the report states. As Russian President Vladimir Putin accelerated toward his invasion of Ukraine in February, officials from DHS and other agencies began meeting daily to discuss potential threats and responses. Election security was one of the topics from the start, though at that point \u2013 with November many months away \u2013 they focused mostly on more immediate possible vulnerabilities around power grids and banking systems. \u201cPeople believe that this is one of these ways in which Putin potentially gets back at us without triggering a kinetic response of some kind. There\u2019s a lot of concerns that if he were to try to punch back at us for supporting Ukraine, this is one of the ways he\u2019d do it,\u201d said an administration official familiar with the internal discussions. Those meetings have grown less frequent, but the concerns around elections have grown, as November has gotten closer and the Russian quagmire in Ukraine has continued. The alert has remained high within the White House and among the members of the interagency election security group created in the Biden administration, even as they\u2019ve struggled with what to do. White House officials are aware that any attempt by President Joe Biden to speak about disinformation or Russian hacking would immediately be seen as political, as would most efforts by the federal government to fell local authorities how to administer elections. \u201cThe federal government is still trying to figure out how to bring together all of the capabilities it has to engage in a comprehensive manner,\u201d Cohen said. A National Security Council spokesperson declined comment. Though national security officials did not initially believe that Putin was moving on Ukraine with the intention of creating problems geared toward the US midterms \u2013 either through driving up gas prices or sowing a general sense of chaos \u2013 as the crisis escalated, according to two officials, the intelligence became increasingly concerned that the American response would convince Putin that the 2022 elections were a legitimate and high-priority target. After an atmosphere of distrust during the 2016 election, federal, state and local officials have worked more closely to share threat intelligence and drill for cyber and physical threats, observers say. That work includes helping move state and local offices to the \u201c.gov\u201d internet domain, which makes it easier to identify official sources of information on elections, and federal vulnerability assessments for election-related computer systems. According to the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, an estimated 93% of votes cast in the 2020 election had a paper record \u2013 up from 82% in 2016 \u2013 serving as an important check against potential tampering. Reviewing some of the information that led to the DHS report, the department\u2019s intelligence officials have briefed state and local election authorities about threats in recent months. DHS last year hired former Washington state Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, as a top elections security official, and she\u2019s already been to 17 states promoting the department\u2019s services. Sometimes, though, the efforts amount to sending around best practices guides and hoping election officials pay attention. A Homeland Security spokesperson noted the regular collaboration with the intelligence community in tracking threats, and the department\u2019s role in sharing that with the full range of election administrations. Since Alejandro Mayorkas took over as DHS secretary at the beginning of the Biden administration, the spokesperson said, \u201cDHS has enhanced operational collaboration with partners across every level of government, including by sharing timely and actionable information and intelligence regarding the threat environment to protect communities across our country.\u201d Secretary of state offices in Michigan and Colorado both said they are continually working to protect their election systems, including working with federal partners, but a spokesperson for the Colorado office noted that it has only heard \u201cgeneric, not specific to elections, warnings about the potential for Russia to seek to disrupt their adversaries while they are engaged on the Ukraine front.\u201d The concerns remain high across government. Recently, 17 Democratic senators signed a letter, addressed to the secretaries of defense and homeland security, as well as the directors of the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency, asking what was being done to protect the \u201cripe target\u201d of the midterm elections. \u201cAs we witness an alarming increase in Russian disinformation campaigns following Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, we must remain vigilant in protecting our elections from potential malign influence operations,\u201d Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who spearheaded the letter, told CNN. Sean Lyngaas contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol Hill insurrection holds its first prime-time public hearing on Thursday and is expected to give an overview of their findings from the past year. The hearings are expected to shine a spotlight on the nine-member committee, which features seven Democrats and two Republicans. Here\u2019s who they are: Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi is the chairman of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack. Thompson also serves as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, the first ever Democrat to hold the position. As chairman of the Homeland Security panel, Thompson introduced and oversaw the House\u2019s passage of the legislative recommendations after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Thompson is a civil rights pioneer who started his political career by registering fellow African Americans to vote in the segregated South. His first political victory was being elected the first Black mayor of his hometown of Bolton, Mississippi. He is the only Democrat serving in Mississippi\u2019s delegation. Thompson views the work of the January 6 committee in the same vein as his work in the civil rights struggle. \u201cOur democracy is at stake,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe have to defend our democracy. We have to defend our government.\u201d GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming serves as the vice chairwoman on the committee. Cheney is one of two Republicans on the panel appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled all five of his selections because Pelosi would not accept two of his picks. Cheney has been an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump and was one of 10 House Republicans to vote to impeach him. House Republicans have punished her for her public opposition to Trump by removing her as their party\u2019s conference chairwoman in May of last year and she faces a Trump-endorsed challenger in the GOP primary in her reelection bid. That primary is in August. Cheney told CBS in an interview that aired over the weekend that she believes the January 6 attack was a conspiracy, saying when asked, \u201cI do. It is extremely broad. It\u2019s extremely well organized. It\u2019s really chilling.\u201d She has even gone as far to say that Trump\u2019s inaction to intervene as the attack unfolded was a \u201cdereliction of duty.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff is a Democrat from California. Schiff also serves as the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was the lead impeachment manager representing Democrats during Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial. \u201cJanuary 6 will be remembered as one of the darkest days in our nation\u2019s history. Yet, more than a year later, the threat to our democracy is as grave as ever. January 6 was not a day in isolation, but the violent culmination of multiple efforts to overturn the last presidential election and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in our history,\u201d Schiff said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe former President and his allies have spent every day since January 6 attempting to rewrite history about that bloody attack on our nation\u2019s Capitol. That\u2019s why these public hearings are so essential \u2013 to show the American people exactly how January 6 came about, who is responsible, and most critically, what we can and must do to prevent another attack on our democracy.\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin is a Democrat from Maryland who previously served as the lead impeachment manager for Democrats during Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial. In the days before the Capitol insurrection, Raskin announced the death by suicide of his 25-year-old son, Tommy, on New Years Eve 2020. Raskin reflected on the tragic loss of his son, and his experience living through the attack on the Capitol, in his book \u201cUnthinkable: Trauma, Truth and the Trials of American Democracy.\u201d Raskin said that becoming the lead House impeachment manager last year served as a \u201clifeline\u201d in the aftermath of his son\u2019s death, describing to David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast how Pelosi asked him to lead the second impeachment managers. \u201cAnd then she said, \u2018And I\u2019d like you to be the lead impeachment manager,\u2019 and I also agreed to that immediately, but I realized soon thereafter, she had thrown me a lifeline, because I wasn\u2019t sure if I could ever do anything again,\u201d Raskin to Axelrod. Rep. Elaine Luria is a Democrat from the Virginia Beach area who represents a community with a significant number of constituents connected to the military. Luria is a Navy Veteran. She served 20 years as an officer on Navy ships, retiring as a commander. She has attributed her military background as part of her motivation for serving on the January 6 committee and getting to the bottom of what happened on that day. Of the nine members of the committee, Luria is facing the toughest general election in the fall midterms. Her district, already considered to be competitive, became more Republican leaning after redistricting. While other members of the committee, like Rep. Stephanie Murphy and Rep. Adam Kinzinger decided against running for reelection, Luria has embraced the challenge. She announced her plans to run for a third term on January 6, 2022, at the exact minute she and her staff were forced to evacuate her office because of a pipe bomb threat. \u201cI hope that people learn just how fragile our democracy is and how close we were to losing it on January 6. If certain people were not in the right places on January 6, we would be looking at a very different scenario and possibly a different country,\u201d Luria said about the importance of the upcoming hearings. Rep. Pete Aguilar is a Democrat from Southern California. Before coming to Congress, he served as the mayor of Redlands, California. Aguilar is considered a rising star in the House Democratic Caucus. As vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus he is the highest-ranking Latino member in congressional leadership. In addition to his role on the January 6 committee, Aguilar has several high-profile committee assignments. He also a member of the committees on Appropriations and House Administration. Aguilar believes the committee\u2019s most important job is creating a full, comprehensive record of what led to the violence of January 6. \u201cWe are going to give the American public a full accounting of what happened the day of the violent attack on the US Capitol, an attack which sought to overturn the will of the voters and led to the deaths of five police officers,\u201d he said. \u201cThese hearings will lay out the facts in a way that\u2019s informative, accessible and compelling. I hope that this can be a moment for the country to come together and rally around our shared values. Those responsible for the violent attack must be held accountable.\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren is also a Democrat from California who served as an impeachment manager in the first impeachment trial against Trump. Lofgren is also chair of the Committee on House Administration. Lofgren was first elected to Congress in 1994. She also served as a staffer on Capitol Hill for eight years. Lofgren has a background as an immigration lawyer and has made reforming immigration law a key part of her portfolio as a member of Congress. She also represents a big part of the Silicon Valley and as a result has had a heavy focus on tech related issues. She is a long-time ally and friend to Pelosi. The duo has served in the California Congressional delegation together for close to three decades and both represent different parts of the bay area in Northern California. Rep. Stephanie Murphy is a Democrat from Florida. Murphy is the first Vietnamese American woman elected to Congress. Before serving in Congress, Murphy was a national security specialist in the office of the US Secretary of Defense. Murphy said the challenge for committee members is to translate the mountains of information learned through the investigation into a digestible narrative for the American people. \u201cThe Select Committee has obtained a vast amount of testimony and documents,\u201d Murphy said in a statement to CNN. \u201cOur goal \u2013 and our challenge \u2013 is to use the public hearings to distill this information down to its essence, to tell an accurate and easy-to-understand story about why January 6th happened, and to provide some concrete recommendations about how our country can prevent something like it from happening again. Our audience are Americans across the political spectrum who are committed to securing our democratic institutions and processes.\u201d Murphy announced in December 2021 that she would not be seeking reelection. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is one of two Republicans on the committee and broke with his party by accepting the appointment from Pelosi. Kinzinger, once thought to have a bright future in GOP politics, has taken heavy criticism from his colleagues because of his criticism of Trump. He has placed much of the blame of inciting the violence that day on Trump and his allies. Kinzinger is one of 10 Republicans who voted twice to impeach Trump after the Capitol insurrection. He also voted for the bipartisan independent commission to investigate the riot. His willingness to take on Trump led to the former President personally promising to back a primary opponent. Instead of facing the prospect of a Trump back challenge, he chose to retire from Congress at the end of his current term. Kinzinger served as a pilot in the United States Air Force. He flew missions into Iraq and Afghanistan and was stationed in Iraq on two different occasions. He is currently a Lt. Colonel in the Air National Guard. While Kinzinger\u2019s time in the House of Representatives may be coming to an end, he has teased a future political run and recently launched a national leadership PAC to raise money to support like-minded candidates and causes.",

            "article_content": "Blake Masters, the Republican Senate candidate from Arizona, met with conservative activists at a Phoenix IHOP this spring and was asked whether he would support investigating US intelligence operations to uncover the federal government\u2019s \u201cnefarious activities.\u201d Masters replied, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d and then floated the conspiracy theory that the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol actually may have been a false-flag operation set up by the FBI, according to a recording of the March 30 meeting obtained by CNN. \u201cDon\u2019t we suspect that like one-third of the people outside of the Capitol complex on January 6 were actual FBI agents hanging out,\u201d Masters asked at the GrassRoots Tea Party Activists of Arizona event. \u201cWhat did people know and when did they know it? We got to get to the bottom of this.\u201d Masters is part of a wave of Republicans who have won the coveted endorsement of former President Donald Trump after parroting his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and downplaying the actions of the pro-Trump mob that attacked the Capitol last year. While top Republicans like Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell have urged candidates to move on from 2020 and focus on the future, some, like Masters, are aligning themselves with Trump in the hopes of tapping into his base of support. After launching his Senate campaign last year, Masters has increasingly embraced the former President\u2019s bogus claims. He told CNN in July \u201cit\u2019s really hard to know\u201d whether Trump won, questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. But in November, Masters went further, saying in a campaign video, \u201cI think Trump won in 2020.\u201d Masters then went to Trump\u2019s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, for a fundraiser attended by the former president. In January, Masters joined Trump at a rally in Arizona, where the former President asked, \u201cExactly how many of those present at the Capitol complex on January 6 were FBI confidential informants, agents or otherwise working directly or indirectly with an agency of the United States government?\u201d In May, Masters returned to Mar-a-Lago to watch a screening of Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s election conspiracy documentary \u201c2000 Mules.\u201d At the Tea Party event, Masters articulated an anti-institution worldview. He claimed without evidence that \u201cBig Tech\u201d altered its algorithms to try to help Joe Biden win the White House and said that the United States has a \u201ctwo-tiered justice system\u201d where liberal rioters receive lighter sentences than non-violent, pro-Trump trespassers. And he advocated to fire \u201ceverybody you can\u201d at the politically \u201cweaponized\u201d Justice Department. The January 6 attack on the Capitol was not an FBI false-flag operation. It was a violent attempt by Trump supporters to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. Masters campaign officials declined to comment. But a source familiar with Masters\u2019 thinking said he was \u201csimply sharing his concerns\u201d with the FBI\u2019s actions, and wants the bureau to answer more questions about how it handled the attack. \u201cThese are all things Blake has said on the campaign trail for over a year,\u201d added the source. Masters\u2019 espoused belief that Trump won the last election has paid off. Last week, Trump endorsed Masters over the other Senate GOP candidates, including state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who certified his 2020 loss in Arizona, and solar-energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon. The winner of the August 2 primary will face Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. \u201cBlake knows that the \u2018Crime of the Century\u2019 took place, he will expose it and also, never let it happen again,\u201d said Trump in his statement backing Masters. Masters, 35, is a hard-right, immigration hawk who wants to take on the technology industry in which he spent his career. His mentor and former boss, billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, co-founded PayPal and software company Palantir, which received an early investment from a CIA-backed venture fund, and made major investments in Facebook and SpaceX. Last year, Thiel donated $10 million to a Super PAC, Saving Arizona, supporting Masters. On March 30, Masters said he hoped Thiel would spend more even though he couldn\u2019t legally ask him, calling Thiel one of the few \u201cAmerica First\u201d billionaires after the late mega donor Sheldon Adelson passed, and the Koch network \u201cnot even conservative anymore\u201d because of their immigration policies. (In May, Thiel invested another $3.5 million into the Super PAC.) While some of his GOP opponents have targeted his background to portray Masters as owned by \u201cBig Tech,\u201d Masters has pitched himself as uniquely able to take on technology corporations, and prevent them from suppressing conservative content, because of his experience. In his speech to Tea Party activists, Masters\u2019 message was essentially: tear it down. He pledged to vote to eliminate the Education Department, called 95% of regulations \u201cbad,\u201d and chided former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell for merely delivering a tax cut when Trump was president. He mentioned his work on the 2016 Trump transition team, praised Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who famously advocated for \u201cthe deconstruction of the administration state,\u201d and criticized former Republican National Committee chairman and chief of staff Reince Priebus as \u201ckind of a big RINO.\u201d Masters\u2019 anti-establishment vision extends to how the federal government enforces the law. The Arizona GOP Senate candidate claimed in his speech that the US has a \u201ctwo-tiered justice system\u201d that treats January 6 rioters unfairly and proposed widespread firing of DOJ employees who he thinks are politically motivated. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard but I think it starts by firing everybody you can,\u201d Masters said. The Senate candidate also went after Facebook, Twitter and Google, calling them monopolies, claiming that they tilted the 2020 election for Joe Biden and criticizing them for suspending Trump from their platforms after January 6. Masters also said Twitter interfered in Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s next election in January, when it suspended her personal account for repeatedly violating their policy by posting misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. \u201cWhen you keep Marjorie Taylor Greene off Twitter, that\u2019s election interference,\u201d Masters said.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris made a late May call to Honduras\u2019 President Xiomara Castro with a subtle nudge that would neatly encapsulate her fraught task of addressing the root causes of migration to the southern border. From her West Wing office, she received an update on the Central American leader\u2019s progress to combat corruption, a source familiar with planning told CNN. And in return, Harris relayed a succinct message: The United States would welcome Castro\u2019s participation at the high-profile Summit of the Americas that President Joe Biden will host this week in Los Angeles. But, as of Monday, Castro \u2013 whose inauguration Harris attended just months ago \u2013 has still not committed to coming. Nor have the leaders of the other two nations \u2013 Guatemala and El Salvador \u2013 in Harris\u2019 portfolio. And despite the efforts Harris and her team have made to cultivate relationships in the region during prominent trips and to secure $1.2 billion in private investments to bolster regional economies, major roadblocks remain as she addresses the drivers of migration in the Northern Triangle nations. A White House official maintained that they are \u201cseeing progress\u201d and that the vice president is planning to roll out a new cache of private sector commitments, along with a new women\u2019s empowerment program meant to be a continuation of the root cause strategy laid out last year. But, like previous administrations, finding a reliable partner in the region has proved difficult. In El Salvador, there\u2019s been concern about limiting checks and balances in government, while in Guatemala, there have been concerns about government corruption. And in Honduras, there was an even greater concern about corruption within the government before Castro\u2019s election. Now elected, Castro has struggled to make inroads rooting out corruption, restoring democracy and curtailing organized crime, which has rankled the country for decades. Those issues have all been identified by the Biden administration as having an outsized role in driving up migration. Experts on the region say that this summit provides Harris an opportunity, on US soil, to show the progress she\u2019s made. \u201cI really do look at this as an important moment,\u201d Sergio Gonzales, the executive director of the Immigration Hub and former senior policy adviser to then-Sen. Harris, told CNN in an interview. \u201cNot only substantively in terms of the policies that the administration is going to hopefully roll out at the summit and the cooperation they\u2019re going to look for with the other leaders who are attending. But I think also just in terms of communicating through the summit, \u2018Here\u2019s the progress we\u2019ve made, and here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to move this work forward,\u2019\u201d he added. Harris will participate in a week of events during the Summit of the Americas meant to highlight her efforts to address the root causes of migration in Central America. \u201cThe Vice President is focused on creating a prosperous and inclusive future for the people of the Western Hemisphere,\u201d a White House official said. Notably, Harris will deliver remarks to launch \u201cnew private sector and public sector initiatives to promote women\u2019s economic empowerment and address gender-based violence in the region\u201d and host a roundtable with business executives where she will \u201cannounce significant new investments in the region by the private sector.\u201d Since being tasked with this portfolio last year, Harris has leaned on the private sector to shore up support for Central America. In May, on her way to the United Arab Emirates, Harris called the leaders of the Partnership for Central Americas while on Air Force Two. The partnership acts as a liaison between companies and the US government. Under Harris, US initiatives have already provided \u201cmicro and small businesses access to $100 million in financing to support economic recovery in the region,\u201d according to a White House fact sheet released in April. The US\u2019 support for private sector investment has also helped to create \u201cmore than 70,000\u201d new jobs. And an anti-corruption task force was stood up to prioritize prosecutions against corrupt actors in the region. Experts credit her ability to secure private sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date. Harris\u2019 call to action for companies yielded commitments from major companies like Microsoft, Mastercard, Chobani, Duolingo, Nespresso, Bancolombia and Davivienda. Nespresso, for example, is working with more than 1,200 farmers in the region and is sourcing coffees from farms in Honduras and El Salvador for the first time in the company\u2019s history. Microsoft is planning to expand internet access to millions of people in the region by July. Along the way, the vice president has received regular updates and spoken with executives who have pledged to invest in the region, sources say. But the tangible effect of those investments is not yet widespread and the heavy focus on the private sector has raised concerns among those who want to place greater emphasis on other issues causing migration. \u201cIt seems that a plan that is centered on private sector investment cannot single handedly address the root causes, which range from internal displacement and poverty to \u2013 of course \u2013 violence, corruption, and natural disasters, plus the added factor, and I think increasingly, of climate change,\u201d Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told CNN, while commending Harris for taking on the task. Ana Mar\u00eda M\u00e9ndez-Dard\u00f3n, director for Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America, argued pandemic aid provided by the US \u2013 under Harris and Biden\u2019s leadership \u2013 has had a greater effect in Central America. The US government has delivered more than 15 million free vaccines bilaterally and in partnership with COVAX, a global entity which supplies bulk vaccines across the world, to countries in northern Central America. M\u00e9ndez-Dard\u00f3n said she would like to see an increase of short-term efforts focused on corruption, like sanctions on bad actors, to cut down on regional officials\u2019 ability to degrade the rule of law while more of the long-term economic investments to curtail migration take time. Aside from private sector commitments, Harris is planning to unveil a new initiative focused on getting women to take part in the economy, promote gender parity and target violence against women, those familiar with the plan say. Jason Marczak, senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, applauded those efforts, adding that looking forward, it will be essential to find opportunities that have longevity and find consensus in Congress so initiatives can \u201cgo beyond one administration.\u201d Migration remains at historic highs amid deteriorating conditions in Latin America that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. At the US southern border, US Customs and Border Protection stopped more than 310,000 migrants from the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador from October through April, according to agency data. But a new trend has also been taking shape that\u2019s posed a challenge to the administration: about 40% of border crossers are now from countries outside of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. More than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have fled the country, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Nicaraguans have also increasingly been migrating, as well as Haitians who had moved to the region years ago. The Summit of the Americas will serve as a platform for the Biden administration, leaders of countries in the region, and the public and private sector to come to agreements about the path forward in stemming the flow of irregular migration. Harris has not broadened her root causes portfolio beyond the Northern Triangle countries, a source familiar told CNN. Administration officials have been focused on expanding legal pathways for migrants moving in the hemisphere, not only to come to the United States, but also other countries in the region where there may be opportunities. \u201cOne area where there\u2019s a lot of common ground is, we have major job shortages in countries like the Unites States, Canada, Mexico and Spain. One of the primary drivers is people out of work, how do we link the two?\u201d a senior administration official told CNN. Officials are also preparing announcements on refugee resettlement and expanding family reunification to other countries, a pathway provided to people who have a relative in the United States. There are also expected to be discussions at the summit on stabilizing countries that are already hosting migrants but grappling with a host of challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic, the senior administration official said, citing Colombia, Ecuador and Chile.",

            "article_content": "With Democratic control of the US House and Senate on the line in this fall\u2019s midterm elections, the races for those chambers have drawn plenty of attention. Republicans appear to be in good position to make gains in November, buoyed, in part, by historic midterm headwinds facing the party in power, economic concerns and President Joe Biden\u2019s low approval ratings. But races at the state and local level will also have consequences that extend far beyond this year. New state laws targeting abortion, guns and voting rights, among other issues, have put a spotlight on the state and local officials responsible for signing or enforcing those measures. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Democratic candidates for governor, secretary of state and attorney general are presenting themselves as bulwarks against full GOP control of their states. Republicans, meanwhile, are eyeing opportunities to either maintain or win control of key state offices, though former President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement in several of those races, and the possibility of nominating candidates who have questioned the 2020 election results, has complicated the calculus. Looming over most of these races is 2024, with implications for who will control the election infrastructure in key swing states and who will emerge as viable presidential contenders. Meanwhile, local-level races will have consequences for the future direction of the Democratic Party, while contests for certain state Supreme Court seats will be pivotal to the fight over redistricting, which is expected to continue into this decade. Here are 20 state and local races to watch in 2022: The anticipated rematch of the fierce 2018 election between now-incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams is finally set after Kemp defeated a Trump-backed primary challenge from former US Sen. David Perdue and Abrams ran unopposed for her party\u2019s nomination. That result was a notable mark against Trump\u2019s influence, especially among Georgia Republicans who aren\u2019t ready to trade in their longtime leaders at the former President\u2019s behest. But it was also a show of force for Kemp, who remains very popular with his party \u2013 enthusiasm that he\u2019ll need in a race with Abrams. The bigger question now is whether Abrams, whose near-miss in 2018 made her a national Democratic star, can close the narrow gap with Kemp in a potentially high-turnout general election despite new Republican-enacted restrictions on voting. There are few Democratic politicians better equipped to strategize around those restrictions than Abrams, a longtime voting rights advocate, but the field will almost certainly be tilted against her given Biden\u2019s poor approval numbers. 2018 was a good election year for many Democrats amid a backlash to Trump. But this time around, Abrams is swimming against the national political tide. The race to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf will see Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro face off against Trump-backed state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a fervent promoter of the former President\u2019s 2020 election lies. A win for Mastriano would give someone who attempted to overturn voters\u2019 will in 2020 power over the election machinery in one of the nation\u2019s most important battlegrounds during the 2024 presidential race. In Pennsylvania, the governor appoints the secretary of state \u2013 the person in charge of running the commonwealth\u2019s elections and signing off on its electors. Shapiro, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary, has defended Pennsylvania\u2019s 2020 presidential election result and is emphasizing voting and abortion rights in his campaign. The leak of the draft US Supreme Court opinion that would overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide has roiled elections across the country, including in Pennsylvania. Democratic groups have launched a multimillion-dollar campaign attacking Mastriano for his opposition to abortion rights. Shapiro has argued that should Roe fall, the governor\u2019s role would be crucial in a state where the GOP-controlled legislature has already passed bills that would impose abortion restrictions, which were vetoed by Wolf. Democratic control of the Silver State is on the line in 2022. The party has dominated Nevada in recent years \u2013 albeit by narrow margins, a still remarkable turnaround for the once-red state. That could change this fall. Republicans across the country and in Nevada have made inroads with Latino voters, and the GOP hopes that lingering anger over pandemic restrictions and the national antipathy toward full Democratic control of Washington will help them break through in Nevada. Gov. Steve Sisolak, who ended a two-decade Democratic drought in the executive office with his 2018 victory, faces a difficult race likely no matter whom Republicans nominate. GOP hopefuls include Clark County Sheriff Joe Clark, who has Trump\u2019s endorsement, and former US Sen. Dean Heller. But with competitive races for US Senate and House and other statewide offices as well, the results out of Nevada will speak volumes about the political future of the western state. Arizona emerged as a critical battleground in 2020 when Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee to win the state in almost a quarter-century. The GOP race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey will be a test of Trump\u2019s influence on the party. The primary features, among others, TV reporter-turned-politician Kari Lake, who has the former President\u2019s endorsement; former US Rep. Matt Salmon, who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2002; and businesswoman Karrin Taylor Robin, a onetime member of the state Board of Regents. The front-runner for the Democratic nomination is Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who has come under fire over a racial discrimination case stemming from her time as Democratic leader in the state Senate. Former Nogales Mayor Marco Lopez is also seeking the Democratic nod. At stake: full control of Arizona government, where the GOP has held both the governor\u2019s office and the state legislature since 2009. With the US Supreme Court expected to throw the debate over abortion to the states, Wisconsin could be central to that fight. The state is not only hosting a marquee Senate race this year, but Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has vetoed several bills aimed at curtailing legal abortion, is running for reelection in a state where Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature. Evers has also used his veto pen to block GOP-led legislation aimed at changing state election laws and expanding gun rights. His positioning as the lone Democrat standing between full GOP control of the state will likely define his campaign. The national mood was behind Evers in 2018, when he unseated Republican Gov. Scott Walker. This year looks very different. The GOP field remains largely unsettled ahead of the August 9 primary. Trump has endorsed businessman and Army veteran Tim Michels. Other candidates include former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, Marine veteran Kevin Nicholson and state Rep. Timothy Ramthun, one of the state\u2019s leading promoters of false election conspiracy theories. This race also has national implication. Biden won Wisconsin by just over 20,000 votes, and the possibility of an equally close race in 2024 could loom over the gubernatorial contest. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis won election in 2018 by just under 33,000 votes out of 8.2 million ballots, but he certainly hasn\u2019t governed like he\u2019s running a purple battleground state. Rather, DeSantis has risen to the top echelon of potential 2024 GOP contenders by attacking Disney, creating a new election police force, pushing through a partisan congressional map, banning abortion after 15 weeks without exemptions for rape and incest, promising to lift gun restrictions and signing legislation to restrict how schools teach about racism and sexual orientation and gender identify. Republican donors have responded, contributing $117 million to his reelection fight and making him the first gubernatorial candidate in US history to break the nine-figure mark without self-funding. Heading into November, Republicans are looking to dispel any doubt that the state has turned a deeper shade of red. Democrats vying to take on DeSantis include US Rep. Charlie Crist, a onetime GOP governor, and state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried. But the incumbent is the favorite, and a blowout victory would further boost his resume as he weighs his political future. The high-profile race to lead the Lone Star State pits two-term Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, a potential 2024 presidential contender, against Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman who drew national attention with a near-miss 2018 Senate campaign and an unsuccessful 2020 bid for president. The issue of gun rights could play a role in the campaign following the tragic mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in the South Texas town of Uvalde that left 19 students and two teachers dead. O\u2019Rourke confronted Abbott and other Texas officials during a news conference in Uvalde in May after the massacre, saying the governor was \u201cdoing nothing\u201d to prevent more gun violence. Abbott, who has signed legislation loosening gun restrictions, argued that tougher gun laws aren\u2019t \u201ca real solution.\u201d The governor has leaned further into hot-button GOP priorities over the past year, signing into law new election and voting restrictions and a ban on abortions after six weeks. That positioning helped him beat out a crowded field of primary challengers in March. Abbott has also been a top critic of the Biden administration, especially on its push to roll back Title 42 \u2013 the pandemic-era public health order that has allowed immigration officials to turn back migrants at the border. While O\u2019Rourke gives Democrats their strongest candidate possible, he faces an uphill battle for the governorship in a state where his party has not won a statewide election since 1994 \u2013 its longest statewide drought in the country. Alaska is debuting a new voting sytem this year that was approved by state voters in 2020 in an attempt to make elections less partisan. Under the new system, all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot in the primary, with the top four advancing to the general election. Voters in the fall can rank their choices in order of preference. If no one receives a majority, the candidate in fourth place is eliminated and those votes go to whomever was ranked second on those ballots. The process continues until a candidate reaches a majority. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who has Trump\u2019s support, is facing a challenge from his predecessor, independent Bill Walker, who ended his bid for a second term in 2018 less than three weeks before the election \u2013 throwing his support to the Democratic nominee \u2013 over concerns that he could not win in a three-way race. Walker faced backlash while in office for reducing the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend that is given annually to each Alaska resident as he dealt with a budget deficit deepened by a collapse in the price of oil. And that could hamper his comeback attempt. Others in the race include Democratic former state Rep. Les Gara and Republicans Christopher Kurka, a state representative, and Charlie Pierce, the Kenai Peninsula Borough mayor. Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is looking to win another four-year term. Benson rose to national prominence amid the 2020 election fallout \u2013 as she defended the election process and results, in the face of efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the state. At one point, she said, armed protesters showed up outside her home to demand she reverse the outcome. This fall, she is expected to face Kristina Karamo, a political newcomer and community college professor who was endorsed at the Michigan GOP state convention in April. Karamo\u2019s nomination is expected to be reaffirmed at an official party vote in August. Karamo, who has Trump\u2019s endorsement, gained attention after the 2020 election when she alleged witnessing fraud as a poll challenger during the counting of absentee ballots. She also signed on to an unsuccessful US Supreme Court challenge to Biden\u2019s win. Two hundred and fifty post-election audits by Michigan\u2019s secretary of state confirmed the accuracy of the 2020 election in the state, which Biden won by more than 150,000 votes. In addition, a GOP-led state Senate investigation found no evidence of widespread fraud in the election. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is coming off a big primary win over fellow Republican Jody Hice, a four-term congressman endorsed by Trump. The incumbent famously rejected Trump\u2019s demand to \u201cfind\u201d the votes he needed to overturn his 2020 loss in Georgia. And while Raffensperger has defended that election as \u201chonest and fair,\u201d he also has embraced much of a controversial law enacted last year in the Peach State that imposes an array of new voting restrictions. Hice, meanwhile, was one of 147 GOP members of Congress who objected to certifying Biden\u2019s victory. Raffensperger will need to wait a while to learn who his fall opponent will be. State Rep. Bee Nguyen, who helped lead the charge against voting restrictions passed by the legislature, and former state Rep. Dee Dawkins-Haigler will meet in a June 21 runoff for the Democratic nomination after neither cleared 50% of the vote in the primary. Nguyen, who has scored endorsements from EMILY\u2019s List and the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, won about 44% of the vote in the May primary to Dawkins-Haigler\u2019s roughly 19%. Arizona, a state that Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes, has become a hotbed of fringe conspiracy theories about election fraud. The secretary of state holds special prominence in Arizona as the officeholder is the first in line to succeed the state\u2019s governor in the event of illness or death. The state does not have a lieutenant governor. Republican state Rep. Mark Finchem has promoted the falsehood that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump, earning an early endorsement from the former President in his bid for secretary of state. Other GOP contenders include advertising executive Beau Lane, state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita and state Rep. Shawnna Bolick. Democrats will be looking to hold the office Katie Hobbs won in 2018 after more than two decades of uninterrupted GOP control. Vying for the party nod are state House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding and Adrian Fontes, the former top election official in the state\u2019s most populous county of  Maricopa, home to Phoenix. Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold is seeking a second term as Colorado\u2019s top election official in a state Biden won by double digits in 2020. But the battle for the Republican nomination has seized the spotlight. Tina Peters, the clerk of Mesa County who was indicted by a county grand jury earlier this year as part of a local investigation into a security breach of voting systems, is running to face Griswold this fall. Peters has denied the charges, saying the investigation is partisan and politically motivated. A district judge, however, recently barred her from overseeing this year\u2019s elections in the county. Despite her legal woes, Peters received some 60% of the vote at a gathering of Colorado Republicans in April. Former Jefferson County Clerk Pam Anderson, who has pushed back on false claims of 2020 election fraud, is also in the race. Colorado Republicans officially pick their nominee in the June 28 primary. Griswold is unopposed for the Democratic nomination. While races for state attorney general often receive less attention, the contest in Michigan is emblematic of how significant they could be in 2022, especially if the US Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. Democratic incumbent Dana Nessel will face Trump-endorsed Matt DePerno, a Kalamazoo lawyer who has promoted the former President\u2019s false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 election. DePerno received the state GOP\u2019s endorsement during its April convention and is expected to be formally nominated by the party in August. Nessel, the state\u2019s first openly gay statewide elected official, has prioritized consumer protection and civil rights during her tenure. She has more recently honed in on abortion rights, detailing her past experience with an abortion and declaring she would neither defend nor enforce the state\u2019s 1931 abortion ban, should Roe v. Wade fall. DePerno has said that he does not support abortion rights under any circumstances and that an overturning of Roe \u201cwill be such a great win for the unborn and for states\u2019 rights.\u201d The race for Kansas attorney general may provide a clear test of whether, even in a deep-red state, the type of Republican nominee still matters. Democrats believe the contest could be competitive if Republicans nominate Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state and anti-immigration firebrand. Kobach, who has repeatedly made baseless claims about voter fraud and served on Trump\u2019s much-derided commission on election integrity, has a complicated relationship with Kansas voters. After winning races for secretary of state in 2010 and 2014, he lost back-to-back bids for governor, in 2018, and US Senate, in 2020. In multiple instances, GOP groups have spent money against Kobach, worried that his name on the ballot could make it easier for Democrats to win. Republicans blame Kobach for losing a winnable gubernatorial race in 2018 to Democrat Laura Kelly, who is up for reelection in November. Kobach, however, has long been closely associated with Trump, something that has already propelled other Republicans to victory in 2022 primaries. Also competing for the GOP nomination are state Sen. Kellie Warren and former federal prosecutor Tony Mattivi. Former police officer and prosecutor Chris Mann is running for the Democratic nod. Democrat Tom Miller, the longest-serving state attorney general in the country, has won reelection in tough years for his party, including the GOP waves of 1994 and 2010. In that latter election, he defeated Republican Brenna Bird \u2013 then Brenna Findley \u2013 by double digits. Bird, now the Guthrie County attorney, is back for a rematch, and Miller could be in for a different race this year. The once swing state of Iowa has trended red in recent elections \u2013 after voting twice for Barack Obama, the state twice backed Trump by comfortable margins. And while Miller has built a brand in Iowa since his first election in 1978, political headwinds facing Democrats this year complicate his bid for an 11th term. Bird, who is running unopposed for the GOP nomination, is campaigning in part on standing up to the Biden administration and against federal overreach. She also outraised Miller during the first four and half months of the year. There is very little power invested in the New York lieutenant governor\u2019s office. Until, as has become typical in the state, the governor resigns in a cloud of scandal and his deputy takes over the big office. Gov. Kathy Hochul is the latest to make the jump, ascending after her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, resigned in disgrace last summer. Hochul seems like a safe bet to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and a full term in November, and has no (known) legal issues. But her first choice as lieutenant governor did \u2013 Brian Benjamin resigned as her second-in-command in April after being arrested on campaign finance fraud charges. His departure opened up the field ahead of the Democratic primary. Hochul\u2019s pick to replace him, now-former Rep. Antonio Delgado, has a good reputation in New York political circles and will be a formidable candidate in the primary. (In New York, candidates for governor and lieutenant governor run in separate primaries but the winners then run on the same ticket in the general election.) Delgado\u2019s main primary challenger is Ana Mar\u00eda Archila, who would be the first Latina and LGBTQ candidate elected to statewide office and is running in tandem with gubernatorial hopeful Jumaane Williams, the New York City public advocate. Archila, a supporter of progressive politicians for years, has a strong following on the left. Also in the Democratic race is former New York City Council Member Diana Reyna, the running mate of moderate US Rep. Tom Suozzi. Former New York City police officer Alison Esposito is unopposed in the Republican primary. Democratic Rep. Karen Bass entered this year\u2019s Los Angeles mayoral race as the candidate to beat as she vies to become the first woman and the first Black woman to lead America\u2019s second-largest city. The former social worker and community organizer became known as a dealmaker during her years in the California State Assembly and was on Biden\u2019s short list for his running mate. But she is now locked in a tight race with shopping mall developer Rick Caruso, a Republican-turned-Democrat who had spent nearly $34 million on his campaign as of May 21 (most of which he loaned to his effort). With many voters angry about the city\u2019s continuing crises with homelessness and worried about the rise in crime, Caruso, a former city police commissioner, has argued that career politicians have failed to solve the city\u2019s problems and that now is the moment when Angelenos should elect an outsider. If no one wins a majority of the vote in the June 7 all-party primary, the top two vote-getters \u2013 favored to be Bass and Caruso \u2013 would advance to the fall general election. San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, a former public defender elected in 2019, faces a recall vote in June over criticism that his progressive prosecutor model has made the city less safe. The recall effort and subsequent campaign to remove Boudin has been spearheaded largely by outside groups led by Neighbors for a Better San Francisco, which also spent big in a recent school board recall election. Whether crime has, in fact, gotten worse in San Francisco during Boudin\u2019s time in office is less certain. The available statistics show a mixed bag, but no apparent overall surge, and little to distinguish San Francisco from other major cities around the country. But a number of high-profile, viral shoplifting incidents, rancor in Boudin\u2019s office and a broader, national pushback against his style of law enforcement \u2013 which prioritizes rehabilitation over the \u201ctough on crime\u201d approach \u2013 have put Boudin\u2019s fate in doubt. Home to Houston, Harris County is the third-largest county in the country, with a population of more than 4.7 million. Democrat Lina Hidalgo is running for a second term as county judge, a position akin to a county executive in other states. Hildalgo, who was born in Colombia and emigrated with her family to the US as a teenager, emerged as a Democratic star four years ago when she unseated a three-term Republican at the age of 27 to become the first woman and first Latina to lead Harris County. Army veteran Alexandra del Moral Mealer won the Republican nomination in a runoff to take on Hidalgo at a time when the incumbent\u2019s campaign is reeling from several controversies. Three current or former Hildago aides were indicted in a vaccine contract scandal. Meanwhile, the Harris County election administrator, who was appointed by a board Hildalgo serves on, is resigning following a vote count mishap in the March primary. Many Democrats view Hidalgo as a future candidate for statewide office, but, first, she will need to overcome what is expected to be a strong GOP effort to unseat her this fall. North Carolina is among several states that hold partisan elections for their highest court. And fall races for two state Supreme Court seats could shape North Carolina politics for years. Democrats currently hold a 4-3 edge on the bench, with two Democratic-held seats on the ballot this year. In the legal battle over redistricting, the court\u2019s Democratic majority blocked what it viewed as a Republican gerrymander of the state\u2019s congressional map. A map approved by a state trial court offers more electoral opportunities for Democrats, but it\u2019s only expected to be in place for this year\u2019s elections. If Republicans win control of the state Supreme Court and retain their majorities in the state legislature, the GOP will have the power to draw the 2024 map \u2013 Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, cannot veto redistricting bills under state law. Democratic Justice Sam Ervin IV is seeking a second eight-year term against Republican Trey Allen, general counsel for the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts. Two state appellate judges \u2013 Democrat Lucy Inman and Republican Richard Dietz \u2013 are facing off for the seat of retiring Democratic Justice Robin Hudson.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Arizona Senate hopeful Blake Masters in a move that aides believe will give the Republican significant momentum ahead of the state\u2019s August primary. Calling Masters \u201ca great modern-day thinker,\u201d Trump praised the tech entrepreneur Thursday in a statement that underscored the candidate\u2019s commitment to the former President\u2019s top priorities \u2013 from immigration and gun rights to relitigating the 2020 election. \u201cBlake knows that the \u201cCrime of the Century\u201d took place, he will expose it and also, never let it happen again,\u201d Trump said in a statement, referring to false claims of electoral fraud in 2020. Masters, who is also backed by conservative tech billionaire Peter Thiel, is running in a crowded field of GOP candidates seeking to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in November. Final report from partisan Arizona review confirms Biden defeated Trump in Maricopa County last November Trump took his time making the endorsement, surveying aides over the past several months \u2013 including some who are working for rival candidates Mark Brnovich, the state attorney general, and solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon. But advisers to the former President have previously told CNN the outcome of the Ohio Senate primary in early May was good news for Masters, who, like Ohio GOP Senate nominee J.D. Vance, is a prominent Thiel acolyte. Thiel had privately lobbied Trump to endorse Vance and Masters, in addition to pouring millions into super PACs supporting both men. Just weeks before Trump unveiled his endorsement of Masters, Thiel made another $3.5 million contribution to Saving Arizona, the Masters-aligned group \u2013 on top of an initial $10 million investment. \u201cPresident Trump is a great man and a visionary,\u201d Masters said in a statement released by his campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to have his endorsement. I wish everyone could know how this feels.\u201d \u201cSoon we will have a young, fearless, dynamic America First coalition in the U.S. Senate and that is thanks to Donald Trump,\u201d Masters said. Lamon said that he was \u201cespecially disappointed\u201d in Trump\u2019s endorsement of Masters and that his rival \u201cwould be shred to pieces\u201d by Kelly in a general election. A statement Thursday from Brnovich campaign manager Brandon Urness did not mention the latest development but noted that Brnovich \u201cintends to fight and win this Primary Election and we look forward to working with President Trump to defeat Mark Kelly this fall.\u201d Trump\u2019s decision to endorse Masters aligns him, in this race at least, with the Club for Growth, which has been at odds with the former President in other contests. In the Ohio GOP Senate primary, for example, the club backed former state treasurer Josh Mandel and refused to end its negative ad campaign against Vance even after he earned the former President\u2019s endorsement. \u201cWhen Club for Growth Action and President Trump work together, real conservatives win, and that\u2019s exactly what will happen in Arizona,\u201d David McIntosh, president of Club for Growth Action, said in a statement Thursday welcoming Trump\u2019s endorsement of Masters. But the campaign arm of Senate Democrats said Trump\u2019s move would exacerbate divisions in the GOP primary. \u201cNow his endorsement will only intensify this intra-party fight, just like it has in GOP Senate primaries across the country \u2013 leaving whichever candidate limps out of their primary badly damaged and on the wrong side of the voters who will decide the general election,\u201d Patrick Burgwinkle, a spokersperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement. Kelly, who won a special election in 2020 for the remaining two years of the late GOP Sen. John McCain\u2019s term, is unopposed in the Democratic primary as he seeks a full six-year term. The Arizona primary elections are scheduled for August 2. This story has been updated with additional reaction and background. CNN\u2019s Terence Burlij and Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It has been a year of difficult choices for families in California\u2019s 22nd Congressional District \u2013 a place Democrats have long eyed as one of their top pickup opportunities as they look to hold onto the US House in this fall\u2019s midterms. But as the Golden State contends with the highest gas prices in the nation heading next Tuesday\u2019s primaries, the financial pain felt by families is overshadowing every other issue. Yessenia Maldonado, a 46-year-old dental assistant and single mom of six, makes weekly calculations of what she must give up in exchange for one extra gallon of gas. \u201cAm I going to buy the milk for my kids or am I going to buy the gas to go to work? Because it\u2019s kind of the same price,\u201d she said during a recent grocery trip to Costco, adding that she now limits her drives to the essential trips. Feliciano Diaz, a-45-year-old truck driver, said he has scaled back on activities for his 14-year-old and a 10-year-old, like guitar lessons, and is now also halting long-planned home projects \u201cbecause we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening\u201d and how long the gas price spike will last. The 4 most interesting kinds of House primaries in 2022 Mary Conrad, 69, resorted to applying for food stamps as she tries to get by on her Social Security and disability checks. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough money, so I\u2019m charging my credit cards to eat,\u201d Conrad said as she set out on a shopping trip on a recent Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m making the payments, but the balances keep going up.\u201d All three said they don\u2019t see anything happening in Washington to address their concerns. The frustration with the party in power is palpable, a foreboding sign for Democrats in districts like this one where the party had hoped their recruit, state Assemblyman Rudy Salas, could unseat GOP Rep. David Valadao, who won his seat back in 2020 at the same time President Joe Biden was carrying it after losing it in 2018. When the nonpartisan redistricting commission drew its final lines for the Golden State last year, Democrats viewed California as a treasure trove of opportunities with as many as eight to 10 competitive House races up and down the state. The new 22nd District topped that list after the new lines created a tougher path for Valadao by removing some Republican portions of the district. To Democratic strategists, Valadao initially looked even more vulnerable because he had voted to impeach former President Donald Trump after the January 6, 2021, insurrection, which angered some GOP voters. But out of the six House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump and are running for reelection, Valadao is the only one the former President has not yet endorsed against. The first test of Valadao\u2019s strength within his own party will come in Tuesday\u2019s primary, which will be determined by California\u2019s \u201cjungle primary\u201d rules where the top-two finishers advance to the November election regardless of party. He\u2019s being challenged on his right flank by former Fresno City Council member Chris Mathys, who took on the congressman because of his impeachment vote. Mathys sued the state after it rejected his request to be identified as a \u201cTrump Conservative/Businessman\u201d on the ballot. Democrats will be closely watching to see how Salas finishes in the primary as they try to determine whether their party\u2019s voters are motivated to cast ballots in this sour economic climate. With inflation showing no signs of abating \u2013 and gas prices in the state topping an average of $6.15 per gallon on Memorial Day \u2013 Democrats\u2019 success increasingly hinges on the ability of candidates like Salas, who has been one of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s top recruits, to show frustrated voters that they understand the economic pain and are trying to address it. Democrats\u2019 hopes of winning the 22nd District rest on voters like Conrad and Diaz, who both said they lean left but see few solutions from the party to address inflation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about doing things, but it\u2019s not getting done,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cI want to look for another option,\u201d said Diaz, who said he is also troubled by the level of financial assistance that the US has sent to Ukraine at a time when American families are struggling with basic costs. \u201cI understand that we have to help other countries like Ukraine, but also we need the government to put more attention on our own problems like inflation.\u201d Maldonado says she\u2019s essentially tuned out politics because she doesn\u2019t trust either side to help. \u201cEverybody says one thing, but then they end up doing nothing at all or end up doing something different,\u201d she said. As the son of a field crew supervisor who earned extra money for his school clothes by picking grapes and kiwifruit as a kid when one of his dad\u2019s workers didn\u2019t show up, Salas seemed particularly well suited to speak to these voters as he leans in to his working-class roots. He won his Assembly races in part by fashioning himself as a moderate, independent voice for the Central Valley. His key proof point was his break with Democrats in April 2017 when he voted against raising the state\u2019s gasoline excise tax, a measure that was part of a broader transportation package to dedicate more money to road repairs and other projects. With Salas\u2019 defection, Democrats scrambled to meet the minimum two-thirds margin needed to pass the measure. Angry party leaders stripped Salas of his chairmanship on the Assembly\u2019s Business and Professions Committee, which oversees licensing and certain consumer regulations like product labeling. \u201cI knew they were going to punish me,\u201d Salas told CNN. But he said he kept thinking of people on fixed incomes who didn\u2019t have the extra margin to pay more for gas. \u201cI had direct conversations with the governor at the time too \u2013 and I was just telling him, \u2018Look, this plan does nothing for people in the Valley that have to drive to do everything. We have to drive to drop our kids off at school. We have to drive to get to a grocery store. For us, we have no option but to drive.\u2019\u201d Salas recalled how the vote created havoc on the Assembly floor. But later, he said, \u201cI had people just stop by the office, come by just wanting to shake my hand \u2013 all parties, Democrats, Republicans, independents.\u201d As much as that moment has figured in Salas\u2019 political biography, his Republican critics are looking to poke holes in his argument. They point to several Republican-driven votes that Salas missed earlier this year that were aimed at suspending California\u2019s gas excise tax for six months. It is the highest in the country at 51-cents-per-gallon and slated to rise automatically on July 1. 'It's getting worse every time': Inflation concerns could spell trouble for Democrats Democrats have resisted calls to suspend it, arguing that the savings from slashing it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be passed on to consumers \u2013 as they say that help should come in other forms like tax refunds through Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s $18 billion \u201cinflation relief package.\u201d While Valadao has not been particularly visible on the campaign trail, he is seeking political advantage on the issue of gas prices \u2013 spearheading letters to Newsom from Republicans in California\u2019s congressional delegation urging him to suspend the gas tax. A recent Valadao campaign ad charges that Biden\u2019s policies are \u201ccosting us more for gas and groceries,\u201d and says the congressman is \u201cleading the fight to suspend the gas tax so families can keep more of what they earn.\u201d Valadao\u2019s campaign did not respond to repeated requests from CNN for an interview to discuss his plans to address both gas prices and inflation. But Robert Jones, an adviser to Valadao, took aim at the recent votes that Salas missed, charging that he has not been \u201chonest with the voters about where he really is\u201d on that issue. \u201cHe has one vote in the distant past to point to and every other time he had a chance (to suspend the gas tax) he did not have the courage to do it on the floor in Sacramento,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe reason voters have supported David (Valadao) throughout the years \u2013 and what they\u2019re looking for in a representative \u2013 is somebody who\u2019s willing to stand up to their party and take the tough voters. Rudy has no history of that. When tough votes come around, Rudy sticks his finger in the air and changes his vote in the dead of night. That\u2019s not leadership.\u201d Salas\u2019 campaign manager Abby Olmstead pushed back on that characterization. \u201cRudy Salas was the only Democrat who voted against increasing the gas tax when it was originally proposed,\u201d she said. She pointed to his vote in the Assembly last week to bring up a bill that would have suspended the gas tax for one year. (At the time the measure failed last Wednesday, Salas was recorded as not voting, but he later amended his vote to register his support for the maneuver as permitted by the Assembly\u2019s rules). As Democrats nationally struggle to find the right message on inflation and gas prices, Salas trades sticker shock stories with people he meets as he drives his Ford F-150 truck around his agricultural and predominantly Latino district, often noting how much it cost him to fill up his tank at Costco and highlighting policies like the cost of living adjustments that he has proposed in the Assembly. At a time when other Democrats, including Newsom, have talked about finding pathways to phase out oil extraction in places like Kern County \u2013 a major driver of the economy in the Central Valley and jobs in the 22nd District \u2013 Salas also prides himself on defending the six-figure positions tied to the industry. He often takes California lawmakers on tours to see the local oil derricks that dot city parks here, as well as to a bluff overlooking the massive Kern River Oil Field. (Kern County contains the majority of active wells in the state). Salas says he challenges fellow Democrats who want to phase out that drilling by asking them to think about the alternatives, including bringing oil in by tanker from overseas from countries with far less environmental regulation. White House unveils a monthlong focus on the economy as prices rise and poll numbers fall \u201cYou want me to put all these people out of a job, for something that actually is worse for the environment? That doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d Salas said. While he has promised to focus on issues like expanding health care and finding compromise on immigration in Congress, Salas\u2019 pitch to voters is hyper-local \u2013 projects they \u201ccan see and touch\u201d from his time on the Bakersfield City Council and in the Assembly. That includes some of the most basic tasks that lured him into politics \u2013 like getting dirt sidewalks paved and adding streetlights and playground equipment to the areas where he grew up, but also his efforts to help save a local hospital that was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, and obtaining funding for research into valley fever, a disease that is caused by the inhalation of fungal spores that grow in the soil and can be lifted into the air by wind and other disturbances. A new six-figure ad buy to bolster Salas from House Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC tied to House leadership, illustrates that local focus, highlighting his advocacy for higher teacher pay and access to clean drinking water, which has been a major problem in this region. When asked which of the President\u2019s accomplishments, or what aspects of the Biden agenda, he plans to focus on in his campaign, Salas replied, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find them. We\u2019re just focused on the issues here locally.\u201d \u201cPeople want somebody that they can talk to, that understands what they\u2019re going through,\u201d he said. And while that strategy may make midterm campaigns like Salas\u2019 feel more like a mayoral race than a congressional contest, keeping Washington at a distance may be the safest play this year for Democrats trying to distance themselves from Biden\u2019s low approval ratings.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s rare for anyone in Washington to admit they were wrong. So Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s admission in an exclusive interview Tuesday on CNN that she was incorrect to believe last year that inflation was not a long-term threat was quite a moment. The administration could have gotten credit for candor and an unusual expression of humility, but a Treasury spokesperson soon tried to paper over Yellen\u2019s admission, instead emphasizing the unforeseen events that exacerbated inflation, which Yellen had also detailed on CNN. White House unveils a monthlong focus on the economy as prices rise and poll numbers fall \u201cI think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,\u201d Yellen told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer when asked about comments from 2021 that inflation posed only a \u201csmall risk.\u201d \u201cAs I mentioned, there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I, at the time, didn\u2019t fully understand, but we recognize that now,\u201d Yellen said. Yellen\u2019s statement appeared to be a symptom of a deep political hole facing the White House five months before the midterm elections. Telling Americans that the economy is strong, there are 8.3 million new jobs and inflation should be lower by the end of the year isn\u2019t working for President Joe Biden. But Yellen\u2019s honesty aside, Biden\u2019s intractable position was only reinforced Tuesday by the fact that much of his team\u2019s new PR blitz \u2013 designed to show the President feels the country\u2019s pain \u2013 doubled down on the same failed formula and a message to voters that while the anguish they are feeling from higher prices is real, the economy is doing better than they think. The White House isn\u2019t lying. The economy is mostly in good shape, especially considering the punishing impact of a once-in-a-century pandemic and the disastrous impact of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and Covid-19 lockdowns in China. Consumers are still spending despite higher prices and there are signs of a summer travel boom as the coronavirus appears less of a threat. But the highest inflation rates since the early 1980s mean that Americans generally are not feeling what the President says is happening. This kind of disconnect is politically unsustainable. Consumers are feeling less confident about the economy, but they're still spending A new Gallup poll on Tuesday, for instance, underscored the gloom felt by many US adults over the state of the economy \u2013 in a way that threatens to doom Democrats in November\u2019s midterm elections and hand Republicans power in Congress. Only 1% of those polled thought the current economic conditions were excellent; 13% said they were good; 39% said conditions were only fair; and a devastating 46% judged the situation as poor. And 77% of respondents said the country\u2019s economic outlook is getting worse. It\u2019s hard to imagine a less favorable political environment for a party that controls the House, the Senate and the White House and faces congressional elections. Republicans may not have announced any plans to do better. But the joy of opposition is that they can sit back and watch the slow-moving nightmare afflicting the party in power. Given this backdrop, it\u2019s not surprising the White House is launching a monthlong focus on the economy, designed to convince the country that high prices crimping family budgets are the President\u2019s number one priority, despite the largest war in Europe since World War II and a pandemic reluctant to release its grip. Senior administration officials fanned out across cable television on Tuesday to bolster Biden\u2019s argument, laid out in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, that his upbringing in a family that suffered when gasoline and food prices rose meant he especially understands what the country is going through now. But consider these dueling scenes. Drivers setting out on the Memorial Day weekend, which traditionally marks the start of summer, stared back at pumps showing near-record average prices just shy of $4.60 for a gallon of gas. Joe Biden wants to show he's in charge of inflation ... while showing someone else is in charge The day after the holiday, Biden welcomed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to the Oval Office and stressed that he would get out of the way and give the central bank room to do its job in curbing inflation. \u201cMy job as President is not \u2026 only (to) nominate highly, highly qualified individuals for that institution, but to give them the space they need to do their job. I\u2019m not going to interfere with their critically important work,\u201d Biden said on Tuesday. It\u2019s not hard to see that the sense of urgency voters are feeling might not be satisfied by such a staid photo op. Biden\u2019s approach may demonstrate the kind of good governance and respect for the Fed\u2019s independence that was noticeably lacking in the chaotic Trump administration. But as a political strategy, putting the onus on a body that is being widely criticized for waiting too long to raise interest rates in order to tackle inflation seems unlikely to shift voter perceptions. Biden supporters might complain that such critiques are rooted in punditry. But the administration\u2019s problem is one of perception, as voters fail to see the strengths of the economy the President tries to stress. The White House\u2019s case is not helped by the fact that like the Fed, it suffers from tarnished credibility on inflation, after repeatedly insisting last year that rising prices for food and other goods were \u201ctransitory.\u201d It\u2019s fair to argue, as Yellen did on CNN, that unforeseen factors, including the war in Ukraine and China\u2019s failure to shake off Covid-19, which has caused new supply chain reactions, were unexpected shocks that made previous predictions wrong. Such honesty from Yellen about not fully understanding the impact of those shocks is refreshing in a public official. But such nuance won\u2019t fly on the midterm election campaign trail, which history suggested was always going to be inhospitable for Democrats but is now looking dire. Republicans are certain to take her comments and frame an argument that even Biden\u2019s Treasury secretary admits his economic policies are not working. Part of the problem for the administration is that it has already used the items in its political arsenal that can be deployed without a significant cost. Biden has released millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves to combat rising energy prices sparked by the war in Ukraine. But pump prices keep going up. Blaming the increase on \u201cPutin\u2019s price hike,\u201d as the President has done, might feel good politically. But it doesn\u2019t do anything for angry drivers. Biden has also made significant efforts to reduce port congestion fueled by a supply chain crunch that followed the pandemic, when problems with supplies and high consumer demand caused inflation to skyrocket. But he can\u2019t control what happens outside the US, and the global factors that caused the problem are still playing out. Additionally, expected shortages of grain and sunflower oil brought on by a disrupted harvest and transportation of crops out of Ukraine, a major producer, later this year are threatening food shortages and higher prices closer to Election Day. Some analysts have suggested that the President could mitigate some of the pain of inflation by ending Trump-era tariffs on China or by encouraging more immigration to stem labor shortages that are contributing to higher prices. But either approach would expose Democrats to Republican claims that they are soft on China or are simply throwing the county\u2019s borders open. Both charges would be misleading, but they might well pay off for the GOP politically. In his Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden touted several measures in his stalled domestic agenda that he said would help cool the cost of living. He called on Congress to pass clean energy tax credits that he said would lower a typical family\u2019s utility bills by $500 a year. He also said family budgets could be helped by lowering the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and argued that reducing the federal budget deficit could help ease price pressures. The problem, however, is that all these measures will take time or require action by Congress. Much of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda has been stalled \u2013 not just by Republican obstruction but by his inability to convince the Democrats in the Senate to unite to pass it. One moderate Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has specifically named inflation as the reason he\u2019s not keen on extra government spending. Given Biden\u2019s limited options, the White House has little choice but to do what it set out to do yet again on Tuesday: Remind Americans of the strengths of the economy, job growth and the relative health of the position in the US compared with those of some foreign nations. None of this is likely to cut through, given voters\u2019 dire perceptions of how tough things really are. But Biden has few other options.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said if he will run for president again, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping him from privately musing about his potential running mate if he does. The latest person to catch his eye: Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the moderate-turned-MAGA star who has developed a strong relationship with the former President, according to multiple GOP sources with direct knowledge of the matter. While talk about a 2024 vice presidential pick is of course premature, conversations about adding Stefanik to a future Trump ticket have gained steam in recent weeks at Mar-a-Lago and in other Republican circles, sources said. Current and former advisers and others in Trump\u2019s orbit have privately argued that the New York Republican, who replaced Rep. Liz Cheney as the no. 3 House Republican last year, is a fierce and loyal attack dog, and Trump would benefit from tapping a woman for vice president should he run again. Donald Trump had a rough night in Georgia Two people familiar with the matter said Trump has been surveying close friends and allies on what they think of Stefanik, one of several Republican women he is possibly eyeing for the potential VP slot, though he has not ruled out a few male contenders, too. One of these people said the former President believes Stefanik has undergone a genuine transformation \u2013 leaving the moderate wing of the party to join its increasingly powerful \u201cAmerica First\u201d flank. \u201cThere is a part of Trump who thinks he needs a female VP. He definitely likes her, likely because of how effusive she is to him,\u201d one Trump adviser said. Chris Ruddy, a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s, echoed a similar sentiment. \u201cPresident Trump thinks very highly of Elise Stefanik. \u2026 She has been talked about in circles close to him as a potential vice presidential,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a feeling among a lot of people on the Republican side that they need to have a woman on the ticket this time.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Stefanik would be interested in serving as Trump\u2019s running mate, but it\u2019s clear she has ambitions beyond on her current role in leadership: she has been eyeing the GOP whip job if Republicans win the House majority next year. She could also make a play for the top spot on the House Education and Labor Committee, according to GOP lawmakers familiar with Stefanik\u2019s thinking. Having Trump\u2019s support could boost Stefanik in whatever she decides to do, especially inside a conference that is still deferential to the ex-President. Stefanik\u2019s camp, however, said in a statement to CNN that she is solely focused on her job as conference chair, representing her district and helping win back the majority. \u201cCongresswoman Stefanik is 100% focused on serving New York\u2019s 21st Congressional District and as House Republican Conference Chair helping lead the efforts to take back the House in 2022 to fire Nancy Pelosi once and for all to save America,\u201d said Alex DeGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik. The early discussions could be a signal that Trump is getting more serious about launching a White House bid. But Trump is also known to relish a lengthy tryout process that mimics \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d where contenders are vying for his affection. Dozens of 2022 Republican have already encountered this approach in their quests for his endorsement this election cycle. Plus, Trump has been trying to stay relevant by his racking up a string of victories in the midterms \u2013 especially after suffering his most stinging rebuke yet in the Georgia GOP gubernatorial primary this week, where his candidate, former Sen. David Perdue, lost to Gov. Brian Kemp, who refused to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election results. Stefanik\u2019s addition to an informal list of potential running mates, which will certainly be in flux over the next two years, comes as her stock has been rising in Trumpworld. One of the people familiar with Trump\u2019s discussions about Stefanik said a female House Republican, especially one who has been in the party\u2019s leadership ranks, may be a wise choice if Trump decides to run on an aggressive policy agenda in 2024, noting that Stefanik would have preexisting relationships on Capitol Hill that might benefit his future legislative priorities. Opinion: Georgia signals that Trump's days playing kingmaker are over If Stefanik doesn\u2019t make the cut for Trump\u2019s short list, he would likely consider other women for his ticket, advisers said. \u201cI could see Trump convincing himself he needs to pick a female VP to help with his suburban women problem,\u201d one of the Trump advisers said. Other Republican women whose names have floated around Trump\u2019s orbit so far include South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, and Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn. For now, the former President will host another big-ticket fundraiser for Stefanik next month at his golf club in Westchester, according to an invite obtained by CNN, making it the fourth such campaign event he has held for the House GOP conference chair. Trump also has used his own list of supporters to raise money for Stefanik, which is rare for the ex-President. And he has told people around him that he thinks Stefanik, 37, is a \u201ckiller\u201d and has a bright future, while publicly, he has suggested she could be president herself one day. \u201cI want to congratulate Elise on her success. Man is she moving fast. That means at this rate she\u2019ll be President in about 6 years,\u201d Trump said at a fundraiser earlier this year, according to the New York Post. Stefanik has been on Trump\u2019s radar since his first impeachment in 2019, when she raised her national profile and became a fundraising powerhouse by becoming one of his fiercest public defenders. More recently, she leaned into the \u201cUltra MAGA\u201d label and has echoed hard-line rhetoric similar to Trump\u2019s, including blasting out campaign ads last fall that referred to immigration as a \u201cpermanent election insurrection.\u201d Stefanik has defended those ads to CNN, saying she was referring to \u201camnesty\u201d and has \u201cnever made a racist comment.\u201d And on January 6, 2021 she was one of the House Republicans who objected to certifying the 2020 election results \u2013 a key litmus test for Trump. Additionally, Stefanik recently teamed up with another Republican to introduce a bill that would \u201cexpunge\u201d Trump\u2019s second impeachment from his record. The congresswoman has been elevated for behavior once already: Trump helped recruit Stefanik to run for conference chairwoman after her predecessor, Cheney, voted to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6, 2021, insurrection. But there are still moments when Stefanik has caught Trump\u2019s attention for the wrong reasons. Recently, Stefanik \u2013 who sits on the House Armed Services Committee \u2013 voted in favor of a $40 billion bill to deliver aid to Ukraine amid Russia\u2019s ongoing deadly invasion of its neighbor. Several other Trump allies in the House \u2013 including Reps. Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Madison Cawthorn \u2013 opposed the legislation, while the former President blasted the bill as \u201ca national disgrace\u201d in a statement days after it passed the House. One Trump ally said the former President wasn\u2019t pleased to see that Stefanik had supported the bill. Some of the Trump advisers who spoke to CNN said that picking Stefanik as a running mate would be a mistake if the former President launches a 2024 campaign, noting her past voting record might turn off the right while her more recent behavior may have alienated moderates and independents. Stefanik came up in politics through the GOP establishment, working as a White House aide for former President George W. Bush and then as a staffer for former Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s vice presidential campaign, when he ran alongside Mitt Romney. She also voted against the GOP\u2019s 2017 tax law, Trump\u2019s signature legislative achievement.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s election day again with primary races and runoffs taking place Tuesday in five states: Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. Senate primaries are taking place in Georgia \u2013 a key state in the fight for control of the chamber \u2013 as well as in Alabama and Arkansas. The three states are also hosting gubernatorial primaries that will be closely watched, while Texas holds primary runoffs in key races for state attorney general and the US House. And there are several other House primaries worth keeping an eye on, including races expected to be competitive in the fall; intraparty contests for seats seen as safe for either party; and a special primary election in Minnesota. Here\u2019s everything you need to know: In Georgia, incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp faces a primary challenge from former US Sen. David Perdue. Former President Donald Trump, angry at Kemp\u2019s role in certifying the 2020 election in the Peach State, is supporting Perdue, but recent polling has shown Kemp with a big lead. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who also earned Trump\u2019s ire for defending the 2020 election results, faces several challengers, including Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice. Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker, a former football star, are expected to win their primaries Tuesday to face off in a key Senate contest this fall. In Alabama, there\u2019s a three-way race in the GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby. Trump previously endorsed Rep. Mo Brooks but rescinded that endorsement in March. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey faces several primary challengers in her bid for a second full term. In Arkansas, former Trump White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is expected to win the GOP nomination for governor and would be a big favorite in November to win the office previously held by her father, Mike Huckabee. The state\u2019s senior senator, Republican John Boozman, also faces several primary challengers Tuesday. In all three states, candidates need to win a majority of the vote to avoid runoffs. There are also a number of primary runoff elections in Texas. Controversial state Attorney Gen. Ken Paxton, who is seeking a third term, faces off against Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the grandson of former President George H. W. Bush. Paxton finished ahead of Bush, 43% to 23%, in the first round in March. In South Texas, moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar, whose home and campaign office were searched by the FBI in January, was forced into a runoff by progressive immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros, whom he narrowly defeated in a 2020 primary. Abortion rights have become a key issue in the race, with Cuellar the only House Democrat to vote against legislation that would codify abortion rights into federal law. And in Minnesota, there\u2019s a special primary election to fill the seat of the late Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn. The crowded field of candidates looking to serve the remainder of Hagedorn\u2019s term include his widow and former chair of the Minnesota Republican Party, Jennifer Carnahan. You can follow along with results on CNN.com. CNN\u2019s decision desk will be monitoring results and will make projections accordingly. In Georgia, polls close at 7 p.m. ET. Mail-in ballots must be returned by close of polls Tuesday. In Alabama, polls close at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. ET. Mail-in ballots must have been returned by hand by Monday or received by mail by noon Tuesday. In Arkansas, polls close at 8:30 p.m. ET. Mail ballots must have been returned by hand by May 20 or by mail by close of polls Tuesday. In Texas, polls close at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. ET. Absentee ballots must be postmarked by 7 p.m. on Tuesday and returned by May 25 at 5 p.m. In Minnesota, polls close at 9 p.m. ET. All ballots must be received by the county board of elections by close of polls on Tuesday, but ballots delivered by hand must be returned by 3 p.m. Tuesday.

            "article_content": "It\u2019s Election Day in Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota (well, at least in the latter\u2019s 1st Congressional District). The Republican primaries for governor and Senate in Georgia have captured national attention, with former President Donald Trump flexing his endorsement muscle for former US Sen. David Perdue, who is challenging incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp, and for former football star Herschel Walker, who is the front-runner for the GOP Senate nomination. The Republican primary for the open Senate seat in Alabama is likely heading to a June runoff, with none of the leading candidates expected to secure a majority of the primary vote Tuesday. In March, Trump rescinded his endorsement of US Rep. Mo Brooks in that race. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, is favored to win her primary in her bid for a second full term, potentially without a runoff. Arkansas GOP Sen. John Boozman, who has Trump\u2019s backing as he seeks a third term, will be hoping to avoid a runoff in Tuesday\u2019s primary that features three challengers. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as press secretary in the Trump White House, is favored to win the Republican primary for Arkansas governor, an office her father, Mike Huckabee, held from 1996 to 2007. There are also key US House primaries taking place Tuesday, especially in Georgia and Texas, where the top two vote-getters from the Lone Star State\u2019s March 1 primaries face off in runoffs. There are also competitive primaries for seats seen as safe for either party, where the winners will be overwhelming favorites in November. And in Minnesota, voters in the 1st Congressional District will pick their nominees in the special election for the seat of the late Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn. House elections are taking place under new congressional lines that were redrawn in redistricting following the 2020 census. Republicans drew the new maps in Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and Texas. The special election in Minnesota \u2013 which is for the term that ends in January 2023 \u2013 is taking place under the existing boundaries. Here\u2019s a look at the House races we\u2019re watching Tuesday: Longtime Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop is running for a 16th term representing this southwestern Georgia district that became slightly less Democratic in redistricting but still would have backed Joe Biden by 10 points. Republicans are targeting the seat this cycle, and their fundraising leader in the primary is Army veteran Jeremy Hunt, a West Point graduate who was recently recognized as an \u201con the radar\u201d candidate by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Hunt is among several Black Republicans running for Congress this year in competitive seats. Two-term Democratic incumbent Lucy McBath opted to run in the neighboring 7th District after redistricting transformed her suburban Atlanta seat from one that backed Biden by 11 points to one that Trump would have won by 15 points. The winner of the nine-way Republican primary will be the favorite for the general election, but it remains to be seen if a candidate will be able to win without a runoff. Emergency room doctor and Marine veteran Rich McCormick, who narrowly lost a bid for the 7th District in 2020, and Trump-endorsed attorney Jake Evans, the former chairman of Georgia\u2019s State Ethics Commission, are seen as the front-runners on the GOP side. Other Republicans running include former state Rep. Meagan Hanson and self-described \u201cMaga Mom\u201d Mallory Staples. Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux was the only Democrat to flip a competitive US House seat in 2020. Biden carried her suburban Atlanta district under its current lines by 6 points, but he would have won the new version of the seat by by 26 points. McBath\u2019s decision to run for the redrawn seat sets up an incumbent-versus-incumbent primary with Bourdeaux. McBath, who has a national profile as an advocate for gun violence prevention, raised $4.4 million through May 4, compared with $3.2 million for Bourdeaux. The presence of state Rep. Donna McLeod in the primary could mean this race heads to a runoff. With GOP Rep. Jody Hice running for Georgia secretary of state, several Republicans are looking to succeed him in this district east of Atlanta that stretches to the South Carolina border. The primary will offer a test of Trump\u2019s endorsement power \u2013 former Democratic state Rep. Vernon Jones, who switched parties in 2021, ended his bid for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in February and switched to the 10th District race with Trump\u2019s backing. But Jones has lagged in fundraising, bringing in $337,000 through May 4. Businessman Mike Collins, the son of the late Georgia GOP Rep. Mac Collins, is the fundraising leader, raising $1.1 million through May 4, including a $531,000 personal loan. This is Collins\u2019 second bid for the seat after losing in a primary runoff to Hice in 2014. Other Republicans seeking the party nod include former state Revenue Commissioner David Curry and businessman Marc McMain, both of whom have partly self-funded their campaigns, and former US Rep. Paul Broun, who held this seat before Hice. The winner of the GOP primary would be favored for November in a seat Trump would have carried by 23 points in 2020. Democratic Rep. David Scott, a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition, narrowly avoided a primary runoff in 2020 against a progressive challenger, and he again faces primary challenges from his left this cycle, including from former state Sen. Vincent Fort, who is backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But Scott has held a commanding edge in the money race, raising $1.4 million through May 4, compared with $87,000 for Fort. The winner of the Democratic primary should not have much difficulty in the general election in a district in the southwestern Atlanta suburbs that Biden would have won by 59 points. Controversial Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene holds a significant fundraising advantage over her five primary opponents in her bid for a second term representing this northwest Georgia district. While Greene raised almost $12 million through May 4, her nearest GOP challenger, health care consultant Jennifer Strahan, brought in $392,000. Strahan has the support of some GOP outside groups, but it remains to be seen if that will be enough to overcome Greene, who has cultivated a national following and beat back a bid by voters and advocacy groups to keep her off the ballot over her alleged role in the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. On the Democratic side, Army veteran Marcus Flowers has raised more than $8 million through May 4, but the Democratic nominee is unlikely to be a factor in November in a district that would have backed Trump by 37 points in 2020. Democratic Rep. Vincente Gonzalez\u2019s decision to run for a more Democratic-leaning neighboring seat has opened up this South Texas district, where Republicans will be hoping to consolidate their gains with Hispanic voters. Redistricting transformed the seat from one that Trump lost by 2 points in 2020 to one he would have carried by 3 points. His endorsed candidate, 2020 nominee Monica De La Cruz, won the Republican nomination in March. The Democratic primary will be decided in a Tuesday runoff between progressive activist Michelle Vallejo and Army veteran Ruben Ramirez, who also ran for the seat in 2016. Progressive immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros forced moderate Rep. Henry Cuellar into a runoff after neither candidate crossed the 50% threshold in the March primary for this South Texas seat. The third-place finisher in that race, Tannya Benavides, has endorsed Cisneros. Cuellar made headlines in January when his home and campaign office were searched by the FBI. He has denied any wrongdoing and his attorney said last month that the congressman was not a target of the probe. The issue of abortion rights has come to the forefront of the campaign, with Cisneros attacking Cuellar\u2019s record as the only House Democrat to vote against legislation that would codify abortion rights into federal law. Cuellar maintains the support of top House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. Redistricting made the district more Democratic \u2013 Biden would have carried the redrawn version by 7 points \u2013 but Republicans sense an opening after recent gains with Latino voters in South Texas. The GOP nominee will also be decided in a runoff Tuesday: Cassy Garcia, a former staffer to Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, faces Sandra Whitten, the 2020 nominee who lost to Cuellar by 19 points. Longtime Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson\u2019s retirement has opened up this deep-blue Dallas-area seat. State Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a civil rights attorney who was recruited to run by Johnson, narrowly missed winning the primary outright in March when she finished with 48.5% of the vote. She faces Jane Hope Hamilton, a longtime Democratic aide and campaign adviser, in Tuesday\u2019s runoff. Crockett is backed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC and other progressive groups, including the Working Families Party and Our Revolution. Hamilton\u2019s supporters include her former boss, US Rep. Marc Veasey, who represents a neighboring district, and former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk. The winner would be heavily favored in November in a seat Biden would have carried by 57 points. The Republican primary for this deep-red northern Alabama seat will likely decide the successor to GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, who is running for US Senate. Madison County Commission Chairman Dale Strong has led the money race, raising $1.1 million through May 4, including some self-funding. Army veteran Casey Wardynski, who was an assistant Army secretary under Trump and served as superintendent of Huntsville City Schools, raised about $553,000 through May 4, which also included some self-funding. Wardynski has the endorsement of the House Freedom Fund, the political arm of the House Freedom Caucus. With six candidates seeking the GOP nomination, the race could be heading for a June runoff if no one clears 50% of the vote Tuesday. Trump would have carried the district by 27 points in 2020. A number of candidates are running in the special primary election for the southern Minnesota seat left vacant by the death of Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn. Leading GOP hopefuls for the nomination include the late congressman\u2019s widow, Jennifer Carnahan, a former chair of the Minnesota Republican Party; state Rep. Jeremy Munson, who has the backing of the House Freedom Fund; and former state Rep. Brad Finstad, an ex-US Agriculture Department official who has benefited from spending by Defending Main Street PAC. Republicans are favored to hold the seat \u2013 Trump carried the district by 10 points in 2020. Democrats in the race include Jeff Ettinger, the former CEO of Hormel Foods, and Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. The primary winners will face off in an August special election to fill the remainder of Hagedorn\u2019s term. The regular primary election for a full term will also take place in August under new district lines.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Henry Cuellar, the long-time Laredo congressman backed by House leaders despite his status as the last Democratic opponent of abortion rights in the House, faces progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros for the third time Tuesday in a primary runoff in South Texas. Cisneros, who turns 29 on Tuesday, nearly defeated Cuellar in 2020. This year, backed by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a long list of leading progressive organizations, Democratic women\u2019s groups and labor unions, she again came close, finishing less than two percentage points behind Cuellar in the March primary. Since neither candidate topped 50%, they advanced to Tuesday\u2019s head-to-head runoff to represent Texas\u2019 28th Congressional District. The race is the clearest\u00a0test to date of whether the leaked draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade will motivate voters and push abortion rights to the forefront of the 2022 midterm election. 'This conversation has really started to dominate on politics up and down the ballot': How abortion rights has become the center of two Texas runoff races But it\u2019s also playing out in South Texas, in a district that stretches from San Antonio, a liberal area that makes up Cisneros\u2019 base, to more moderate Laredo and its surrounding Rio Grande Valley counties, where support for Cuellar runs deep. Democratic voters there are largely Latino and historically more culturally conservative \u2013 a reality that partially explains Cuellar\u2019s success there. It\u2019s also a region where Republicans made major gains with Latino voters in the 2020 election, offering a window into a trend that could carry major implications across the national political map if it continues. Another complicating factor is the FBI search of Cuellar\u2019s home in January, weeks before the March primary. Cuellar has insisted he has done nothing wrong, and his attorney said Cuellar is not the target of the FBI investigation. Still, Cisneros \u2013 an immigration attorney who interned in Cuellar\u2019s Washington office as a college student \u2013 has used it to make the case that Cuellar isn\u2019t focused on the interests of his district. \u201cIt took me having to be in Congressman Cuellar\u2019s office to find out that was anti-labor, to find out he was anti-choice, to find out he had lobbyist after lobbyist after lobbyist go through his office, and never really hosted families that looked like mine,\u201d she said at a rally Friday with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The runoff also marks the latest in a series of increasingly expensive clashes \u2013 following last week\u2019s primaries in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oregon \u2013 between progressive and moderate forces within the Democratic Party. The 4 most interesting kinds of House primaries in 2022 Big-dollar outside groups aligned with the moderates spent heavily, as they\u2019ve done in Texas, but received only a modest return on their investment: In Oregon\u2019s 5th District, Rep. Kurt Schrader, despite support from national Democrats and a PAC aligned with the pharmaceutical industry, is trailing primary challenger Jamie McLeod-Skinner. Pennsylvania state Rep. Summer Lee also appears to have overcome more than $3 million in super PAC spending to edge out her moderate rival for the nomination in the commonwealth\u2019s open 12th District race. In North Carolina, though, progressive favorites Nida Allam, the Durham County commissioner running in the 4th Congressional District, and former state Sen. Erica Smith, vying for a nomination in the 1st District, were handily defeated by moderate candidates bolstered by significant spending from dark money groups. The showdown in South Texas, in one of the most closely watched Democratic primaries of the cycle, has attracted a variety of big spenders, with a late push for Cisneros from EMILY\u2019s List following the Supreme Court leak. Divisions along ideological lines and the contentious relations between progressive groups and Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill have been cast in sharp relief by the clash over the Texas district. Cisneros called on Democratic congressional leaders to drop their support for Cuellar after the high court draft was first reported. Instead, they reaffirmed their support. Pelosi earlier this month called Cuellar a \u201cvalued member of our caucus.\u201d And House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland similarly defended Cuellar this month. \u201cWe\u2019re a diverse party and we have diverse opinions,\u201d Hoyer told reporters. \u201cWe are overwhelmingly in our platform sense, a pro-choice party. \u2026That does not mean there\u2019s not room in our party for alternative voices.\u201d \u201cI believe that Mr. Cuellar has represented his district well, his state well, I think he\u2019s a valuable member of our Congress, and I\u2019m supporting him for reelection,\u201d Hoyer said. Their continued support for Cuellar could help him avert disaster, but it has also reinforced Cisneros\u2019 outsider image. \u201cThe entire establishment in Washington \u2013 from Speaker Pelosi to (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) \u2013 has supported an anti-choice extremist and tried to stop Cisneros every step of the way,\u201d Justice Democrats communications director Waleed Shahid said. \u201cThis election is about sending a message to Washington that South Texas deserves a representative who isn\u2019t beholden to the corporate donors, super PACs and powers that be.\u201d Cuellar has been boosted by nearly $2 million alone from the United Democracy Project, which is funded by AIPAC. UDP spokesman Patrick Dorton said the group\u2019s message is unchanged from past primaries and made no apologies for its involvement. \u201cThe pro-Israel community will stand by its friends who support a strong U.S.-Israel relationship,\u201d he said, \u201cand confront those who are detractors of that relationship and would seek to undermine it.\u201d The new Mainstream Democrats PAC, which is backed LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, has also spent more than $750,000 to support Cuellar.",

            "article_content": "First lady Jill Biden on Monday wraps a six-day, three-country tour of Latin America with an agenda that focused \u2013 at times with subtlety and others with direct intent \u2013 on why a partnership with the United States has its benefits. \u201cAlone, you can only do so much.  Any one of us can only do so much,\u201d said Biden in remarks at the Ecuadorean presidential palace on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to talk to you about today: How when we work together, we can make our nations and our world stronger.\u201d Biden has \u2013 in the three capital cities of Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica \u2013 made remarks on a similar theme, tackling issues related to democracy, growth and political freedom. Her mission has been to shore-up relations with allies in a region rife with corruption and immigration issues, a topic her husband\u2019s administration has found controversial back home. A federal judge in Louisiana on Friday blocked the Biden administration from ending a Trump-era pandemic restriction, known as Title 42, at the US-Mexico border, thwarting plans to terminate the controversial public health authority. Since taking office, Biden\u2019s administration has continued to rely on Title 42, a public health authority invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic that allows border officials to turn migrants away at the US-Mexico border. Yet Jill Biden\u2019s message on her South and Central American trip was not \u201cdo not come,\u201d which Vice President Kamala Harris bluntly communicated during her visit last June to Mexico and Guatemala. Instead, Biden\u2019s tone was closer to \u201cstay where you are and reap the benefits of a US relationship.\u201d \u201c[Biden] understands the fine line she has to walk between serving as a goodwill emissary from the US promoting American values, and being a political actor herself,\u201d said Kate Andersen Brower, CNN contributor and author of \u201cFirst Women: The Grace and Power of America\u2019s Modern First Ladies.\u201d Throughout her travels this week, the first lady has dotted her stops with gifts of funding, announcements of aid and promises of support from America, combining cheery partnership sweet spots with the warning that \u2013 in a world of recent, ongoing and perhaps future challenges \u2013 it is better to have the US in your corner than not. \u201cInjustice and corruption, poverty and pollution, disease and despair. They aren\u2019t contained by any borders,\u201d Biden said in Ecuador, standing at a podium just feet from that country\u2019s president, Guillermo Lasso, having met privately with him for close to an hour earlier in the day. \u201cIf we learned anything from the Covid-19 pandemic, from these last few years of sickness and sorrow, it\u2019s how one deadly virus can move through the world. How hunger and violence are woven together. How a war in Europe can ripple through stock markets and supermarkets. And here, how the loss of trees in your Amazon can take a piece of the future from all of us.\u201d Biden left Ecuador the following day, after lighting a candle and touring Quito\u2019s largest church with first lady Maria de Lourdes Alcivar de Lasso. Yet what the goodwill photo ops did not reveal were new conversations on the margins between State Department officials and the Ecuadorean government, an opportunity for needed, behind-the-scenes engagement, which the first lady\u2019s trip provided. There are now ongoing negotiations for a bilateral agreement with Ecuador on migration and protection with countries throughout the region, a US official involved in the discussions told CNN. \u201cEcuador hosts large numbers of Venezuelan migrants and refugees,\u201d said the official. \u201cWe also discussed the importance of protection for this vulnerable group.\u201d According to an official at the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cMore than 6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants have fled their homes, making this the second-largest external displacement crisis in the world.\u201d Seventeen countries in Latin America and the Caribbean host approximately 80% of this Venezuelan diaspora, including large numbers in Ecuador. Costa Rica, a country of only 5 million people, is hosting approximately 150,000 Nicaraguan migrants, fleeing another country with a tenuous political climate, according to the official. \u201cThe first lady is the most visible woman in American politics,\u201d said Brower. \u201cBy showing interest in another region and using the unique soft power of her position to promote American values and democracy she can strengthen and even heal relationships.\u201d Brower also noted the position of a first lady, Biden especially, has become increasingly influential in high-stakes diplomatic scenarios. \u201cThere\u2019s a general acceptance that a first lady has the gravitas and clout to make a trip to a region critical to the US,\u201d said Brower. In Panama on Saturday, during a visit to an HIV/AIDS shelter home, funded by the US\u2019s PEPFAR program, the first lady announced an additional $80.9 million for PEPFAR in the region, including $12.2 million for Panama, which will be dedicated to expanding HIV/AIDS services and treatment, according to Biden\u2019s spokesman Michael LaRosa. \u201cI see this great community. I see how hard you\u2019re all working and, maybe with the additional funding that we will be announcing today, I\u2019m hoping that it makes a difference for you,\u201d said Biden, who participated in a roundtable discussion at the shelter, listening to the needs of a community which has received little monetary support for HIV/AIDS from its own country\u2019s government, according to statistics provided by the East Wing. The engagement of the PEPFAR program was done well before Biden\u2019s visit, said a White House official, though the announcement at the center was seen as a surprise. \u201cBottom line is that none of this travel is typically done in a vacuum - it\u2019s part of a strategic plan - or should be,\u201d said Anita McBride, director of the First Ladies Initiative at American University and Laura Bush\u2019s former chief of staff. At her third and final stop on the tour, Costa Rica, Biden on Saturday evening had dinner at the US ambassador\u2019s residence with Costa Rica\u2019s new president, Rodrigo Chaves, who has been in office for less than two weeks after a run-off election and was recently embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal from his years at the World Bank, and his wife, first lady Signe Zeicate. Zeicate met Biden\u2019s plane at the airport that afternoon, welcoming her American counterpart with a hug and joining her for events Saturday and Sunday. \u201cDiplomacy is about relationships. (Biden) builds a rapport with the first spouses and it matters, it helps to break the ice and establish some familiarity with each other, and in private moments share their husband\u2019s positions. They build some greater mutual understanding, hopefully,\u201d said McBride. At San Jos\u00e9\u2019s National Children\u2019s Hospital on Sunday, Zeicate seated in the front row of a small room where Biden was speaking. The first lady, in remarks to assembled media and local government officials, dropped the news that country\u2019s public health authority had recently entered a memorandum of understanding with the University of Pennsylvania and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, which, according to LaRosa, will boost research availability and, \u201chelp Costa Rican children access a lifesaving cancer treatment.\u201d \u201cNo country can defeat cancer alone,\u201d said Biden. \u201cIt takes all of us working together.\u201d Biden was introduced by US Ambassador to Costa Rica Cynthia Telles. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the first lady\u2019s visit to Costa Rica was the catalyst for finalizing the agreement,\u201d said Telles. CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Six weeks postpartum, Rochelle Garza was on the frontlines of an abortion rights rally in Dallas. \u201cI will be damned if my daughter grows up in a state where she cannot control her own body,\u201d the Democratic candidate for Texas attorney general said into a megaphone. Abortion rights had already been top of mind for Texas Democrats during the state\u2019s March 1 primary elections, as Democratic candidates and political operatives pointed to the Lone Star State\u2019s controversial six-week abortion ban as a warning sign for what life could look like in a post-Roe America. But, two months later, the issue became much more pressing: a Supreme Court draft majority opinion that would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision had been leaked. \u201cI know that everyone is angry. We should be angry because this is an attack on our health care. Because abortion is health care. Reproductive freedom is a human right,\u201d Garza said on May 3. In the weeks since then, abortion rights has become even more central to two key Texas runoff primaries. Voting will end in those races on Tuesday. In the runoff for the Democratic nomination for state attorney general, Garza, a civil rights attorney who previously won a case granting a detained 17-year-old immigrant the right to an abortion, is facing off against former Galveston mayor and trial attorney Joe Jaworski, who is also pro-abortion rights but lacks the same backing of abortion rights groups that Garza has. \u201cWomen and all people who care about equal rights, even if they\u2019re not women, should be angry, alarmed and motivated,\u201d Jaworski said in an interview with CNN Friday. \u201cReproductive choice, at least protected by the federal constitution, is over, and this ought to be a wake-up call, a motivating call for voters, whether you\u2019re a woman or not.\u201d The issue has also come to the forefront of the blockbuster Democratic primary runoff for Texas\u2019s 28th Congressional District, where Jessica Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration attorney, is facing Rep. Henry Cuellar. Cuellar, a political institution in South Texas, is the last remaining anti-abortion rights House Democrat and was the only member of his party in the lower chamber last fall to vote against the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would codify abortion rights even if the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade. Jamarr Brown, co-executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, told CNN that after the leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion, the party will be \u201cfollowing the primary runoff results to see if there are any indicators of this issue moving the electorate.\u201d \u201cThis issue is a reminder of what is at stake in this election \u2013 that we must fight extremism by Republicans in Texas and across the country when they attack our fundamental freedoms,\u201d Brown said. Days after the Supreme Court draft decision was leaked, Cisneros posted a video on Twitter asking Democratic leadership to retract their support for Cuellar. \u201cAt every turn, my congressman has stood in opposition to the Democratic Party agenda. From being anti-union to being anti-choice and with the House majority on the line, Cuellar could very much be the deciding vote on the future of reproductive rights in this country and we just cannot afford that risk,\u201d she said. Asked during a press conference earlier this month about her support for Cuellar, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi doubled down on her backing of the incumbent congressman, saying that while Cuellar is an abortion rights opponent, the Democratic Party was able to pass the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act without his vote. \u201cI\u2019m supporting Henry Cuellar. He\u2019s a valued member of our caucus,\u201d Pelosi said at a May 12 press conference, adding later, \u201cHe is not pro choice, but we didn\u2019t need him.\u201d Cuellar is also backed by House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, who stumped for Cuellar in San Antonio, Texas, the same day Cisneros released her statement asking for party leadership to reconsider their stance. For months, Cisneros has been talking about the differentiation between her and Cuellar when it comes to abortion rights. \u201cHe doubled down on his anti-choice stance and said abortion wasn\u2019t health care. This is why I\u2019m running, because our community deserves someone who will always fight tooth and nail for our health care,\u201d Cisneros previously told CNN in a statement. Cuellar, according to the Laredo Morning Times, said in a Zoom event last year that he had backed \u201cmillions of dollars on health care for women,\u201d but that abortion was \u201cnot a health issue.\u201d \u201cFor me,\u201d Cisneros said, \u201cknowing how many people are being affected and have lost their right to health care, you just can\u2019t be a bystander.\u201d \u201cAs a lifelong Catholic, I have always been pro-life. As a Catholic, I do not support abortion, however, we cannot have an outright ban. There must be exceptions in the case of rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother,\u201d Cuellar said in a statement after the draft opinion leaked. \u201cAdditionally, my faith does not allow me to support extreme positions such as late term or partial birth abortions. My faith is clear: abortion must be rare & safe,\u201d Cuellar said. CNN reached out to Cuellar\u2019s campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee but did not immediately receive a response for comment. Both Garza and Jaworski told CNN that if elected, they would not criminalize women for seeking an abortion or abortion providers. \u201cMy commitment is to fighting for everyone\u2019s constitutional right and being the people\u2019s attorney and looking out for the people, and that does include making sure that we do not criminalize women or providers or anyone for making a healthy decision. I make that commitment that I am not going to criminalize anyone or force criminality for someone making a decision for themselves,\u201d Garza said in an interview Thursday. Likewise, asked if he would criminalize people who sought an abortion or abortion providers in the state, Jaworski said, \u201cI would not.\u201d He added that he does not think prosecuting abortion is within the purview of the state\u2019s attorney general. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think it would be the Texas attorney general\u2019s province to initiate prosecution, even if I felt like doing it, which I don\u2019t,\u201d Jaworski said Friday, adding that he believes the decision will come down to \u201clocal decision making authority.\u201d As an attorney in private practice, Garza \u2013 who previously told CNN her candidacy for attorney general was in part inspired by Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban \u2013 fought in court against Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s efforts to insert himself in a case to help the Trump administration prevent her client, a detained 17-year-old immigrant, from accessing an abortion. Garza and the ACLU won that case. \u201cThis is what we need in the office. Somebody who practices what they preach. I\u2019m a civil rights lawyer,\u201d she said. For his part, Jaworski told CNN he is uniquely positioned to serve as attorney general because of his litigation experience. But Jaworski has never previously fought for abortion in court. \u201cI\u2019ve not had occasion to fight for reproductive choice in court, but I have had two major victories on difficult cases,\u201d Jaworski said, detailing cases regarding workers\u2019 rights and public housing in the state of Texas. Jaworski told CNN that he believes the issue of reproductive rights in Texas must be looked at from an equal rights perspective and could come down to the equal protection clause of the Texas constitution. He added that the fight for reproductive rights in Texas will require a sincere commitment to voting rights as well, in part due to Texans role in voting for state Supreme Court justices. The Democratic nominee will take on the victor of the Republican primary race. Paxton, who won reelection by under 4 percentage points in 2018, is seeking a third term this year and has a primary runoff of his own against George P. Bush to get through on Tuesday. Texans haven\u2019t elected a Democrat to a statewide office since 1994. The high-profile races have attracted the attention of national and local organizations, many of whom advocate for abortion rights. Both Cisneros and Garza are supported by EMILY\u2019s List, the influential Democratic political committee that backs pro- abortion rights women for public office. For its part, EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s independent expenditure arm \u201cWOMEN VOTE!\u201d has put out mailers, television ads and digital ads for Cisneros ahead of the runoff, Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications for EMILY\u2019s List, told CNN. While Reynolds noted the group\u2019s concerted push for Cisneros, she highlighted the work of the organization to support Cisneros during both of the past two cycles. EMILY\u2019s List also backed Cisneros in 2020, when she challenged Cuellar for the first time. Asked about whether or not the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion has changed the stakes of the race in Texas\u2019 28th congressional district, \u201cIt\u2019s not a new issue here. It potentially makes it more real that this is going to happen,\u201d Reynolds told CNN, referring to the possibility of a post-Roe America. \u201cBoth [Cisneros and Garza] talked about [abortion] beforehand, before the decision, and continue to talk about and raise with voters since the draft opinion leaked,\u201d she said. Additionally, Cisneros is backed by Planned Parenthood Action Fund, while Garza has the support of by Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, the local wing of the national abortion rights advocacy group. Dyana Limon-Mercado, executive director of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes emphasized that throughout the state, more Texans are talking about the need for abortion rights. \u201cWe know a majority of Americans already believe that Roe should stay in place and abortion should continue to be legal, even among Catholic voters, Hispanic voters, women of all socioeconomic backgrounds,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, what I think you see, is more different types of voters talking about it. Maybe people who their number one issue maybe has been education or the economy and other stuff like that, this conversation has really started to dominate on politics up and down the ballot.\u201d Ana Ramon, who is the interim executive director of Annie\u2019s List, a Texas-based group that backs progressive, pro-abortion rights women at the state level, told CNN that across the state, voters are emphasizing abortion rights as a top issue. \u201cWe have definitely heard of interesting conversations at the doors. It\u2019s more on the grassroots level where people are talking to our endorsed candidates about abortion and access,\u201d Ramon said. \u201cEverything is at stake, people\u2019s lives are at stake. We know that women and Texas families, they are more likely to die of gynecological cancers, gynecological disease, if they don\u2019t have access to the resources and services they need,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is no longer about policies it\u2019s about people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "America now has a President who will call evil by its name. But Joe Biden\u2019s pleas for citizens to unite in purging White supremacy, which he warned on Tuesday was poisoning the nation, were quickly undermined by a backlash from conservative media stars who accused him of exploiting the murder of 10 Black Americans in Buffalo by a right-wing extremist. The disconnect reflected how the aching polarization and tribalism of the country\u2019s politics preclude any hope of common ground, even after the horror that unfolded in a supermarket in the western New York city on Saturday. Far from bringing America together, every successive tragedy appears to pull it further apart. Biden traveled to Buffalo to mourn with the relatives of those killed by a gunman who allegedly drove 200 miles to massacre them while wallowing in a self-described stew of self-radicalization, racism and fascism. In a striking address, the President drew a line between racist massacres of Black, Hispanic and Jewish Americans in Charleston, South Carolina, El Paso, Texas, and Pittsburgh to spell out what is now awfully obvious. The United States faces a significant scourge of White supremacist extremism that erupts periodically and results in the mass, racially motivated murder of innocent people. The bile is being exacerbated by online propaganda and conspiracies that White Americans could be replaced by a tide of immigration. Such claims are often legitimized on conservative media and have been hinted at by some GOP politicians. \u201cWhat happened here is simple and straightforward \u2013 terrorism, terrorism, domestic terrorism, violence inflicted in the service of hate and the vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group,\u201d Biden said in an emotional speech laced with grief and anger. The President condemned a \u201chate\u201d percolating in politics, the media, and on the internet, which he said had convinced isolated individuals that they will be \u201creplaced\u201d by non-White immigrants. Biden was referring to the so-called great replacement theory, which follows false claims advanced by QAnon conspiracists that top Democrats are involved in a pedophile ring and the out-of-control lies now believed by millions of Americans that the 2020 election was stolen. It is just the latest sign of how deeply untruths and conspiracies have hijacked US politics. In the grieving city at the eastern end of Lake Erie, Biden didn\u2019t identify the specific culprits he blames for advancing that poison. But by the time he arrived back at the White House, he was coming closer to naming names. \u201cYou have folks on television stations talking about the replacement theory \u2013 they\u2019re scaring the living hell out of people who don\u2019t have a whole lot of emotional stability, taking advantage of \u2026 the internet and other means by talking about how we\u2019re going to be overtaken,\u201d Biden said at a reception honoring Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, a group that has also faced racial hate. Biden\u2019s sharp condemnation of those forces created a sharp contrast with the equivocation and linguistic fuzziness that his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, often showed when asked about White supremacy \u2013 and that still runs through conservative media. The amplification of great replacement theory rhetoric, sometimes used to fire up anger among the GOP activist base, has been especially notable on primetime Fox shows in recent months. There was no sign of a change of tone on the network on Tuesday following Biden\u2019s comments. Quite the opposite. Buffalo massacre further rattles an insecure nation Before Biden spoke, Fox host Tucker Carlson, who has repeatedly highlighted the fringe theory, said on Monday that a document attributed to the shooter, which dripped with references to great replacement theory, was not political at all and accused his critics of trying to shut down free speech rights. On Tuesday, he condemned a \u201cmurder spree by a demented teenager\u201d and accused Biden of trying to suppress the freedom of speech of millions of Americans. Another Fox host, Jesse Watters, said Tuesday that Biden was a \u201cDivider in Chief\u201d who hadn\u2019t healed the country as he had promised and who \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about the soul of America.\u201d He accused Biden of exploiting the tragedy to deflect from his own political woes. His colleague, Laura Ingraham, accused Biden of playing a \u201cdemonization game\u201d against conservative Americans to disguise his own low approval ratings and of ignoring gun violence in liberal cities like Chicago. The comments came after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, wrote to Rupert Murdoch and senior Fox executives imploring them to halt the propagation of great replacement theory segments on the network. There is no indication that specific Fox hosts influenced the alleged shooter in the Buffalo massacre, Payton Gendron, who is facing charges of first degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty. But the idea that network hosts have been amplifying similar theories to those that seem to have shaped the suspected shooter\u2019s beliefs underscores the chasm that cleaves US politics \u2013 and means that Biden\u2019s pleas are unlikely to be realized. Many Republican politicians have condemned the Buffalo massacre. But most have done so in vague terms and have not specifically called out the alleged White supremacist sentiments of the suspected shooter. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, for instance, said Tuesday that \u201cracism of any sort is abhorrent in America.\u201d But the Kentucky Republican did not address questions about some in his party using rhetoric akin to great replacement theory and suggested that the massacre in Buffalo was the work of a \u201ccompletely deranged young man.\u201d His reluctance reflected the difficulty some Republicans find in equivocally condemning views that have strong traction in a sector of the Republican base and that are advanced by media organizations that support Trump, who remains the dominant figure in the party and the likely frontrunner in the 2024 presidential primary. There is a clear pattern over the past four years of Republicans who do not share the authoritarian tastes of Trump nonetheless being unwilling to condemn his rhetoric for political gain. For instance, the campaign of GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 House Republican, last year ran a Facebook ad that suggested Democrats wanted a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to create a \u201cpermanent election insurrection\u201d to overthrow the electorate. Challenged by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Monday, Stefanik said she had \u201cnever made a racist statement,\u201d and said, \u201cI condemn racism.\u201d It is hardly a coincidence that Republicans who have already broken with Trump \u2013 over the January 6, 2021, insurrection and his election lies \u2013 found it much easier to point out the party\u2019s refusal to outright condemn White extremism. \u201cThe House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism,\u201d Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who was booted from GOP leadership and replaced with Stefanik, wrote on Twitter on Monday. The tolerance for White extremism in the GOP cannot be separated from the rise of Trump. After violence at White supremacists\u2019 2017 march in Charlottesville, Virginia, for example, the then-President suggested that there were \u201csome very fine people, on both sides.\u201d Trump said at the time that he was not sparing White nationalists or neo-Nazis from criticism but argued that not everyone in the crowd protesting the toppling of Civil War statues was evil. His comment suggested he was seeking to appease extremism while avoiding accusations that he was cosseting such behavior. Similarly, in a presidential debate in 2020, when asked to condemn White supremacists, Trump declined to clearly do so and told the far-right group the Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2016 with a hardline screed against Mexican immigrants. The undercurrent of much of his political rhetoric, back then and today, relies on a sense that outsiders are threatening American culture and history and that the rights and heritage of White citizens are under threat. By contrast, Biden\u2019s appeal to Americans to unite against the threat of White supremacy was a case of a President using his platform to make an appeal to the country\u2019s moral conscience. \u201cWe have to refuse to live in a country where Black people going about a weekly grocery shopping can be gunned down by weapons of war deployed in a racist cause,\u201d the President said in Buffalo. \u201cWe have to refuse to live in a country where fear and lies are packaged for power and for profit,\u201d he added in a clear swipe at Republicans and conservative media. But Democrats lack the power to pass laws in Washington, owing to the Senate filibuster, to try to stop future deadly shootings, like restricting the kind of weapon that was used in Saturday\u2019s attack. And Biden\u2019s calls for moderation on conservative media have already failed. In fact, they may be most effective in fueling critics\u2019 attacks that he is trying to restrict freedom of speech guarantees. Biden has attended sufficient memorials to know that his words alone \u2013 after yet another mass shooting \u2013 will not be able to quell the forces that cause such outbursts of hate. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not naive. I know tragedy will come again,\u201d he said in Buffalo.",

            "article_content": "Critics are drawing parallels between the pattern of racist gunmen citing fears of a conspiracy to \u201creplace\u201d Whites with rhetoric pushed on Fox and by some Republican politicians. The mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, on Saturday was not the first such event in recent years in which a White gunman, who allegedly posted a White supremacist manifesto online, targeted the Black or immigrant community. It\u2019s not the second. Or the third. Mass shooting at Buffalo supermarket was a racist hate crime, police say Overtly racist lone gunmen motivated by such hate have, in recent years, targeted a Black church in South Carolina, a synagogue in Pittsburgh, and immigrants at a Walmart in El Paso. Read CNN\u2019s report. Some apparently drew inspiration from a shooting by a White man in New Zealand who targeted mosques, killing 51, and published his own manifesto about \u201cThe Great Replacement.\u201d Now, Buffalo. Get the latest on: \u201cReplacement theory\u201d motivation \u2013 According to a 180-page document posted online, attributed to Gendron, he was fixated on what\u2019s known as \u201creplacement theory\u201d \u2013 the idea that Whites are being slowly and intentionally replaced by minorities and immigrants. Variations on this basic idea \u2013 that Whites are being replaced by some sort of minority-driven conspiracy \u2013 have made their way into more than just the musings of gunmen. The Fox and GOP version of replacement theory. Critics say it is dangerously close to xenophobic rhetoric finding its way into the mainstream of American politics. Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, pointed the finger squarely at her party\u2019s leadership Monday morning, saying it has \u201cenabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. @GOP leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them.\u201d And after the shooting in Buffalo, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the Illinois Republican who has split with his party by criticizing former President Donald Trump, tried to make a connection between an old Facebook ad published by Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, and replacement theory. Buffalo massacre further rattles an insecure nation \u201cDid you know:  @EliseStefanik pushes white replacement theory?  The #3 in the house GOP,\u201d Kinzinger said on Twitter, linking to media coverage that the congresswoman\u2019s Facebook ads received in 2021, including a critical editorial from a local newspaper. The Facebook ads from her campaign last September suggested Democrats wanted to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to create a permanent liberal majority in Washington. CNN has reached out to Stefanik about Kinzinger\u2019s comment. Replacement pattern. That ad is part of a larger narrative. Tucker Carlson, the Fox host, has pushed the idea that Democrats want to import new voters to dilute the votes of other Americans, presumably Whites like him. Trump biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio and City University of New York media studies professor James Cohen wrote a CNN opinion piece last year about how the concept of replacement theory has festered in US politics for decades, but has recently become easy to decode in segments on Carlson\u2019s show and in remarks by lawmakers. Read more. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza has documented how the concept of replacement theory has been mentioned by lawmakers like GOP Rep. Scott Perry, who said this at a House Foreign Affairs Committee meeting in April of 2021: \u201cFor many Americans, what seems to be happening or what they believe right now is happening is what appears to them is we\u2019re replacing national-born American \u2014 native-born Americans to permanently transform the landscape of this very nation,\u201d the Pennsylvania Republican said in reference to the number of people trying to enter the country at the United States\u2019 southern border. \u201cUncomfortably\u201d close. This is not to say Perry\u2019s comment, Carlson\u2019s broadcasts or Stefanik\u2019s ad are the same as what\u2019s represented in the writings, allegedly from Gendron or other gunmen. They\u2019re not. But it is also impossible to deny certain parallels in the language. \u201cThis tension, this frustration, this fear sits not that far from our mainstream politics,\u201d journalist Wesley Lowery said on CNN\u2019s Inside Politics Sunday. \u201cOne thing is unquestionably true,\u201d he added. \u201cVery often the rhetoric in our politics sits uncomfortably close to the rhetoric that these kind of terrorists espouse.\u201d Pledges to fight racism. But how? President Joe Biden, who is headed to Buffalo on Tuesday, pledged to fight racism. \u201cAny act of domestic terrorism, including an act perpetrated in the name of a repugnant white nationalist ideology, is antithetical to everything we stand for in America,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cHate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism.\u201d Race is enmeshed in US politics. Political rhetoric often feeds replacement fears by highlighting racial divides that are enmeshed in American life and politics. The issue of immigration will loom over this fall\u2019s midterm elections as Biden struggles with how to end Trump-era immigration policy that has kept US borders largely closed. The related issues of voting rights and election security often pit GOP-led states like Georgia, Texas and Florida against big cities with their large minority populations. Seeking accountability from social media companies. Democratic politicians like New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi argued Sunday that social media companies should bear some responsibility. \u201cThis spreads like a virus,\u201d Hochul told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d She said CEOs of social media companies must look a their policies and do more to take racist content down. \u201cThey have to be able to identify when information like this \u2013 the second it hits the platform, it needs to be taken down, because this is spreading like wildfire.\u201d Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla who has been in the process of buying Twitter, has said he would go in the opposite direction. He\u2019s a self-described free speech absolutist and would allow more, not less, speech online. Buffalo and gun laws. The gun control debate has shown us that even tragic shooting after tragic shooting will lead to very little concrete action so long as a minority of senators, locked together, can stop any legislation New York already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country and Hochul said she would look to close loopholes in state law that she said allowed magazines like the one apparently used in Buffalo across state lines. Separately, Bash asked Pelosi if Democrats should place higher priority on passing gun safety measures like a stricter background check proposal passed by the House that was stalled in the Senate. Pelosi argued the math makes passing such bills a challenge. \u201cThe fact is the 60-vote majority in the Senate is an obstacle to doing any, many good things, unfortunately, and again, we are not going away until the job is done,\u201d Pelosi said.",

Conventional wisdom would say no. But John Fetterman, the tattooed, 6-foot 8-inch, cargo-short-wearing lieutenant governor of the Keystone State is anything but conventional. \u201cWe have to flip this seat,\u201d he told a cheering crowd of over a hundred people packed into the Holy Hound Taproom (\u201cHallowed be thy beer,\u201d the sign says) here in downtown York, where he grew up and where his father\u2019s insurance agency still operates just a few blocks away. Fetterman is the heavy favorite to win Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary ahead of US Rep. Conor Lamb.

Still, the lieutenant governor will face his toughest scrutiny yet if he wins on Tuesday. He\u2019ll have to work harder to energize Black voters, a key part of the Democratic base, after his primary rivals have attacked him for a 2013 incident where he pulled a gun on a person who turned out to be an unarmed black man out jogging.

He insists people call him \u201cJohn\u201d and wears gym shorts and hoodies \u2013 often with the sleeves pushed up to reveal tattoos \u2013 on the campaign trail. His towering physical presence is inescapable. It means that he doesn\u2019t carry himself like a typical politician and the York crowd didn\u2019t treat him like one, either.

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats are struggling to find a path forward to pass a fresh round of Covid-19 aid as they grapple with a difficult choice over whether to allow a vote on a contentious Trump-era pandemic restriction on the border that divides their party and puts vulnerable moderates in a tough spot. The issue has stalled a Covid package for over a month, a delay that has only served to highlight how congressional Democrats have yet to implement a workable plan to break the impasse and enact a key priority for the party even as the Biden administration warns the aid is desperately needed. The bill continues to dog Congress \u2013 even though the White House insisted months ago that $22.5 billion was needed so the US can be prepared for another surge, allowing more Americans to be vaccinated, tested and treated alongside the risk of new variants. Back in March, congressional leaders on both sides cut a $16 billion deal, short of the White House\u2019s ask. But then rank-and-file House Democrats rebelled over the spending cuts Republicans wanted as a condition for their support. Facing the prospect that the Democratic revolt could bring down a government funding plan, a furious Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to drop the Covid aid from the larger plan. Then a bipartisan group of senators reached a $10 billion deal \u2013 dropping money for the global Covid response over disagreements on how to cut spending to offset the costs. But Republicans made clear they wanted a vote on an amendment targeting the Biden administration\u2019s plan to repeal Trump-era pandemic restrictions on the US-Mexico border known as Title 42. Democrats had hoped to avoid a politically fraught dispute over the issue during an election year that risks pitting the White House against Democrats in competitive reelection battles who have raced to distance themselves from the move to repeal the measure. A Title 42 amendment vote could potentially pass the Senate, an outcome that would amount to a major embarrassment to the administration. Democrats have privately expressed frustration at the White House for not providing the party with an alternative to support and provide them with political cover for voting against a Title 42 amendment. It increasingly looks, however, like a vote Senate Democrats may not be able to avoid as pressure mounts on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to allow a vote on the authority to pave the way for passage of Covid aid. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said, \u201cit may be inevitable.\u201d \u201cThere may be a point where to move forward, we have to face this issue on the floor,\u201d said Durbin, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be frightened away from the merits of the issue. We should really consider it part of our job.\u201d Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine indicated he would not have an issue taking the vote, noting that \u201cnone of us who\u2019ve gotten to the US Senate need to be afraid of an amendment vote.\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, agreed, telling CNN on Thursday, \u201cI\u2019m fine with voting on it.\u201d But in a sign of the split within the party over strategy, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, pushed back on Republican efforts to tie the two issues together, calling it a \u201cruse\u201d and telling reporters that \u201cirrelevant amendments and provisions really impede\u201d efforts to pass aid. \u201cAll the arguments trying to tie the two are simply a sham, and ultimately failure to pass this will be a shame,\u201d he added. Schumer has so far refused to cede to GOP demands for a vote targeting the move to lift pandemic restrictions on the border with Mexico, but Republicans believe Schumer will cave. \u201cI think he\u2019s hearing from his members, I know he is,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota. \u201cThey\u2019re just saying, \u2018Let\u2019s just vote on this, and get it over with.\u2019 \u2026 At some point, they will succumb to that.\u201d Senate Republicans blocked an effort in April to take up the $10 billion Covid relief deal over demands on amendments, including one to target the Title 42 decision. Republicans have seized on the issue as they seek to turn immigration into a centerpiece of the upcoming midterm elections. Democrats in competitive reelection battles have attempted to distance themselves from the Title 42 repeal and are bracing for the possibility of a surge of migrants at the border, even as many acknowledge that the pandemic-era rule can\u2019t remain in perpetuity as a way to control the surge at the southern border. The administration has defended the move and says it does have a plan to deal with the expected surge. Officials have said that they have taken a number of steps to prepare for an influx of migrants and beef up security at the border. Schumer did not directly answer when asked at a news conference this week if he would allow a vote on Title 42 to help get Covid aid through, but he did say, \u201cWe will do everything we can to get Covid legislation passed.\u201d \u201cThe House will pursue Covid legislation. They\u2019re first doing Ukraine, then they\u2019re doing Covid. We\u2019ll see what the House sends over. \u2026 When the House passes it, we will do everything we can to get Covid legislation passed.\u201d In the meantime, Democratic leaders have sent mixed signals over the strategy for passing a bill \u2013 and which chamber will take the reins. While Schumer indicated on Tuesday that the House will send a package to the Senate, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on Wednesday that negotiations are continuing in the Senate. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of negotiation going on,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. \u201cI am hopeful that we will move a Covid bill soon. Obviously, negotiations continue in the Senate about getting that done, and what you pay for and what you include.\u201d Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the House Appropriations Committee chairwoman, said, \u201cThat\u2019s all under discussion,\u201d when asked about the timeline for which chamber would act first. \u201cNot determined,\u201d DeLauro said in response to a question about whether the order has been determined. DeLauro said that Title 42 is \u201cpart of the debate and discussion as to whether that\u2019s handled separately or not.\u201d Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, a member of Senate Democratic leadership, also called on Congress to pass Covid aid but dodged when asked about bringing up a vote on Title 42. \u201cThe House is going to decide how they\u2019re going to deal with that. We\u2019ll see what they send over,\u201d she said. Pelosi said at a news conference on Thursday, \u201cWe must pass Covid,\u201d and later said, \u201cI feel confident we will get something done.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer and Annie Grayer contributed.",

            "article_content": "Americans remain broadly opposed to overturning the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, following the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would strike down the landmark ruling. Sixty-six percent say Roe v. Wade should not be completely struck down, and 59% would support Congress passing legislation to establish a nationwide right to abortion, including 81% of Democrats, 65% of independents and 30% of Republicans, the survey finds. But comparing the results of the new poll to one conducted immediately before the revelation of the draft opinion, the impact on the political landscape heading into the 2022 midterms appears fairly muted. What we know about the investigation into the Supreme Court leak The share of registered voters who say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this fall rose 6 points between the first survey and the second, but that increase is about even across party lines. Among Democrats, 43% now say they are extremely or very enthusiastic, up 7 points. Among Republicans, it\u2019s 56%, up 9 points. And voters who say overturning Roe would make them \u201chappy\u201d are nearly twice as enthusiastic about voting this fall as those who say such a ruling would leave them \u201cangry\u201d (38% extremely enthusiastic among those happy, 20% among those angry). The share of Americans who would be angry in the wake of such a ruling (36%) sharply outweighs that who would be happy (17%), and some of the poll\u2019s findings suggest the issue could become a motivating factor for Roe supporters should the draft opinion become the final one. Younger adults are particularly apt to say they would feel angry if Roe were overturned (47% among those younger than 45, compared with 26% among older adults). But younger voters remain far less enthusiastic about casting a ballot this fall \u2013 just 9% of them are extremely enthusiastic about voting this fall vs. 31% of older voters. More broadly, 37% of Americans strongly support Congress establishing a nationwide right to abortion, more than the 28% who strongly oppose such an action. Half (51%) say that if Roe falls, they want their state to become a safe haven for women seeking abortion, compared with 20% who say the procedure should be banned completely in their state. And the share of Americans who say their views on abortion align more with Democrats than Republicans rose 7 points between the two polls (44% with Democrats, 32% with Republicans in the later poll vs. 37% Democrats, 31% Republicans in the earlier one). Republicans hold a narrow edge over Democrats on the generic ballot test, 49% to 42% among registered voters, a slight improvement for Republicans compared with the poll conducted immediately before the ruling. On the economy \u2013 the issue most likely to be a driving factor for voters this fall \u2013 nearly half of adults (46%) in the latest poll say the Republican Party\u2019s positions are more aligned with their own, compared with 31% for the Democratic Party. About three-quarters say that which party controls Congress makes a real difference \u2013 a figure that did not shift between the two polls \u2013 with more Republicans saying so than Democrats (88% vs. 78%). As Roe v. Wade hangs in the balance, Democratic candidates prioritize abortion rights in 2022 Those findings suggest the overall picture for the midterm elections is little changed after this week\u2019s news, at least in the short term. Only about half of the country say they have heard a great deal or a good amount about the draft Supreme Court opinion thus far (49%), with 51% saying they\u2019ve heard just some or nothing at all about it. The poll conducted after the draft ruling became public also finds a small increase since January in the share of Americans who say they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on abortion; that view increased more among Republicans (from 15% in January to 26% now) than among Democrats (24% in January to 29% now). On this measure, though, the ideological divide tells a different story, with liberals\u2019 commitment to a candidate who shares their views on abortion rising 12 points; among conservatives, it\u2019s up 6 points. Should Roe fall, most now say they would like their own state to set abortion laws that are more permissive toward abortion (58%) than restrictive (42%). Those percentages are similar to the results of a CNN poll conducted in January, though about half (52%) think abortions would become at least somewhat harder to get where they live if Roe were overturned. There is a larger share in the new poll compared with January, though, who say that if Roe is struck down, they do not think that abortion would become harder to get where they live (25% now vs. 14% in January). That shift is driven mostly by men: 35% say so now vs. 19% in January. Among women, 16% say so now vs. 10% in January. In considering the impact that a ruling like the draft opinion might have on other laws resting on privacy rights, Americans are more likely to see a couple\u2019s right to marry regardless of their gender as under threat (38% see it as threatened, 35% as secure) than they are to say the same of a woman\u2019s right to use contraception (23% threatened, 63% secure) or a couple\u2019s right to marry regardless of race or ethnicity (19% threatened, 66% secure). Democrats see more of a threat across the board, including 57% who say same-sex marriage is threatened vs. 21% among Republicans. Overall, nearly two-thirds (63%) say the Supreme Court ought to consider public opinion in making its decisions.   There are particularly sharp divisions by age over abortion, and the strong backing for abortion rights among younger adults suggests an opening Democrats could use to boost their standing with this group, whose support of President Joe Biden has waned. Among those younger than 45, 75% oppose overturning Roe and 68% support Congress establishing a nationwide abortion right, compared with 58% opposed to overturning Roe and 51% in favor of congressional action to codify abortion rights among those older than 45. And 30% of younger people say they would only vote for a candidate who shares their views on the issue vs. 23% among older people. In the earlier poll, perceptions of each party\u2019s alignment with the mainstream are about equal. Roughly half of the public, 52%, say they see the views and policies of the Democratic Party as generally mainstream rather than too extreme, with 54% saying the same of the Republican Party. Partisans are generally comfortable with their own party: 90% of Republicans see the GOP as mainstream, and an identical 90% of Democrats consider their party to be mainstream. Just 13% of Americans view both parties as too extreme. While Republicans are better aligned with Americans\u2019 views on the economy and Democrats on abortion, the two polls show that several other issues are more closely divided. Americans are split on which party shares more of their views on voting rights and election integrity (41% say Democrats, 38% Republicans), helping the middle class (35% Democrats, 32% Republicans), education (35% Democrats, 34% Republicans) and the United States\u2019 role in world affairs (35% say Republicans, 30% Democrats). The GOP has a significant lead on immigration (42% to 34%) and crime and policing (43% to 28%), while Democrats do on women\u2019s rights (45% to 29%). Other than abortion, Americans\u2019 party preferences changed little on the issues that were tested in both surveys. The two CNN polls were conducted by SSRS online and by phone, with both samples drawn from a probability-based panel. One survey was conducted from April 28-May 1 among a random national sample of 1,007 adults. Results for the full sample of that poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. The second was conducted from May 3-5 among a random national sample of 800 adults. It has an error margin of plus or minus 4.5 points. The headline of this story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Billionaire tech mogul Peter Thiel won big when his longtime friend J.D. Vance succeeded in Tuesday\u2019s Ohio Senate GOP primary, surging to victory in the final days of the race after a last-minute endorsement from former President Donald Trump and a seven-figure boost from Thiel. But as the 2022 midterm cycle heats up, Thiel is winding down, according to two people familiar with the matter. \u201cHe\u2019s done for the cycle. He\u2019s not putting any more money into any more races or getting involved in new races,\u201d said one person familiar with Thiel\u2019s plans who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Thiel, who has contributed more than $25 million this cycle, has been satisfied with the returns on his investments so far, said a second person familiar with the matter. Vance is heading to a general election. Arizona Senate Republican hopeful Blake Masters, who co-authored Thiel\u2019s 2014 book \u201cZero to One\u201d and who has also been bankrolled by the tech leader in his race, appears poised to receive a Trump endorsement ahead of his state\u2019s August primary. And two congressional challengers whom Thiel has also supported \u2013 Joe Kent in Washington and Harriet Hageman in Wyoming \u2013 have mounted competitive bids against incumbent Republicans who voted to impeach former President Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think the level of support that he\u2019s given Blake and J.D. is going to be at all reflective of that activity in the future,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the matter. A Thiel representative did not immediately return a request for comment. Of the eye-popping sum Thiel has spent so far this cycle, more than $20 million went to super PACs supporting Vance and Masters, both of whom have embraced Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election and are patrons of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. \u201cI think people are underestimating how much his personal friendship with these guys has to do with his activity and level of involvement,\u201d this person said. Of course, the tech tycoon could still reverse course. A Trump endorsement and primary win for Masters could be a rousing scenario that lures Thiel back into the game if he feels he can have a significant impact elsewhere, as could a situation in which Masters or Vance find themselves struggling in general election contests. Either way, the entrepreneur-turned-populist firebrand has demonstrated his potential as one of the most powerful forces in Republican politics and an influential advocate for the strain of Trump-style populism that guides the candidates he is backing. People close to both Thiel and Trump expect the billionaire tech investor to remain quietly involved in the political arena even if his financial contributions slow down, citing his proximity to the former President and the likelihood that he would serve as an informal adviser to Masters and Vance should one or both make it to the Senate. Trump and Thiel have huddled at least three times in the last year at the former President\u2019s properties in New York, Bedminster and Palm Beach, according to people familiar with these meetings. And though they are not as close as some might imagine, the two men have quite a bit of crossover between their aides and advisers. Former White House director of presidential personnel Johnny McEntee, for example, reportedly secured funding from Thiel for a dating app he created and regularly speaks to both men, while other informal Trump advisers were deeply involved in working to elect Vance. \u201cThey are friendly, but it\u2019s not like Peter\u2019s in his inner circle,\u201d a former Trump campaign official said. \u201cHe [Thiel] has certainly stepped out more because he feels aligned with Trump and that has made him feel more comfortable in his skin than anything else,\u201d said another former Trump aide. So far, Thiel appears to prefer operating far more behind the scenes than Trump. Throughout the Ohio primary, for instance, he made no effort to dictate how the money he gave to Protect Ohio Values, a super PAC supporting Vance, should be spent \u2013 instead entrusting those in charge of the group to spend the nearly $15 million he contributed in whatever ways they saw fit. Luke Thompson, the executive director of the super PAC, told CNN he has had virtually no interaction with the billionaire benefactor. Given his personal friendship with Vance, Thompson said, Thiel communicated his advice and thoughts directly to the campaign, not Protect Ohio. But what the super PAC did in public, Thompson said, informed the campaign\u2019s moves in a way that placed Vance in the best position to get Trump\u2019s endorsement \u2013 and, subsequently, the nomination. One 30-second ad that first aired in March began with a voiceover declaring that for Vance, \u201cborder security is personal\u201d and ended with a reminder that the candidate has a \u201cpersonal mission to secure the border.\u201d In between, the ad touts Vance\u2019s Trump-like promises to \u201cfinish the wall\u201d and \u201cend welfare for illegals\u201d with an even more Trumpian declaration that \u201celites and establishment politicians have failed us.\u201d \u201cAt that point, we sort of passed the baton to the campaign,\u201d Thompson said. Just a few weeks later and right as early voting began on April 5, Vance\u2019s campaign released its first TV ad that hit the exact same message on immigration, with one important distinction: Vance himself appeared in the spot, speaking directly to the camera. After mockingly asking if Republican voters are \u201cracist\u201d and listing off the problems with illegal drugs and \u201cDemocrat voters\u201d coming into the country over the border, Vance pauses and looks down. \u201cThis issue is personal,\u201d he says. \u201cI nearly lost my mother to the poison coming across our border. No child should grow up an orphan.\u201d That ad, Thompson said, made a bigger impression with voters in focus groups than any of the primary debates. It also delivered enough of a momentum boost for Vance in the polls at the right time to appeal to Trump \u2013 at a time when the other Ohio Republican campaigns seemed to have run out of ways to close the deal down at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cWe had him [Vance] tied for first with Gibbons and Mandel going into early voting,\u201d Thompson said. With the new ad and then the Trump endorsement, \u201che had exit velocity.\u201d Inside Trump\u2019s orbit, the former President\u2019s allies expect Vance\u2019s come-from-behind victory to result in an endorsement of Masters in the near future. Thiel didn\u2019t convince Trump to endorse Vance, but after the Ohioan\u2019s victory on Tuesday, the former President now believes that the tech mogul has a knack for picking \u201cwinners,\u201d according to a person close to Trump. \u201cI think a Masters endorsement was already happening but J.D.\u2019s win makes it even more likely,\u201d said the former Trump campaign official, noting that Trump stepped out of a wedding at Mar-a-Lago last Saturday to call into a Masters campaign event. \u201cI just want to thank you all, you\u2019re an incredible group. I heard Blake was the person that showed up and I want to thank Blake,\u201d Trump said over the phone to the campaign event\u2019s audience, who had gathered to hear about so-called election integrity in Arizona. Trump has already endorsed both Kent and Hageman, who have received contributions from Thiel toward their races. Thiel himself also hosted a fundraiser for Hageman, the Wyoming GOP hopeful who is looking to unseat Rep. Liz Cheney, at his Miami Beach mansion earlier this year that featured Donald Trump Jr. as a guest. At that event, Thiel reportedly told guests he is eager to unseat \u201cthe traitorous 10\u201d House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 (four of whom have since announced their plans to retire). But as Thiel has voiced support for helping to rid the GOP of its non-Trumpian members, his actual involvement so far \u2013 large contributions to only two candidates and smaller donations to a handful of others \u2013 tells a different story. Some Trump allies said they will be closely watching Thiel\u2019s next moves before they get too excited about the prospect of him emerging as a consistent mega-donor on the right. \u201cI think a lot of people assume [Thiel] is going to be the next Sheldon Adelson or whatever. I\u2019m not so sure of that yet,\u201d said one person close to Trump.",

            "article_content": "Most White Houses wait for their midterm election shellacking or thumping to shake up their message and strategy shop. It\u2019s a mark of the daunting political environment, beset by high inflation, foreign wars and the worst public health disaster in 100 years, that Joe Biden is starting the process now. The President, who ran in 2020 as a prophet of national unity, and spent the first year of his administration reaching across the aisle \u2013 a process that yielded a rare bipartisan infrastructure law \u2013 is done turning down America\u2019s political inferno. In recent days, Biden has switched on a rhetorical blowtorch and blasted Republicans as followers of ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d demagoguery. And after a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion suggested the greatest liberal defeat of the modern era is looming \u2013 the abolition of the constitutional right to an abortion \u2013 Biden questioned which basic rights the right-wing high court majority fashioned by Trump will strip next. Biden and his advisers hope that if anything can change their midterm fortunes, it's a fight over Roe The President, meanwhile, on Thursday named a new White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre. Biden\u2019s new top spokesperson will replace Jen Psaki, who is reportedly heading for a TV job with MSNBC. Psaki has been one of the undoubted media stars of the administration. But her departure means a fresh face at the podium and a statement of history that will likely please the Democratic base since Jean-Pierre, currently Psaki\u2019s deputy, will be the first Black and out LGBTQ person to do the job. Jean-Pierre\u2019s family includes her partner, CNN national correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, and their daughter. Biden is also bringing Anita Dunn, an outside adviser and one of the most respected Democratic consultants and communications experts, into the West Wing full time, CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Kaitlan Collins reported. Dunn will be expected to sharpen Biden\u2019s messaging tactics going into the midterm election in November. And she will be in place to try to chart the President\u2019s early 2024 campaign and rebuild his image if Republicans take over Capitol Hill and subject the White House to the agony of constant investigation. In sharpening his midterm message and his assault on Trumpism, the President is doing exactly what party leaders must going into elections \u2013 offer their candidates a rationale for power and a counter to their opponents\u2019 attacks. But changes of message and personnel only go so far. The midterms are becoming a referendum on Biden himself after an administration that started strongly but began to sink under the most unprecedented slate of crises to face any President of the modern age. CNN Poll: Most Americans say now is not the time to end Trump-era Title 42 border policy Events on Thursday alone underscored just how difficult it will be for a President, whose approval ratings have dipped to 41% in the latest CNN poll, to revive a term that had majority support less than a year ago. It was a brutal day on Wall Street, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed more than 1,000 points, reversing a rebound the day before as the market struggles to make up its mind on the Federal Reserve\u2019s strategy to fight soaring inflation, which is the crisis that appears to be hurting the administration the most. As Biden leads the West in an effective proxy war with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine triggered the biggest military conflagration in Europe since World War II, a new foreign policy crisis is emerging that could again test his authority. CNN\u2019s Barbara Starr reported that North Korea may be preparing its first underground nuclear test in nearly five years. The detonation could come as early as this month, three sources said. It would not be a surprise if Kim Jong Un, bristling that the US President is refusing to replicate Trump\u2019s vanity summits, scheduled the blast for around Biden\u2019s upcoming trip to South Korea. Such a scenario would give Republicans another data point for their misleading, but still potentially effective campaign trope that US enemies see Biden as weak. In more bad news for the administration on Thursday, a CNN poll showed that only 26% of Americans are at least somewhat confident the administration is prepared to handle any increase in the number of migrants seeking to enter the US that might result from the ending of Title 42 \u2013 a pandemic-era border restriction that the administration had hoped to phase out this month. The administration\u2019s plans were temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Louisiana. Border policy fight puts vulnerable Democrats at odds with Biden administration Immigration has emerged as a huge political weakness for the White House heading into the midterms. The issue leaves it exposed to Republicans exaggerating the border crisis on the right and liberals who complain that Biden has not done enough to lift hardline Trump restrictions. And Democrats under threat in November are frustrated that the administration has prevaricated on border issues. Even Sen. Maggie Hassan, whose home state of New Hampshire is thousands of miles from the southern border but who is likely facing a tough reelection, said in a recent video from a section of wall in Arizona that she would push the White House to keep Title 42 in place until it had a plan to secure the border. Moderate Democrats are also expressing frustration at the administration\u2019s failure to do more to control inflation \u2013 as prices of basic goods and gasoline surge \u2013 even if outside factors, like the war in Ukraine and supply chain clogs brought on by Covid-19 lockdowns in Asian manufacturing hubs, are mostly to blame. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied because, you know, prices for Arizonans are still too high. They need to work on it,\u201d Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju Thursday. The first-term Democrat is among the most endangered incumbents in the fall. Jared Bernstein, a member of Biden\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Thursday that people need to be \u201cnuanced\u201d when they assess an economy that features both the highest cost of living in 40 years and a near 50-year low unemployment rate. But nuance is the first casualty of political campaigns, and Republicans have an easy opening given high prices to claim Biden has wrecked the economy. A feeling of economic doom is going around. And there isn't much we can do other than sit back and watch The President\u2019s toughened tone went up a notch when he appeared in the White House on Wednesday to claim credit for slashing the federal deficit \u2013 an achievement to be sure, but one that might not placate voters hit by high gas prices. Biden singled out a plan put forward by Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who heads the GOP\u2019s Senate campaign committee, that the President said would raise taxes and put cherished entitlements like Social Security and Medicare at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s a MAGA agenda all right. Let me tell you about this ultra-MAGA agenda \u2013 it\u2019s extreme, as most MAGA things are,\u201d Biden said, riffing off Trump\u2019s signature slogan. \u201cUnder this new plan, this tax plan, the ultra-MAGA agenda, while big corporations and billionaires are going to pay nothing more, the working class folks will pay a hell of a lot more,\u201d Biden said. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, who knows a vote-loser when he sees one, has rebuked Scott\u2019s plan. But if Republicans won\u2019t play the nuance game in their messaging, Biden won\u2019t either. The President also lashed out at the conservative majority on the Supreme Court after Politico published a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito that suggested the top bench is poised to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Biden argued that by rejecting Roe\u2019s finding that a right to privacy existed in the Constitution, the court could target all other basic rights that many Americans may take for granted. \u201cThis is about a lot more than abortion,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhat are the next things that are going to be attacked? Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that\u2019s existed in American history, in recent American history,\u201d he said. Biden\u2019s invoking of Trumpism may not be coincidental since the ex-President\u2019s enduring influence in the Republican Party is reflected in the spectacle of GOP primary candidates battling for his endorsement. And after all, Biden did handily beat Trump in 2020, fair and square, whatever the defeated, twice-impeached, one-term former President says. Still, rooting a midterm election campaign on the idea that all Republicans share Trump\u2019s extremist, anti-democratic tendencies is a risk. Such a strategy failed for Democrats last year, when Virginia\u2019s Glenn Youngkin captured the governor\u2019s mansion. The Republican pioneered a campaign targeting rising prices and concern among parents over education after a year of pandemic lockdowns and conservative complaints about how schools dealt with race and transgender issues. For all his visibility, Trump isn\u2019t on the ballot this year and voters are squarely focused on the economy. But given Democrats\u2019 uphill midterm battle, a White House message that targets MAGA-world extremism and seeks to capitalize on threats to abortion rights may be Biden\u2019s only bet.",

The seismic revelation that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court appears ready to overturn nearly a half century-long constitutional right to an abortion sent a shock through a yet-to-be defined midterm election campaign. Such a decision \u2013 if a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito published by Politico on Monday holds through a final vote on the court \u2013 would initiate stunning legal and societal changes in the United States. It could give Democrats, who could be headed for heavy losses in November, an issue with which to galvanize activist voters and potentially counter some Republicans targeting high inflation and cultural issues in the suburbs. Of course, the implications of this story stretch far beyond Washington, partisan politics and dueling interpretations of the law, the nature of precedent and the Constitution. Abortion rights on the brink: Catch up on the developments Losing access to abortion would mean millions of women would be deprived of the right to make decisions about their own bodies \u2013 even if their health or very lives are at risk. The burden for this huge erosion of women\u2019s rights is likely to fall heavily on poorer, minority women who already have worse health outcomes and access. Conversely, the overturning of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision would also be the story of generations of conservative activists, who mounted a sincere moral mission to end what they see as an inhumane procedure that they think is antithetical to America\u2019s founding values. Yet for all its human dimensions, the issue of abortion is an inherently political question. After all, if the court overturns Roe v. Wade, it would be the culmination of successive Republican political campaigns that produced a conservative majority on the court. And it would further widen the growing cultural, legal and political gulf between Republican-led states, where abortion would likely be banned, and Democratic-run bastions where legislators will likely keep it legal. The challenge now for Democrats \u2013 in the run-up to the midterm elections in November and potentially for years to come \u2013 is whether they can build a similarly effective campaign on abortion as Republicans have. For decades, Republicans up and down the ballot have emphasized calls to abolish abortion and the need to create majorities in Washington to build a Supreme Court hostile to abortion rights. While Democrats have used the issue to activate their base and raise money \u2013 see the influence of EMILY\u2019s List, which backs pro-abortion rights female candidates, for example \u2013 that same single-minded concentration on this core issue was never as pronounced at Democratic presidential, congressional and local events. That difference may reflect the revolutionary zeal of conservatives mobilizing to overturn a status quo and the complacency of liberals who had lived with it for most of their lives. One anti-abortion activist, Mallory Carroll, who serves as vice president of communications at Susan B. Anthony List, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Tuesday that the issue always motivated the right more than the left. Alito's draft opinion to reverse Roe is everything the anti-abortion movement has worked for \u201cHistorically, the intensity gap has favored pro-life candidates,\u201d Carroll said, but she added that she believed the issue would motivate voters from both sides in November. That same realization pulsated through Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s comments on Tuesday outside the Supreme Court. \u201cThe Republicans have been working toward this day for decades,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been out there plotting, carefully cultivating these Supreme Court justices so they can have a majority of the bench who would accomplish something that the majority of Americans do not want.\u201d It\u2019s fair to question a political system that saw then-President Donald Trump, who failed to win a popular vote majority, nominate the three justices who cemented the conservative dominance of the bench. And there are even firmer grounds to bring up then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s hypocritical maneuverings that produced that edge. But for the most part, Republicans worked through valid political structures to reach the Rubicon that the Supreme Court seems about to cross. And Democrats lacked the ruthlessness to match their passion for this single goal. Much has been made of polls that show that Americans overwhelmingly oppose overturning Roe v. Wade since the Alito draft emerged on Monday night. A CNN poll in January, for instance, showed 69% would oppose such a decision. Biden's political and personal evolution on abortion on display after publication of draft Supreme Court opinion But the question for Democrats is: can they get people to vote on it? Former Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis thinks they will, after seeing pro-abortion rights rallies spring up around the country on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s just the beginning of what I think is going to be an important tipping point in the 2022 election cycle,\u201d the Democrat said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAC360.\u201d For her view to be borne out, Democrats \u2013 from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris down to local candidates \u2013 will have to show a political intensity and relentless message discipline that has so far eluded them in a tumultuous time. Harris gave a passionate speech on the issue at Tuesday\u2019s EMILY\u2019s List gala, saying, \u201cHow dare (Republican leaders) tell a woman what she can do and cannot do with her own body?\u201d But there is no guarantee a singular focus on abortion will mitigate stiff headwinds Democrats are facing on issues like high gasoline prices and inflation. On the face of it, Democrats suddenly have one answer to a problem they\u2019ve been facing for weeks: What is their message in a midterm election campaign weighed down by an unpopular President and an apparent inability to answer voter concerns over high inflation, immigration and crime? In theory, it should be simple for them to knit together the looming abortion ruling with claims that Republicans \u2013 some of whom are embracing hardline campaigns against transgender rights and demagoguing discussions of race in education \u2013 have raced to radical extremes. A message stressing the need to save abortion rights \u2013 or punishing Republicans for overturning them \u2013 might also be a way to shore up support among suburban female voters who were critical to Democrats winning the House in 2018 and Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. Democrats turn focus to abortion after months of midterm message uncertainty The issue could offer an opening in Republican-run states where large numbers of Democratic women face losing their constitutional right to an abortion. Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke clearly thinks so. He announced a rally for abortion rights in Houston on Saturday, and cut a video that showed every sign of putting the issue at the center of his long-shot campaign to unseat Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. \u201cWe are going to organize, we are going to rally, and we are going to fight for the rights of our fellow Texans, especially the right to an abortion that is under attack in this state unlike any other place in the country,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. Abortion is an issue that will emphasize one of the emerging characteristics of Texas politics \u2013 the schism between Republicans, who dominate state power and draw on the state\u2019s vast heartland, and cities like Houston where most Democratic voters live. That\u2019s a divide mirrored across the country. Democrats who have raised concerns about the intensity of their base enthusiasm also hope to use the issue to skewer Republicans in swing states like Wisconsin. As the Politico story reverberated, Sen. Ron Johnson, who\u2019s the most vulnerable Republican incumbent senator this year, was already trying to shift the conversation back to topics that have put Democrats on the defensive. \u201cYou take a look at open borders, 40-year high inflation, record gas prices, rising crime,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey can\u2019t talk about the results of their governance, so they\u2019ve got to try and find something else to run on.\u201d Conservatives ought to have been celebrating on Tuesday at the prospect that a longed-for political victory was in reach. But many were oddly reticent, reflecting the uncertain political impact of this lightning bolt. Many chose to concentrate on the release of the draft opinion \u2013 a hugely unusual breach of Supreme Court security \u2013 demanding a leak inquiry and stiff punishments for the culprit. \u201cYou need, it seems to me to \u2013 excuse the lecture \u2013 to concentrate on what the news is today. Not a leaked draft, but the fact that the draft was leaked,\u201d McConnell, now the Senate minority leader, told reporters. What we know about the investigation into the Supreme Court leak Another member of the Senate Republican leadership, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, also seemed reticent to weigh in on the impact the Alito draft opinion \u2013 and an eventual final Supreme Court decision \u2013 could have on the midterms. \u201cI don\u2019t know it\u2019s necessarily a party issue,\u201d Thune told CNN. \u201cI think it\u2019s more of an issue of conscience.\u201d Republicans\u2019 caution may reflect concern that the political furor could cause some conservative justices to water down their position and threaten a victory on Roe v. Wade. But it also shows how a campaign shaping up inexorably in the GOP\u2019s favor now suddenly has an unpredictable element. And Democrats think they have an opening. \u201cThey\u2019re like the dog that caught the bus,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \u201cThey know they\u2019re on the wrong side of history. They know they\u2019re on the wrong side of where the American people are.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers, Manu Raju, Melanie Zanona, Morgan Rimmer and Ryan Nobles contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "The US Supreme Court\u2019s legitimacy has been deeply pierced, and it may never recover its stature in the eyes of America. For Chief Justice John Roberts, whose concern for the institution\u2019s reputation is manifest in nearly every opinion he writes and every public speech he makes, the developments are a disaster of the highest order. Not only does it appear that the five most conservative members of the court, including the three new appointees of former President Donald Trump, are ready to overturn a half century of constitutionally grounded abortion rights. It further appears that Politico, which published the first draft of the opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, had surmounted the court\u2019s longstanding protocols of secrecy and security. Collins calls draft Roe opinion 'completely inconsistent' with what Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said during hearings and meetings Such a breach of an opinion at this early stage of drafting is unprecedented. And that it occurred in a case of seismic importance to American life, a case that could affect so many women and their families, and in a case that could reorder the political landscape, only makes the entire episode more startling. The extraordinary episode is likely to sow distrust among the justices and could affect negotiations on other pending cases set to be resolved by late June. Also awaiting decisions are controversies over gun control, religious rights and Biden administration immigration policy. The chief justice called it a \u201cbetrayal\u201d and said the Marshal of the Court will investigate. \u201cThis was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here,\u201d Roberts said in a statement. The court\u2019s integrity was already on shaky ground, with its public approval rating in record decline. The conservative supermajority on the nine-member bench, along with a lack of transparency regarding potential conflicts of interest and some of the court\u2019s substantive business, has been fueling congressional proposals for change at the high court. Those range from a formal ethics code for the justices to, dramatically, an expansion of the number of seats to offset the far-right dominance. Within the court itself, recent sessions have been marked by finger-pointing and recriminations among justices. Liberals and conservatives have questioned each other\u2019s motives in cases, and the six justices on the right have sometimes bitterly splintered. Roberts, who before October 2020 was in control as the justice at the ideological middle, has increasingly faced derision by fellow conservatives and been relegated to solo opinions. The new breach of court secrecy may initially cause the justices to close ranks, as they often do in the face of external scrutiny and criticism. But it could more seriously undermine trust among the nine as a blame game begins. Abortion rights in America date to 1973, when the high court by a 7-2 vote declared that a constitutional right to privacy, rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment, covered a woman\u2019s right to end a pregnancy. The justices solidly reaffirmed that core right in 1992, reinforcing the principle that states could not interfere with a woman\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion before a fetus could survive out the womb, at about 23 weeks Even justices who had criticized Roe said it was important to adhere to the precedent, for institutional reasons and because, quite simply, Americans had come to rely on it. Polls continue to show that a majority of Americans oppose reversing Roe v. Wade. 'Almost contemptuous': Reporter who broke SCOTUS story on draft opinion language The current court, however, has been moving in the opposite direction. Trump, who campaigned against Roe, was able to appoint three right-wing justices in succession. The first in 2017, Neil Gorsuch, gained a seat because Senate Republicans had in 2016 blocked any action on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s choice of then-US appellate Judge Merrick Garland. Trump pushed through Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, and then in late 2020, after the death of staunch liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, he successfully won Senate confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett just days before the November presidential election. Their appointments, along with conservative veteran Justice Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, suggested it was inevitable the new court would limit reproductive rights. The rightward force on multiple legal issues also caused Roberts, who had opposed abortion rights, to hedge. He increasingly showed concern that the bench might be lurching too far to the right, and he found himself siding more and more with what remains of the liberal wing, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The Supreme Court may have just fundamentally altered the 2022 election Before the Monday night bombshell, sources had told CNN that Roberts had been opposed to overturning Roe completely and had looked toward a possible compromise that would uphold the disputed Mississippi law that limits abortions at 15 weeks \u2013 but leave parts of Roe intact. Sources said that Roberts had \u2013 so far \u2013 failed to make headway with the newest justices, Kavanaugh and Barrett, two who have shown some tentativeness compared to their brethren on the right wing. It is difficult to know what other drafts opinions may have circulated among the justices or how firm the positions of some justices were since the Mississippi case was argued on December 1. There are possibly several more weeks of negotiations before the traditional summer recess for the bench. But the disclosure of the draft opinion in such a chaotic fashion could disrupt any further efforts by Roberts. Abortion cases have historically taken multiple twists and turns behind the scenes. In the 1992 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey case, it was late May when then-Justice Anthony Kennedy dropped a note to Justice Harry Blackmun to tell him developments would please Blackmun, the author of Roe. Why John Roberts cited the private papers of the justice who wrote Roe v. Wade It was just one month before the June 29 opinion was released that Kennedy wrote to Blackmun: \u201cI need to see you as soon as you have a few free moments. I want to tell you about some developments in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and at least part of what I say should come as welcome news.\u201d In that 1992 case, Kennedy and fellow GOP appointees Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and David Souter wrote a joint opinion that affirmed the essential holding of Roe, even with some ambivalence. The trio asserted: \u201cMen and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\u201d Perhaps anticipating this moment, Kagan has been pounding away in opinions and in comments from the bench about the importance of adhering to precedent.   When the court sticks to its landmarks, even those that some people oppose, Kagan asserted during arguments in an April case unrelated to abortion, it can enhance \u201cthe legitimacy of the court and the way the court operates\u201d and speak in a \u201cprofound sense about the court as an institution and the role it plays in society.\u201d Reversal of a landmark, she suggested, \u201cwould have a kind of unsettling effect,\u201d not only on people\u2019s understanding of the relevant area of the law involved, \u201cbut on people\u2019s understanding of the court itself.\u201d In his apparent first draft dated February 10, Alito brushed off the court\u2019s usual adherence to precedent, writing that Roe v. Wade does not does not deserve such regard. \u201cRoe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\u201d Insisted Alito: \u201cAnd far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hoping to push himself over the edge with Republican voters in the final hours of the Ohio Senate GOP primary contest, J.D. Vance arrived at a town hall outside of Columbus on Monday with two populist icons who were familiar faces to many in the crowd: Sen. Josh Hawley and conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. In the final days of his campaign, the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author has pulled out all the stops, from traversing the state with high-profile surrogates, calling in favors from former President Donald Trump, and flooding the airwaves with his final campaign ads. But there were still plenty of undecided voters at his second stop of the day. Some came with questions they were hoping to get answered. Still hung up on the insults Vance hurled at Trump and his supporters during the 2016 presidential cycle, they wanted to see for themselves if his new alliance with the former President seemed genuine \u2013 something Trump himself insisted on during a telephone rally later Monday evening. Others arrived with truly open ears. Not yet sold on a candidate, they came to learn more about Trump\u2019s man in the race and why he awarded his coveted endorsement last month to a political newcomer like Vance. Among them was Janet Schirtzinger, who was planning to vote for Vance in Tuesday\u2019s primary until she saw an ad over the weekend highlighting his ties to Silicon Valley. Vance launched venture capital firm Narya in 2020 with financial support from tech billionaire and Paypal cofounder Peter Thiel and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. \u201cI saw some stuff yesterday that bothered me. I liked him before I heard that and I like Hawley and Charlie Kirk, so I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see if he takes questions,\u201d said Schirtzinger, noting that she is also considering rival candidate and Ohio state senator Matt Dolan. 'The economics of everything': Ohio voters say inflation is their top concern Dolan has stood out as the only Trump-friendly candidate in the race who didn\u2019t actively seek the former President\u2019s stamp of approval like Vance, former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel, businessman Mike Gibbons and former Ohio GOP chairwoman Jane Timken. The soft-spoken state senator insisted on Monday that his distance from Trump was neither deliberate nor reflective of how he views Trump. \u201cI didn\u2019t pick a lane. I\u2019m being myself,\u201d he told reporters as he knocked on doors around Grove City on Monday afternoon, noting that he believes Trump \u201cwas a good Republican president.\u201d \u201cWe know there is momentum behind us because we feel it at the doors we\u2019re knocking on today. We feel it on the phone. We feel it at our rallies that we\u2019re having,\u201d Dolan later told CNN. Deliberate or not, his approach may be paying off in the final days of the Senate primary. A Fox poll released last week showed Dolan, who has contributed $10.6 million of his own fortune to his campaign, and Vance as the only Republican candidates who had gained significant ground in the race since March. \u201cYou have a lot of candidates who are splitting the Trump vote and that seems to be paying dividends for Matt Dolan,\u201d said Matt Dole, a GOP strategist based in Columbus who described the Ohio Senate primary as one of the most unpredictable contests he\u2019s ever seen in his state. \u201cI can\u2019t think of another primary at this level where it could still go so many different ways this late in the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s perplexing that we still haven\u2019t seen voters coalesce behind one candidate yet.\u201d Speaking to a modest crowd at a golf club outside of Columbus during the lunch hour on Monday, Vance took every opportunity to remind his audience that he had received Trump\u2019s support and was committed to the former President\u2019s agenda. The conservative author focused heavily on two issues that were raised by several voters in the crowd as top-of-mind: stopping the flow of illicit drugs into the US and fixing the current immigration system. \u201cI like that he isn\u2019t a politician and is a young man,\u201d said Phyllis Drakulich, who was invited to the town hall by her grandson \u2013 a big Vance fan. As he echoed Trump throughout his stump speech, Vance still found skeptics in the crowd. At one point, Vance was interrupted by longtime Republican voter Kristen Lewis, who asked why he had criticized Trump before changing his tune as a Senate candidate to support the 45th President. Lewis told CNN she was offended and infuriated by Vance\u2019s remarks, which have been amplified in TV ads by Vance\u2019s opponents for months in Ohio. As a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d Vance openly mused about supporting then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. He ultimately voted for independent candidate Evan McMullin. \u201cI wish he\u2019d just tell the truth. I don\u2019t know why he said that,\u201d Lewis said as she left the lunchtime event. \u201cI did not vote for Trump the first time around, but I guess if Trump can forgive what he said, for the betterment of America, I have to trust somebody.\u201d Ohio GOP Senate primary poses a key test of Trump's influence After the event, Vance told reporters that he regretted his past criticism of Trump, describing it as \u201ca mistake because I was wrong.\u201d Vance met with Trump repeatedly before earning his endorsement in late April and made similar comments at a rally with the former President in Delaware County last month. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to change your mind. In fact, you should change your mind when the facts change and I think that\u2019s the truth about my view of President Trump,\u201d he said Monday. Trump, for his part, said in the telephone rally for Vance Monday, \u201cHe said some negative things about me, but he\u2019s made up for it in spades.\u201d \u201cI think I can say he\u2019s 1000% with us. But everyone else has said negative things also. If I went by that, I\u2019d never be able to endorse anybody,\u201d the former President said. Ultimately, Lewis said she planned to reluctantly support Vance after hearing from Hawley and Kirk, who took turns vouching for the candidate\u2019s MAGA bona fides at his campaign stops on Monday. Hawley, the Republican senator from Missouri, said the fierce backlash to Vance\u2019s campaign among the GOP establishment was a testament to his ability to disrupt the status quo. For others, the hour-long event failed to sway them one way or another. \u201cHe said people who voted for Trump did so for racist reasons. I hope he addresses that today,\u201d said Kirk Allton of Columbus, who attended the afternoon town hall with his wife. Allton told CNN after the event that he was still on the fence and planned to do additional research before choosing a candidate on Tuesday. For Trump, Tuesday presents the biggest test yet of his strength as a Republican powerbroker. If Vance wins, the former President will begin a critical stretch of primaries with one victory under his belt and possible momentum behind some of the other candidates he\u2019s endorsed. If he loses, it could threaten Trump\u2019s kingmaker status and cause voters in other states to potentially rethink who they will support in other contests this month. For these reasons, the former President has invested heavily in helping to push Vance over the finish line, including taping robocalls and videos for the conservative author in addition to the last-minute tele-town hall Monday with thousands of Ohio voters, according to a person familiar with the matter. This person said the former President is \u201cfeeling good\u201d about Vance\u2019s shot at winning the nomination. May primaries set to test Trump's touch as GOP kingmaker \u201cJD Vance has a little bit of an advantage being the author of a bestselling book about his background, which built his personality long before he got into this race,\u201d said Dole, the GOP strategist, who believes the primary will ultimately be decided by how voters end up evaluating each candidate\u2019s personality. \u201cWe have self-funders running essentially across the board and that has changed the dynamic by moving this past a contest of name ID being the primary indicator of who is going to win to people wanting to get to know the candidates personally,\u201d Dole said. Whoever emerges as the winner on Tuesday is likely to face off in November against Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan in November, who Trump and others have privately and publicly described as a potentially tough competitor. Asked on Monday if he believes the general election will be tough for the eventual Republican nominee, Dolan responded immediately. \u201cI do. I do,\u201d he said. This story has been updated with comments from former President Donald Trump. CNN\u2019s Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden\u2019s term has become a punchline \u2013 even to the President. Biden might have been a good sport in poking fun at himself, his dented approval ratings and his failure to fully enact his domestic agenda at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association annual gala dinner on Saturday night. But his jokes were rooted in the painful reality of a presidency hostage to economic and global forces beyond his control and compounded by some of the tactical errors of his White House. The result is that a year after his approval rating was comfortably over 50%, the President and his party are facing the most treacherous political backdrop in years in the run-up to midterm elections in November. Biden jokes Trump was a 'horrible plague' in remarks at White House Correspondents' Dinner It\u2019s possible that high gas prices, the worst inflation in 40 years, the war in Ukraine and a persistent pandemic could all ease by November. But the trajectory of those crises \u2013 and the impact they exert on issues that matter to and can hurt Americans, like the price of groceries \u2013 could also get worse. China\u2019s major new struggle with Covid-19, for instance \u2013 fueled by its low vaccination rate \u2013 and its repressive lockdowns threaten to again crunch global supply chain lines that helped push inflation higher in the first place. And if the war in Ukraine, as expected, severely impacts the harvest in the breadbasket of Europe this year, Americans could see prices soar for daily staples since the invaded country is a huge source of global grain and sunflower oil. So it\u2019s quite likely that the daunting conditions that are currently depressing Democrats\u2019 hopes could actually get worse before Election Day. All of this explains a sense of inevitability settling into Washington\u2019s conventional wisdom that Republicans are strongly favored to retake the House of Representatives while the Senate could go red too. Some economic analysts have suggested that inflation \u2013 on its worst tear since the 1980s \u2013 has peaked. But a key index watched by the Federal Reserve \u2013 the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2013 was up 6.6% for the year ended in March, according to figures released last week. Energy prices spiked by the war in Ukraine were up 33.9% and food was up 9.2% over the same period. Another report last week showed a surprise decline in gross domestic product of 1.4% in the first quarter. While there were technical factors that might mean the figure is not as bad as it appears, it did spark fears of a recession, following warnings of a downturn on the horizon from several large Wall Street banks. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 These numbers get to the fundamental weakness of the Democrats\u2019 case as they approach the midterm elections. Biden cannot lock in full credit for the economy\u2019s strong rebound from the pandemic and historically good job numbers because millions of Americans are disgruntled by high prices. Biden\u2019s triumph in beating then-President Donald Trump in 2020 was an example of the power of comparisons. He offered a return to calm leadership after the tumult of the previous four years of scandals, lying and chaos in the White House. But the 2022 midterms are already turning into a referendum on the President and Democrats, who control all the levers of political power in Washington and therefore carry the can for the public\u2019s current discontent. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll published Sunday bears this out. While Biden\u2019s overall job approval rating ticked up to 42%, only 38% of those asked approved of his handling of the economy. And 68% disapproved of his record on inflation. The issue proved particularly irksome to independent voters who will be crucial in close House and Senate races in November. The President\u2019s plight on inflation has been exacerbated by his own White House\u2019s previous assertions that the heat up in prices was \u201ctransitory\u201d \u2013 a messaging error that threatens to detract from the trust voters have in administration pronouncements and that offers an easy target for Republicans. And while Biden has taken several steps to tackle high prices, including programs to unblock US ports and clogged supply chain and has released millions of barrels of oil from the nation\u2019s strategic reserves, his efforts don\u2019t seem to have had a noticeable impact on the lives of many Americans. And it\u2019s not clear that chalking up the high cost of living to \u201cPutin\u2019s price hike\u201d is getting him out of his political jam either. \u201cUltimately, the administration, when it comes on inflation, needs to stop saying they don\u2019t have anything they can do about it, right? That\u2019s usually one of the leads in saying, it\u2019s not our fault,\u201d Will Hurd, a former Republican congressman from Texas, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. A frustrated Joe Biden will go on the attack against Republicans in the midterms -- and into 2024 \u201cNobody wants to hear that. And they want to say, \u2018Hey, how are you going to get us out of this?\u2019\u201d The New York Times reported on Sunday, meanwhile, that Biden was repeatedly warned in a series of confidential polling memos that inflation and the nettlesome issue of immigration would erode his standing and the hopes of Democrats in the midterm elections. The memos, written between April 2021 and January 2022, were obtained in reporting for a new book, \u201cThis Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America\u2019s Future,\u201d by Times reporters Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin. \u201cVoters do not feel he has a plan to address the situation on the border, and it is starting to take a toll,\u201d John Anzalone, Biden\u2019s lead pollster, and his team wrote in one memo, according to the Times report. It was against this backdrop that Biden stood up in the vast ballroom of the Washington Hilton hotel on Saturday night and quipped: \u201cA special thanks to the 42% of you who actually applauded. I\u2019m really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.\u201d That the event was taking place at all was evidence of one of the successes of Biden\u2019s presidency \u2013 the rollout of vaccines and tests that have allowed many Americans to regain a semblance of their old lives two years after Covid-19 shut down the economy and changed the world. The President can also claim credit for a rare bipartisan triumph \u2013 an infrastructure law that eluded his predecessors. And his leadership helped build an unexpectedly unified Western response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which may have helped mitigate some of the political damage from the chaotic US evacuation from Afghanistan last year. Yet either these achievements are not resonating with the public, or the White House has failed to knit them into a coherent election narrative. The difficulties Biden has faced in enacting his vast social spending and climate plan, which has been blocked by moderate Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have added to the sense of drift. Whether Biden erred in pushing a sweeping reform agenda that some critics complained was not implied in his 2020 campaign, or the White House has failed to sell items like home health care for the elderly and free pre-kindergarten education in the vast Build Back Better bill, Biden has been deprived of the big win on a measure that was once compared to President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. Whether any of Biden\u2019s plan gets enacted still appears deeply uncertain, with time fast running out before the midterm campaign dominates the political summer. The deadlock threatens to dampen enthusiasm among Democratic base voters in November at the same time the Republican Party is running a campaign rooted in extreme positions on issues like trans rights, immigration and the teaching of race in America\u2019s schools to juice turnout among their most committed voters. The GOP is overlaying those themes with claims designed to appeal to more moderate voters that high food and gasoline prices show that Biden has wrecked the economy. The stalled Build Back Better plan has also stirred hints of acrimony inside the Democratic Party. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leading progressive, warned on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d last week that Democrats would lose their majorities if they \u201cdon\u2019t get up and deliver.\u201d Biden has been under pressure to fulfill a campaign promise to reduce student debt burdens after repeatedly extending a Trump-era pause of federal student loan repayments because of the pandemic. But forgiving $50,000 in debt per borrower \u2013 which Warren has called for \u2013 is not on the table, the President said at the White House last week after unveiling a request for millions more dollars in assistance for Ukraine. Biden hasn\u2019t made clear whether he would use executive power to immediately provide mass debt relief. Warren\u2019s comments contained more than a hint of a post-election blame game seven months before voters go to the polls. Yet they don\u2019t change the fact that the tiny Democratic majority in the 50-50 Senate means Biden doesn\u2019t have the technical capacity to force much of his agenda into law. While Biden made light of his political standing on Saturday night, he has privately complained the media has not focused on the comparison between his presidency and the lawlessness and scandals that defined Trump\u2019s term, CNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and Kevin Liptak reported last week. There\u2019s a chance that Trump\u2019s push for candidates reprising his election fraud lies in this month\u2019s GOP primaries will allow Biden to flesh out that theme in his own midterm campaigning. But as Republican Glenn Youngkin\u2019s gubernatorial victory in Virginia showed last November, Democrats can no longer count on a fierce anti-Trump campaign working when the ex-President is not on the ballot.",

            "article_content": "The leaders of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus are ramping up pressure on their leadership in a new effort to bring a series of bills to the House floor that they argue already have bipartisan backing and could help bolster incumbents ahead of the midterm elections from attacks that Congress isn\u2019t working. In their plan, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania call on their leadership to move ahead on seven areas, including an energy plan aimed at helping to lower gas prices, legislation to invest in law enforcement, a bill to support veterans\u2019 mental health, lower prescription drug costs and invest in cancer research, and a more controversial push to block the administration on a key immigration decision. A roadmap to the 2022 midterm elections It\u2019s the latest example of members running for reelection in some of the toughest districts in the country trying to get major legislation across the finish line before the politics of the midterm election year overshadow what\u2019s possible on the floor. It also comes as efforts to resurrect a Democratic-only package on energy, taxes and prescription drugs seem tenuous at best in the US Senate. \u201cWe need to focus on commonsense, bipartisan action that can actually get done and bring folks together,\u201d Gottheimer said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hear from folks back home. These are all areas where both sides can come together and actually get stuff done.\u201d The areas include several bipartisan pieces of legislation that members have already worked together on, bills that Gottheimer argues would have a good chance of passing of only they were to come to the floor for a vote. The members also call on leadership to move swiftly to block the administration\u2019s decision to end Title 42 on May 23, a flashpoint between some Democrats on Capitol Hill and the administration. The Trump-era immigration order, which has been used under former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, has allowed border officials to swiftly send migrants back to their home countries, citing a public health crisis. The order is expected to be reversed at the end of May, but the decision to end it has frustrated some front-line Democratic members, who have argued the administration still doesn\u2019t have a sufficient plan to deal with an expected uptick in migration once the order ends. Many of the moderate Democrats up for reelection have been hammered back home by Republican attacks on immigration. The midterms will decide the future of the January 6 investigation. Here's how the race for the House looks today The issue of Title 42 has become a major flashpoint in the Senate, where the immigration policy delayed the passage of a $10 billion Covid-19 relief package before the recess. Republicans had insisted on a vote on an amendment that would have blocked the administration from ending the policy. But Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had refused to allow the amendment on the floor, arguing that the immigration policy and Covid-19 funding were separate issues. Moving ahead to block the administration on Title 42 would certainly be met with strong opposition from some progressives, who had been pushing the administration for months on the issue. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Her critics say she fomented the January 6 insurrection, but Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene can\u2019t remember much about it. The congresswoman who prides herself on being a provocateur used variations of that theme \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d \u2013 more than 50 times during testimony in a Georgia courtroom last week. The hearing about whether to disqualify her from seeking reelection took place on Friday \u2013 before CNN published text messages on Monday in which Greene, in the weeks after Election Day 2020, suggested to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that then-President Donald Trump could declare martial law to change the results of the presidential election. RELATED: Mark Meadows\u2019 2,319 text messages reveal Trump\u2019s inner circle communications before and after January 6 Amnesia about January 2021 is in the air. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was caught in a lie, or an epic bout of forgetfulness, when he said last week he never considered calling on Trump to resign \u2013 before reporters for the New York Times produced audio of him doing just that. There\u2019s a big difference between lying, which isn\u2019t illegal, and lying under oath, which can be illegal. And there\u2019s a very open question about whether a lawmaker who rejected US democracy should get to work in the US government. The long-shot bid to remove Greene from the ballot is an unprecedented attempt to exclude someone from office and could be a trial run for an effort against Trump, who is primed to try to get his old job back. Here\u2019s what to know about the attempt to hold Greene accountable for her alleged role in the January 6 insurrection: No. Greene hasn\u2019t been charged with any crime and she denies doing anything other than calling for peaceful protest on January 6, 2021. There\u2019s not any indication she\u2019s under criminal investigation. In fact, despite hundreds of cases stemming from the insurrection, federal authorities haven\u2019t charged any public officials with violating the insurrection portion of US law, which would also ban a person from holding public office. The challenge to Greene\u2019s candidacy was initiated by a group of Georgia voters who are working with liberal activists and constitutional scholars. There is a provision of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution that bars officeholders who take part in or assist an insurrection from ever holding office again. The Georgia voters and liberal-leaning activist groups are using that provision to try to disqualify Greene from holding public office at the state or federal level in the future. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is quite short, but not very simple. Here\u2019s what it says: No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. Yes. But not in a very long time. The provision was passed to bar Confederates who had abandoned their oath to the US Constitution from government positions. That ban didn\u2019t last long, however. A blanket amnesty for former Confederates was passed in 1872, making the vast majority of the rebels again eligible for office. In 1898, it was removed for the last few hundred former Southern congressmen and senators. It was even symbolically removed for chief Confederates Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee with votes in Congress in the 1970s, even though both men had been dead for many decades. Greene was in the House and among the lawmakers who were evacuated when the Capitol was breached on January 6, 2021. She is not among the approximately 800 people who have been charged with taking part in the storming of the building. Rather, the group challenging Greene\u2019s candidacy says she helped inspire the insurrection and encouraged it. Here\u2019s what the attorney Andrew G. Celli Jr., who questioned Greene in court, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Monday: On January 5th, the day before the insurrection, Congresswoman Greene told her followers on her Facebook page, on a national broadcast, that tomorrow is 1776. Now, that\u2019s the kind of rhetoric \u2026 where people understood that 1776 was code for break into the Capitol, do violence, and most importantly, block the certification of Joe Biden. That is an act of insurrection. We demonstrated \u2026 and proved that. In her testimony last week, Greene said that in referring to 1776, she was talking about \u201cthe courage to object\u201d to the counting of electoral votes. Greene denied knowledge of any scheme to disrupt the electoral vote count in Congress and said she didn\u2019t know key players who organized the rally that preceded the congressional breach. She also fiercely rebuked any suggestions that violence was what she had in mind as she called for protests and objections to Congress\u2019 certification of Biden\u2019s win. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen rounded up some of the larger things \u2013 extremely pertinent details \u2013 to slip Greene\u2019s mind: She said she didn\u2019t remember saying she opposed the peaceful transfer of power to President Joe Biden \u2013 right before lawyers for the challengers played a video of her saying just that. She denied calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \u201ctraitor\u201d who might deserve the death penalty, but backtracked and acknowledged the comment when the challengers started to play the footage. State Judge Charles Beaudrot, who presided over the hearing in Georgia, will make a recommendation within the next few weeks and then Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger will make the decision. Appeals are likely. \u201cThere will be court appeals. This will go to the Georgia Supreme Court ultimately,\u201d Celli said. Yes, we are. Ballots have been printed and it\u2019s scheduled for May 24. In the event Greene was disqualified from the ballot, local officials would have to communicate to voters and post notices at polling places that votes for Greene would not be counted, according to Cohen\u2019s report. There was a similar effort against Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn in North Carolina, but a federal judge shut it down. If the effort is successful against Greene, there\u2019s a school of thought it could be used against Trump in 2024. One basic principle of democracy is that voters should get to choose their leaders. The hard question is whether they should get to choose a leader who rejected the outcome of democracy in 2020. Greene\u2019s lawyers have also argued that the disqualification hearing was inherently unfair and that the challengers were trampling on her free-speech rights. Sort of. Lawmakers refused to allow her to sit on committees because of controversial statements she\u2019s made, although only a handful of Republicans voted against her. Greene continues to be popular with the hard right of the party. And there are indications the party is moving toward her. She\u2019s traveling with McCarthy to the border with Mexico this week to raise the alarm about Biden\u2019s immigration policy. This is the strange state of the US political scene, where those searching for accountability for the Capitol insurrection continue to run into roadblocks while Republican leaders, in their effort to move on, are eying big gains if frustrated voters turn on Democrats in November.",

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s latest vow of loyalty to ex-President Donald Trump offers the clearest signal yet about the character of the likely Republican House majority that could rock Washington next year. The Californian\u2019s quickly exposed denial last week of a true, private remark that he might ask Trump to resign after the January 6 riot was important not just because it added a new detail about the attack on US democracy in 2021. Rather, the choice he made \u2013 between telling a blatant lie or destroying his own dream of being speaker by confirming the truth and alienating the ex-President \u2013 reveals the vital power calculation underpinning the modern GOP. That dynamic hands Trump enormous potential proxy power if the party makes good on its strong prospects and wins the House of Representatives in November. McCarthy to lead GOP lawmakers, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, to southern border In a sign that McCarthy may have mended some fences over the weekend and is trying to bolster his standing in Trump world, the House minority leader will lead a GOP delegation, which includes Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, to the southern US border on Monday. Greene, an extreme pro-Trump lawmaker, has warned McCarthy will have to satisfy a series of demands before he gets votes for speaker from her and like-minded Republican representatives. The trip will underscore how immigration \u2013 perhaps Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2013 is a glue that unites GOP factions and is at the center of the party\u2019s midterm election quest given the White House\u2019s vulnerabilities on the issue. The McCarthy drama, which for a while last week threatened to shatter his career \u2013 until an outwardly magnanimous Trump collected his vow of loyalty \u2013 was triggered when two New York Times reporters revealed that McCarthy had told fellow top Republicans that he was considering advising Trump to step down after the insurrection in January last year. The House minority leader flatly denied the claim and slammed the reporters, Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, as tools of a biased, corporate media. But appearing on MSNBC, the reporters soon revealed a tape that obliterated McCarthy\u2019s denials and appeared to leave him on wafer thin ground. In another time, McCarthy\u2019s eviscerated credibility might have destroyed his political future. But in an age in which most GOP power depends on Trump\u2019s patronage, McCarthy\u2019s subsequent recommitment to the Trump movement might have actually strengthened his claims to the speakership. And it proved that anyone with aspirations of power in the GOP, at least in the House, must make a similar decision to prioritize loyalty to Trump over simple facts and truth. Why it matters that Kevin McCarthy lied This is not a partisan point \u2013 it\u2019s borne out by events of four tumultuous years of the Trump presidency, two impeachments and the ex-President\u2019s lies that the 2020 election was a fraud. And it represents judgments by lawmakers about the views of their constituents in the pro-Trump base of the party, which remains strongly aligned with the ex-President and favorable to his alternative 2020 reality. McCarthy and Trump spoke Thursday night to discuss the Times story. The younger man\u2019s apparent success in papering over what could have been a political nightmare suggests that the same unwillingness to speak truth to the ex-President\u2019s excesses that marked the GOP during his term in office will be a dominant feature of American politics in the midterm campaign and ahead of the 2024 election if Trump runs. McCarthy\u2019s conduct has confirmed that a future GOP House majority would operate as a political subsidiary for the ex-President. This will give Trump a powerful weapon in Washington as he seeks to destroy the presidency of Joe Biden, his vanquisher in the 2020 election and possible 2024 rival. In practice, it would mean McCarthy gives even greater latitude to vehemently pro-Trump members of the GOP conference \u2013 like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who is vowing to pummel the Biden White House with investigations if Republicans get the speaker\u2019s gavel next year. Given that he\u2019s even more in Trump\u2019s debt than before, McCarthy may be in less of a position to reign in GOP radicals like Greene. The Georgia Republican, testifying last week in an unprecedented disqualification hearing probing whether she should be barred from office over her alleged role in the January 6 insurrection, repeatedly said she could not remember past comments or interactions and repeated false claims about Trump winning the election. In a broader sense, events of the last few days pose grave questions for American democracy since Trump\u2019s authoritarian streak has only become more extreme as he sought to overturn the 2020 election and seeks to turn the 2022 midterms into a pageant of personal revenge. And there is even less evidence that the House GOP, which has worked to whitewash his incitement on January 6, 2021, has the interest or the political capacity to do anything to curtail him in the future. Trump understands the power dynamic perfectly. McCarthy\u2019s phone call with the ex-President after the audio emerged reestablished that his future was in Trump\u2019s hands and reinforced perceptions that Trump is the true locus of GOP power. The ex-President relishes public displays of fealty. It suits him and his zeal for power for McCarthy to be portrayed in the media as his puppet and for McCarthy to turn political somersaults to retain Trump\u2019s favor. Thus, the ex-President told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that his relationship with McCarthy remains good because the minority leader had quickly moved to row back his apparent criticism. And referring to Republicans, who have largely embraced him after slamming his role in the Capitol insurrection, Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s all a big compliment, frankly,\u201d adding, \u201cThey realized they were wrong and supported me.\u201d Still, the latest example of Trump\u2019s dominance of the GOP could play into Democratic claims that the former President represents a mortal danger to American democracy. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday that McCarthy\u2019s conduct in recent days showed that he was a \u201cliar and a traitor.\u201d \u201cThis is outrageous. And that is really the illness that pervades the Republican leadership right now, that they say one thing to the American public and something else in private,\u201d Warren said. Warren: Democrats will lose 2022 midterms if we don't deliver more But the gravest moment of danger for McCarthy appears to have passed \u2013 at least for now \u2013 though there are no guarantees when it comes to Trump. The ex-President has a long record of souring on subordinates he once indulged. He, for instance, withdrew his endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks\u2019 Senate campaign after the Alabama congressman said it was time to move on from the 2020 election. So McCarthy\u2019s speakership hopes \u2013 already facing some skepticism from the pro-Trump wing of the GOP \u2013 will never be a sure thing right up until the moment that Republicans claim power if they win back the House in November. But the California Republican can also count on strong loyalty of many of the GOP rank and file in the House, partly through his prodigious fundraising. Some party lawmakers told CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona, Manu Raju and Lauren Fox in recent days that the leader was not seriously damaged by the episode. McCarthy has long considered the support of Trump\u2019s base the critical factor in winning back the House. His entire strategy of downplaying the fallout from the January 6 insurrection has been directed toward this aim. And a huge GOP win in November would also bolster McCarthy\u2019s authority and long-held hopes of becoming speaker. Political circumstances appear to be aligning with his goal. With each month that passes, the plight of Democrats \u2013 plagued by high gas prices and raging inflation \u2013 fails to improve and the McCarthy victory scenario becomes even more plausible. While there are profound questions raised by Trump\u2019s enduring power, the failure of the Biden administration to meaningfully ease higher prices for everyday goods \u2013 even if other parts of the economy are roaring back \u2013 offers Republicans compelling arguments to make to voters. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who flipped a Biden state last fall, showed that Democratic campaigns rooted in the danger from Trump can be neutralized by sharp attacks on them over costly grocery bills and perceptions about a politicized education system. And while Washington commentators and Democratic lawmakers highlight the blatant nature of McCarthy\u2019s lies, the fragmented and hyper-partisan nature of US media means their concerns will not move most Republican voters. Therein lies the essential logic behind McCarthy\u2019s choice: the only outcome of his latest controversy that could imperil his hopes of becoming speaker would be if he ended up further estranged from Trump. So his path forward was obvious. And that is likely to have huge consequences for what Washington looks like in January 2023 and beyond.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic rebellion against President Joe Biden\u2019s plans to lift pandemic-era border restrictions is growing, as candidates in marquee races from Nevada to New Hampshire break with the administration and Republicans turn immigration into a centerpiece of their midterm election messaging. The Biden administration is set to roll back next month the public health authority known as Title 42, which was first invoked by then-President Donald Trump. The measure allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries because of the public health crisis. Democratic senators in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire \u2013 all top GOP targets this year \u2013 have already sought to distance themselves from Biden\u2019s move, charging that the White House has not adequately planned for a surge in border crossings. Biden administration asks federal judge to deny request to immediately block end of Title 42 That criticism expanded this week into governor\u2019s races in two Southwestern swing states, Arizona and Nevada. Katie Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state and front-runner for the Democratic nomination for governor, urged Biden to reverse his \u201crash decision\u201d and said lifting Title 42 \u201cwithout a clear plan to secure our border would be a disaster.\u201d In Nevada, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak warned the President in a letter of a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d at the southern border if the public health authority is repealed without a \u201ccomprehensive plan.\u201d Republicans, meanwhile, are pouncing on the issue. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm, on Thursday launched a $1 million television advertising campaign tying Sen. Mark Kelly to Biden\u2019s move because of the Arizona Democrat\u2019s August vote against an amendment that would have required the Department of Homeland Security to expel migrants who illegally enter the country and may contribute to the spread of Covid-19. \u201cKelly voted to allow restrictions to be lifted, which will cause a massive new border surge,\u201d a narrator says in the ad. \u201cTell Sen. Kelly: Stop voting with Biden and against Arizona.\u201d Kelly campaign spokeswoman Sarah Guggenheimer countered by saying the senator \u201chas delivered increased border security resources, introduced bipartisan legislation to address the crisis, and has stood up to both the Biden administration and his own party to ensure a safe, humane, and orderly process at the border.\u201d The Biden administration is on track to end Title 42 on May 23. The decision, made by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ignited concerns about a migrant surge. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN this week his department has \u201cplans\u201d to address the expected surge. But he would not elaborate. Tensions run high as Biden administration gets earful from some panicked lawmakers over Title 42 \u201cI think we have to be very mindful of the fact that we are addressing enemies, and those enemies are the cartels and the smugglers, and I will not provide our plans to them. We are going to proceed with our execution, carefully, methodically, in anticipating different scenarios,\u201d he said. Vulnerable Democratic lawmakers plan to use a House Judiciary Committee hearing featuring Mayorkas next week to distance themselves from the Biden administration\u2019s decision, congressional aides say. They plan to grill the secretary, whose answers could offer a window into how the White House will defend its position. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the administration was \u201cplanning and preparing\u201d for the May 23 rollback of Title 42 but remains open to conversations with lawmakers about immigration reform. More than 20 states, mostly GOP-led, on Thursday asked a federal judge in Louisiana to immediately block the administration from ending Title 42. The administration on Friday asked the judge to deny the request. The Democratic divide over Title 42 pits candidates in swing states and vulnerable incumbents against not just Biden\u2019s White House but more progressive Democrats and immigration advocates. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York is among the most vocal advocates of ending Title 42 border restrictions. Last month, Schumer, along with Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla of California, and Bob Menendez and Cory Booker of New Jersey, said there was \u201cno public health benefit to sending asylum seekers back to harm\u201d and urged Biden \u201cto stop breathing new life into this inhumane Trump policy.\u201d Three weeks later, the administration announced it would lift the pandemic restrictions. Some Democrats up for reelection this year, such as Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, have faced condemnation from the left for criticizing Biden\u2019s move to roll back Title 42. Kelly and New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan, who both visited the US-Mexico border earlier this month, signed on to a Republican-backed bill that would delay the rollback. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who has also urged Biden to reconsider his plans, has faced criticism from Republicans for signing a June 2020 letter that urged Trump to back off what the letter called a \u201cCDC asylum ban.\u201d Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who chairs Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, said this week that the Biden administration might need to delay the rollback of Title 42 until a clearer plan to mitigate the flow of migrants at the southern border is in place. The Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman said he understands why his colleagues running for reelection might be willing to come out against Biden. \u201cI think they are right to raise questions. This is a very serious issue,\u201d said Peters, who is not up for reelection this year. \u201cThe senators have to take a position that they think is best for their state.\u201d Meanwhile, Democratic opposition to the Biden administration\u2019s move has mounted across the map of competitive Senate races in November\u2019s midterm elections. Senate front-runner in Pennsylvania embraces Biden and progressive agenda amid Democrats' midterm dilemma In Pennsylvania, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an otherwise strong supporter of Biden\u2019s policies, broke with the White House on Title 42. \u201cI think there should be a little bit more thought given into that. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there just yet, quite frankly,\u201d Fetterman said in an interview. US Rep. Conor Lamb, another Senate contender in Pennsylvania, told CNN he is a \u201cskeptic\u201d of the planned rollback. \u201cI will certainly listen to any argument that the administration wants to make,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut you know, the pandemic is not over. That\u2019s why Title 42 went into place was to just try to help control what was happening down there in light of the pandemic and how things can spread and particularly with these different variants.\u201d In Wisconsin, Democrats hoping to unseat Republican Sen. Ron Johnson this fall lambasted Biden over Title 42. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry have all called for the administration to offer a plan to keep both asylum seekers and US residents safe before lifting the public health authority. Florida Rep. Val Demings, who is challenging GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, was a top contender for Biden\u2019s running mate in 2020. Her campaign spokesman Christian Slater said Demings, a former Orlando police chief, did not support lifting Title 42 \u201cuntil there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.\u201d Democratic Senate candidates in red-leaning states have also spoken out. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, the leading Democrat in an open-seat Senate race, has co-sponsored a bill that would prevent the Biden administration from what he calls a \u201cwrong and reckless\u201d decision to lift the Title 42 restrictions. \u201cPrematurely ending this policy without a path forward does nothing to keep Americans safe, support our Border Patrol agents, protect asylum-seekers, or bring about the comprehensive fix our immigration system needs,\u201d Ryan said. And retired Marine Lucas Kunce, a top candidate for the open seat in Missouri, said, \u201cRepealing Title 42 with no actual plan isn\u2019t policy \u2013 it\u2019s politics.\u201d CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox, Priscilla Alvarez, Manu Raju, Paradise Afshar, Andy Rose and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It was hard to escape the headlines this past week about President Joe Biden and young voters. \u201cDemocrats ring alarm bells over young voters\u201d \u201cBiden\u2019s challenge: getting his mojo back with younger voters\u201d \u201cYounger voters are turning on Biden more than any other age group: poll\u201d Such headlines are not surprising when a president is struggling in the polls. People always want to find an explanation for what is going wrong. The debate over young voters is where we start our statistical journey this week, and why all may not be what it appears at first glance. If you look at any polling trendline over the past year, it\u2019s been troubling for Biden. His approval rating has dropped by more than 10 points. A recent Gallup report, which I highlighted last week, points to his falling popularity with young Americans as the problem. Biden\u2019s approval rating with Americans 18-29 years old is just 38% in aggregated Gallup data since September. From January 2021 to June 2021, it was 61% \u2013 about the same percentage of the vote he earned among voters under 30 in the 2020 election. Joe Biden's numbers are collapsing among a group you really wouldn't expect Biden\u2019s popularity among young Americans went from being higher than any other age group to being lower than almost any other age group. Sometimes, however, approval ratings don\u2019t tell the whole story. In this case, these approval ratings might suggest that the Democrats will lose among young voters in the midterm elections. A look at the generic ballot, on other hand, indicates that would be wrong. Take a look at data from the Pew Research Center, which polled both the generic congressional ballot and Biden\u2019s approval rating in March. (The generic ballot usually asks respondents some form of the following question: \u201cIf the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican Party?\u201d) Biden\u2019s approval rating among voters under 30 was 39%. This, of course, is very similar to Gallup\u2019s reading of this age group. When voters under 30 were asked who they would vote for in their congressional district, Democrats held a 48% to 29% advantage over the Republicans. That 48% vote share and 19-point lead were better from Democrats than responses from any other age group. This poll is no outlier. A CNN/SSRS poll from January and February put Biden\u2019s approval rating at 43% among voters under 30. Democrats\u2019 lead on the generic congressional ballot was 15 points.  Averaging CNN and Pew data puts Democrats\u2019 lead at 17 points among voters under 30. (Averaging other polling, from Fox News and Quinnipiac University, backs this up, as they had Democrats ahead by 12 to 13 points in the larger age group of 18-34 year olds. A slightly smaller advantage when including some older voters is expected.) Democrats won the national House vote among voters under 30 by, depending on the source, somewhere between 22 (Catalist) and 26 (the network exit polls) points in 2020. That averages out to a 24-point margin. The fact that the current Democratic lead among young voters is 7 points less than their 2020 margin with this group makes a lot of sense. The political environment has shifted against the party, as the generic congressional ballot shows Democrats doing worse among all voters by a similar margin \u2013 about 5 to 6 points. If nothing else, it\u2019s a sign that, even if Biden isn\u2019t liked by most young Americans, Republicans haven\u2019t come anywhere close to sealing the deal with them. I should further note that Biden has had previous issues with young voters, only to recover later. His advantage with this group during the early parts of the 2020 general election campaign was significantly smaller than Hillary Clinton\u2019s in the 2016 election. By the end of the campaign, he outperformed her. That\u2019s not to say all is good for Democrats among young voters ahead of the midterm elections. Just 10% of voters under 30 said they were extremely enthusiastic about casting a ballot this fall in CNN\u2019s most recent poll on the topic. A higher percentage of voters overall (24%) indicated they were extremely enthusiastic. That\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary, though. Younger voters were less enthusiastic, by about 10 points, at this point in 2018 as well, and turnout with this group is always lower than that of voters of other ages. This doesn\u2019t mean that young voter enthusiasm won\u2019t drop more or that Biden\u2019s unpopularity won\u2019t affect them. It\u2019s just that for now, it hasn\u2019t. Democrats have larger fish to fry, with the national political environment turning against them. Anyone who has read or watched me on TV over the last six months knows that I\u2019m extremely pessimistic about Democrats\u2019 chances of holding on to the US House in 2022. Part of the reason is Biden\u2019s unpopularity and a lack of historical precedent for the type of recovery he would need in his approval rating to not be a drag on his party. But that doesn\u2019t mean Biden\u2019s approval rating won\u2019t recover eventually. In fact, I would make the statistical argument that Biden\u2019s 2024 stock is undervalued in the betting markets, with him getting roughly equal odds of winning with Ron DeSantis (between 20 and 25%). Ron DeSantis' governing strategy in Florida is paying off No one, except for Biden himself, knows how serious he is about running for another term. He is already the oldest president. Yet, there hasn\u2019t been an elected president who has chosen not to run for a second term in more than 140 years. The reporting out there suggests Biden is far more likely to run if former President Donald Trump runs, and almost all signs point to Trump running. At a minimum, Biden would be a heavy favorite to win his party\u2019s nomination were he to run. His approval rating among Democrats has been hovering at or above 80%, according to data from Gallup. Historically, incumbents with an approval rating of 80% or higher within their own party by the time of the presidential primaries have not faced serious challenges. Sitting presidents who either lost a primary or dropped out of running for another term all had approval ratings among their party\u2019s voters of below 70%. (George H.W. Bush, who didn\u2019t lose a primary but was challenged by Pat Buchanan in 1992, had an approval rating in the low 70s.) As for the general election, keep in mind that most presidents who make it to November have won reelection. They have won about two-thirds of the time. That general percentage holds whether you look at elections over the last 40 years or the last 100 years. Trump nearly pulled it off, despite consistently having low approval ratings and facing a global pandemic and a middling economy in his reelection year. The fact is there is no significant correlation between approval ratings at this point in a president\u2019s term and whether he gets reelected. Nor is there any significant correlation between how the president\u2019s party does in a midterm and whether he gets reelected. And although voters are upset over the state of the economy now, there is, if anything, a negative correlation between early economic performance and a president\u2019s reelection chances. The bottom line is I have no clue who is going to win 2024, though betting on an incumbent president is usually a pretty decent bet. This past week, some Americans celebrated the nonofficial marijuana holiday of 4/20. Though this analyst has never partaken in the doobie (or its offshoots, such as the doobie brownie), he acknowledges that an increasing percentage of Americans want marijuana legal. A Gallup poll from late last year found that 68% of Americans believed marijuana should be legalized. Fifty years ago, less than 20% of Americans thought it should be. April 17 brief encounter: Last week, I pointed out that Google searches for \u201cchurch\u201d usually peak around Easter. Sure enough, data indicates that more people searched for \u201cchurch\u201d last week than in any week since the coronavirus pandemic began. Masking is way down: This week, a federal judge reversed a government rule requiring masks on public transportation. Although the ruling is being appealed, Americans have increasingly been leaving masks behind. This month, Axios/Ipsos recorded, for the first time in two years, that less than half of Americans (44%) said they were always or sometimes wearing a mask when leaving their home. Democrats and illegal immigration: As recently as 2006, 42% of Democrats said they worried a great deal about illegal immigration, according to Gallup polling. Today, it\u2019s just 18%. Meanwhile, a record high percentage of Democrats (44%) say they\u2019re not worried at all. That\u2019s up 32 points from 16 years ago. Title IX and its impact: Most Americans (63%) who have heard of Title IX \u2013 which requires equal treatment of women and men at academic institutions that receive funding from the federal government \u2013 think the law has had a positive impact, according to the Pew Research Center. There\u2019s a large partisan divide, however, with 75% of Democrats saying it has been positive compared with 49% of Republicans.",

            "article_content": "Mitch McConnell knew that what happened on January 6, 2021, was deeply wrong. And that blame for the riot that day lay at the feet of then-President Donald Trump. We now have definitive proof of that fact, thanks to a new excerpt published Thursday from the forthcoming book \u201cThis Will Not Pass\u201d by New York Times reporters Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin. \u201cThe Democrats are going to take care of the son of a bitch for us,\u201d McConnell told two associates just days after the insurrection, referring to the effort to impeach Trump in the Democratic-led House, according to the Times\u2019 reporters. And of Trump\u2019s guilt, McConnell was equally clear-eyed: \u201cIf this isn\u2019t impeachable, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he said. There was even talk that McConnell himself might vote to convict Trump in a Senate impeachment trial. But as the days passed, McConnell\u2019s position on Trump changed \u2013 to the point that when the Senate voted on whether to convict Trump in mid-February 2021, McConnell voted \u201cno.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! So what changed McConnell\u2019s mind? Did he conduct an analysis of Trump\u2019s behavior that day and find evidence that exonerated the President? Nope! \u201cI didn\u2019t get to be leader by voting with five people in the conference,\u201d the Times\u2019 reporters quote McConnell as telling a friend by way of explaining his change of heart. Uh, what? On one level, McConnell is absolutely right. The way that you rise into leadership \u2013 in any party \u2013 is by successfully channeling the collective will of your colleagues. Charging at windmills is not the stuff of which successful leadership bids are made. But there is a big difference between doing the things that can get you elected to leadership and being, you know, an actual leader. Just a quick reminder of what happened at the Capitol on January 6: An armed mob stormed the building with the express purpose of disrupting the counting of the Electoral College votes. They did so because the sitting President of the United States at the time had, repeatedly and without any proof, told them that the 2020 election had been stolen. Several people died as a result of that day. More than 100 police officers were injured. Roughly 750 people have been charged for their role in the riot. This is not, in short, a debate over immigration or education policy. In those situations, it makes sense that McConnell would take the temperature of his fellow Republican senators before offering up his position. But we are talking about an armed assault on the US Capitol here! This was \u2013 and is \u2013 a moment when real leadership is demanded. When political calculations about your standing in the Senate should go out the window because, well, democracy is literally being attacked right in front of you. That\u2019s not what McConnell did. Instead, he pulled back from his initial \u2013 and utterly justified \u2013 principled outrage over Trump\u2019s actions (and inaction) because the majority of his party didn\u2019t share his view. That\u2019s not leadership. It\u2019s the opposite. And the abdication of leadership by McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and others within the Republican Party are why Trump is stronger than ever today \u2013 as he continues to actively work to undermine the public\u2019s confidence in American elections.",

            "article_content": "With all the focus of late on inflation and its impact on the coming midterm elections, we may be overlooking another issue gaining traction among the American public: immigration. More than 4 in 10 Americans told Gallup in March that they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of worry about \u201cillegal immigration,\u201d which is how the firm framed the issue in its survey. That number, which was consistent with Gallup\u2019s polling last year as well, is on the high end of their survey findings on the issue over the past decade. And considerable concern is primarily on the rise among politically critical independent voters. In 2018, just 3 in 10 independents said they had a great deal of concern about the issue. Now that number stands at 39%. What should be even more concerning for President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress is that these numbers from Gallup came before the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it would be suspending Title 42, a provision that allows border agents to turn away immigrants seeking asylum which has been in place since March 2020. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! The Biden administration said earlier this month that Title 42 will be rescinded on May 23. And in the weeks since that announcement, a number of Democratic incumbents and candidates have voiced their concerns with the possibility that the US-Mexico border will be overwhelmed. \u201cUntil there is a plan, you got to have secure borders,\u201d Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told CNN at the end of March. \u201cTo do something that might invite a doubling, tripling, quadrupling of numbers at the border, that is not in the best interest of America, that is not in the best interest of the administration, or the people who are trying to go through the process.\u201d Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who chairs the Democrats\u2019 Senate campaign arm, echoed those concerns this week. \u201cUnless we have a well thought out plan, I think it is something that should be revisited and perhaps delayed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to defer judgment on that until I give the administration the opportunity to fully articulate what that plan is. But I share \u2026 concerns of some of my colleagues.\u201d To be clear: Inflation and gas prices \u2013 as well as more general concerns about the state and direction of the economy \u2013 continue to dominate most Americans\u2019 minds. But, immigration \u2013 and the administration\u2019s ability to control it or not (particularly in light of the Title 42 decision) \u2013 is nudging its way into the midterm conversation as well. A glut of people trying to cross the border once Title 42 is rescinded \u2013 and the resulting media coverage \u2013 could make the issue top of mind for many more voters. And judging from the polling data, that would take what already looks like a tough election for Democrats and make it even worse.",

            "article_content": "States across the country are rolling back access to abortion, and the fate of Roe v. Wade is up in the air \u2013 two factors that Democrats believe could elevate the issue of abortion rights this midterm cycle to a level not reached in recent memory. The flurry of legislative action in states such as Oklahoma, Arizona, Kentucky and Florida comes as the US Supreme Court is expected to rule this summer on a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, as campaign season kicks into high gear. At a hearing last year, the high court\u2019s conservative majority signaled its intent to uphold the law, going against decades of precedent. As a result, Democratic candidates across the country are prioritizing the issue of reproductive rights in their 2022 campaigns. Texas abortion ban is an early glimpse of what post-Roe America would look like for women Planned Parenthood is planning to run its \u201clargest ever midterm electoral program to support candidates up and down the ballot who support our reproductive rights,\u201d according to Jenny Lawson, vice president of organizing, engagement and campaigns at Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Heather Williams, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which supports Democrats in state legislative races, said the group is hoping to \u201cturn the outrage and frustration into votes.\u201d Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Republican State Leadership Committee, the DLCC\u2019s GOP counterpart, told CNN the Democrats\u2019 strategy of running on abortion rights will be futile. \u201cWhat voters are most concerned about right now is inflation, the cost of living, education and crime,\u201d the RSLC\u2019s Andrew Romeo said. According to a CNN poll conducted earlier this year, most Americans oppose overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established a nationwide right to an abortion, with a majority saying that if the decision were vacated, they\u2019d want to see their own state move toward more permissive abortion laws. CNN spoke with several Democratic candidates, running in part on the premise that the future of abortion rights is on the ballot in November, in states where either new abortion restrictions have been enacted or a Democratic governor has vetoed Republican-backed bills attempting to curtail abortion rights. A controversial state law that bans abortions as early as six weeks went into effect in September, after the US Supreme Court and a federal appeals court opted not to rule on pending emergency requests brought by abortion providers. The law also allows private citizens to bring civil suits against anyone who assists a pregnant person seeking an abortion. Rochelle Garza, running for state attorney general Rochelle Garza, who faces a May primary runoff for the Democratic nomination for attorney general, was nine weeks pregnant when Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban went into effect. She told CNN her candidacy for attorney general was in part inspired by the ban. \u201cSB 8 was atrocious,\u201d Garza, who gave birth to her daughter last month, said of the Texas bill. \u201cIt has such a deep impact on people\u2019s lives in a way that our (elected officials) do not understand.\u201d \u201cI want something better for my daughter\u2019s future, and I think that\u2019s ultimately what brings it home for me and why I\u2019m running for this office,\u201d she said. If she wins her primary, Garza could find herself running against a familiar opponent. As an attorney in private practice, she fought in court against Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s efforts to insert himself in a case to help the Trump administration prevent her client, a detained 17-year-old immigrant, from accessing an abortion. Garza and the ACLU won that case. Paxton is seeking a third term this year and has a primary runoff of his own to get through in May. Becca DeFelice, running for the Texas House Becca DeFelice, the Democratic nominee for a Texas House district that includes part of San Antonio, told CNN that being the mother of a 12-year-old daughter informed her decision to run for office. \u201cRunning for office really is something that I\u2019m doing for her, for her future and for the future of other little girls like her in the state,\u201d said DeFelice, a former organizer with the gun violence prevention organization Moms Demand Action. \u201cWith choice, we know that this is a central issue to my district,\u201d she said, citing the high number of people in her district who donate to Planned Parenthood South Texas. \u201cWe know that this is a huge issue not just for Democratic voters but for Republican women as well.\u201d DeFelice is challenging Republican state Rep. Steve Allison, whose campaign website notes that he is \u201cpro-life and is endorsed by two prominent pro-life organizations.\u201d Jessica Cisneros, running for the US House of Representatives Jessica Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration attorney, advanced to a May primary runoff against Rep. Henry Cuellar \u2013 a political institution in South Texas who was the only House Democrat to vote against the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would codify abortion rights even if the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade. (Republicans blocked the bill in the Senate.) \u201cHe doubled down on his anti-choice stance and said abortion wasn\u2019t health care. This is why I\u2019m running because our community deserves someone who will always fight tooth and nail for our health care,\u201d Cisneros told CNN in a statement. Cueller, according to the Laredo Morning Times, said in a Zoom conference last year that he had backed \u201cmillions of dollars on health care for women\u201d but that abortion was \u201cnot a health issue.\u201d \u201cFor me,\u201d Cisneros said, \u201cknowing how many people are being affected and have lost their right to health care, you just can\u2019t be a bystander.\u201d Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law Thursday a GOP-led bill that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, allowing only for exceptions involving \u201cserious risk\u201d to the pregnant person and fatal fetal abnormality but with no exceptions for rape or incest. Florida state Sen. Lauren Book, running for reelection Lauren Book, the state Senate minority leader, is a survivor of child sexual abuse. She delivered an impassioned floor speech before Florida\u2019s abortion ban legislation passed the state Senate last month, pleading with her GOP colleagues to reconsider exceptions in cases of rape or incest. \u201cAny attempt to limit a woman\u2019s right to choose in my opinion is extreme. To then couple that with no exception for rape, incest or human trafficking, to me, that is the state imposing cruel and unusual punishments on victims of crimes. And that is beyond offensive as a woman, as a survivor of sexual assault and as a human being,\u201d Book said in an interview with CNN. She said survivors of rape or incest need time to physically and mentally heal. \u201cThey should be given the opportunity to have more time to make that choice,\u201d she said. Asked how the state\u2019s abortion ban and other controversial legislation would affect her reelection campaign, Book said, \u201cYou put the loss aside, and you keep on fighting.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re recruiting people to run around the state, particularly focusing on a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d she said. Janelle Perez, running for the Florida state Senate Janelle Perez, who is seeking a state Senate seat in Miami, is one of the candidates Book helped encourage to run. Perez, who is a lesbian and Cuban American, said she\u2019s running because she wants \u201cto see legislators that look like my community making decisions for my community.\u201d Florida was once the perennial swing state. 2022 may prove how red it has become \u201cI am the daughter of Cuban exiles. For me, the reason why my family fled communism and a dictatorship is for freedom and that includes reproductive freedoms, that includes my choice as a woman to make decisions for my own body,\u201d she said. Being a mother also influences Perez\u2019s campaign. \u201cMy wife and I want our girls to grow up in a Florida that affords them the same rights that we had growing up,\u201d Perez said last month. \u201cWith the 15-week abortion ban that just passed, they are already growing up in a Florida that has less rights.\u201d State Rep. Anna Eskamani, running for reelection State Rep. Anna Eskamani told CNN that when it comes to women\u2019s health and reproductive rights, her earlier experience working at Planned Parenthood shapes her perspective. \u201cIt really allows you to have a great deal of empathy for an issue that has become hyper-political and partisan,\u201d she said. \u201cI know patients who have made this decision. I have walked with women past protesters to help them feel safe. I have watched their children because they couldn\u2019t afford child care.\u201d Eskamani said that while she\u2019s \u201cnever been shy\u201d about her past work, her focus recently has been on constituent services for Floridians who she said are more concerned with housing, rent and small business relief than cultural topics that have animated the state GOP. But a statewide election is a different matter, Eskamani said. \u201cMy job is making sure folks understand what\u2019s at stake, so they realize that elections have consequences. And if you agree that this type of government overreach is inappropriate, then you need to come out and vote,\u201d she said. Aramis Ayala, running for state attorney general Aramis Ayala, a civil rights advocate, public defender and former Florida state attorney, said the 15-week abortion ban is \u201cone of the primary reasons\u201d she decided to run for attorney general in the Sunshine State. \u201cWhile you have a governor who\u2019s consistently saying, \u2018This is a free state,\u2019 well, in this situation, not if you\u2019re a woman, not if you\u2019re gay, not if you\u2019re a Black or brown or poor person who wants to vote. Freedom only exists for a certain amount of people, and we should be looking for freedom for all Floridians,\u201d said Ayala, who was Florida\u2019s first Black elected state attorney. DeSantis, for his part, has defended the new law. \u201cThese are protections for babies that have heartbeats, that can feel pain, and this is very, very late,\u201d he said at an event last month. \u201cAnd so, I think when you\u2019re talking about late term, you know, that\u2019s one thing. And so, you know, I think the protections are warranted.\u201d As attorney general, Ayala told CNN, she would reimagine the scope of the role to focus on constitutionality over culture war priorities. \u201cI would ride on the Constitution, I would ride on people\u2019s rights, I would ride on the dignity of people and make certain that anyone who was attempting to belittle, minimize or eliminate the rights of the people would not be able to pass such unconstitutional, problematic legislation without a fight,\u201d she said. In 2019, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who is running for reelection this year, signed into law a bill that would ban abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy \u2013 when many women don\u2019t yet know they\u2019re pregnant. A federal judge blocked the ban from going into effect. State Sen. Jen Jordan, running for state attorney general State Sen. Jen Jordan, who is running for attorney general, fears Georgia is \u201cgoing to be getting a double whammy\u201d should Roe v. Wade be overturned and the state\u2019s heartbeat bill be resurrected. Lawmaker shares personal loss in abortion bill dissent During debate over the bill in 2019, Jordan gave a floor speech in which she shared intimate details about her experience with multiple miscarriages. \u201cThe issue of choice is much bigger than just about access to abortion care. It really is about women having autonomy over their bodies and having control over their lives,\u201d she said. Jordan said that while speaking to constituents, she\u2019s heard \u201clots of personal stories of loss.\u201d \u201cAlmost no matter where I go, I get pulled aside by somebody,\u201d she said, adding that because of her floor speech, \u201cwomen felt like someone was kind of voicing their story in a way and really could understand and relate to the pain or the difficulties.\u201d Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law last year a 24-week abortion ban that also mandates ultrasounds prior to the procedure. The law went into effect in January. State Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, running for reelection State Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka was 24 weeks pregnant as the Granite State legislature debated the 24-week abortion ban legislation. Moved by how such a ban could potentially affect her, she gave a floor speech, urging her colleagues to oppose the bill. \u201cMy rights actually were being changed by the legislation we were debating,\u201d Perkins Kwoka said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think my colleagues thought it would really apply to a woman like me who was sitting in the chamber.\u201d \u201cIt particularly felt like, today, I\u2019m a mom, and I\u2019m a woman, and I\u2019m capable of all of these complex decisions. What\u2019s different after week 24? Why tomorrow, you know? Am I capable of different decisions?\u201d she said. \u201cThose were some of the thoughts that I had as we had this floor debate.\u201d Perkins Kwoka, who is running for reelection this year, said abortion rights have \u201ccertainly been something that the constituents are paying attention to.\u201d \u201cI have had women stop me in parking lots, talk to me in line when I\u2019m getting coffee, send me emails, send me text messages that are like, \u2018Thank you for fighting for us on choice.\u2019 Women in my mom\u2019s generation are saying I cannot believe that you still need to be fighting this fight on our behalf, but thank you for doing it,\u201d she said. In Pennsylvania, the Republican-led state legislature has passed anti-abortion bills, but Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has used his veto pen to block the legislation. Abortion rights advocates worry that with Wolf term-limited this year, those restrictive abortion bills could become law without a Democrat in the governor\u2019s mansion. State Attorney General Josh Shapiro, running for governor Josh Shapiro, the lone Democrat running to succeed Wolf, has been outspoken against the anti-abortion laws in Texas, Mississippi and South Carolina. As state attorney general, he joined legal challenges to these laws, arguing they were unconstitutional. Shapiro also previously challenged a Trump administration gag rule that barred funding for abortion clinics. \u201cThroughout my career, I have always fought to protect reproductive rights \u2013 and as Governor, I will stand up to any attempt to further restrict the right to choose in Pennsylvania,\u201d Shapiro told CNN in a statement. \u201cRepublicans are leading a concerted effort to ban abortion across the country, and who we elect as our next governor will quite literally decide whether women\u2019s reproductive freedoms continue to exist in Pennsylvania,\u201d he said. Alexandra Hunt, running for the US House of Representatives Alexandra Hunt, a 29-year-old public health researcher challenging Rep. Dwight Evans in the Democratic primary for Pennsylvania\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, has spoken of her personal experience with abortion. \u201cI think living the experience is really important,\u201d Hunt, who had an abortion when she was 18 years old, told CNN. At the time of her abortion, Hunt said she was a freshman in college and \u201cnot in any sort of financial position to raise a child.\u201d \u201cI was working in restaurants, going to school and I was working in strip clubs. And I could not bring a child into this world and care for that child properly,\u201d she said, describing her decision as \u201cmotivated by love for the future children I do want to bring into this world.\u201d Hunt believes Congress must codify Roe v. Wade into law. \u201cThere is a very distinct disconnect between policymakers and the people that have to abide by the policy,\u201d she said. \u201cI would help to bridge that gap.\u201d Michigan is another state where a Democratic governor \u2013 in this case, Gretchen Whitmer \u2013 has vetoed anti-abortion bills passed by the GOP-controlled state legislature. It is also one of nine states with an abortion ban on the books \u2013 Michigan\u2019s dates to 1931 \u2013 that could potentially be enforced if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, running for reelection Whitmer filed a lawsuit on April 7 against several county prosecutors in Michigan and asked the state\u2019s Supreme Court to issue a decision on the constitutionality of abortion. The lawsuit is the most recent example of Whitmer\u2019s efforts to defend abortion access in her state. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we will learn if the US Supreme Court decides to overturn Roe v. Wade. \u2026 If Roe is overturned, abortion could become illegal in Michigan in nearly any circumstance \u2013 including in cases of rape and incest \u2013 and deprive Michigan women of the ability to make critical health care decisions for themselves,\u201d Whitmer said in a statement. \u201cThis is no longer theoretical: it is reality.\u201d Whitmer previously vetoed legislation that would provide more than $16 million in anti-abortion funding in Michigan and has asked the state legislature to pass a bill repealing the state\u2019s 1931 abortion ban, which she described in an interview with CNN+\u2019s Kasie Hunt as \u201cone of the most extreme laws on the books.\u201d State Attorney General Dana Nessel, running for reelection Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has said that she would not use resources of her office to defend Michigan\u2019s 1931 abortion ban, even if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Earlier this month, Nessel, for the first time, described having her own abortion in 2002 while pregnant with triplets. At the time, Nessel had to terminate one of the pregnancies in order to carry the other two to term. \u201cI\u2019ve made it very clear that if you are a medically qualified person to provide an abortion, I don\u2019t intend to use the resources of my department to prosecute women or their doctors for what is a private and personal decision, and a medical decision, made between those parties,\u201d she told CNN last month. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we\u2019re protecting them by subjecting them to great bodily harm or death because you have physicians that are so afraid of preforming what\u2019s been a routine procedure,\u201d she said. Nessel said she urges women who fear a potential loss of abortion rights to exercise their right to vote. \u201cWhat I tell women is like, \u2018If you\u2019re scared, good. You should be scared. But you should be activated, and you should get involved, support candidates who are pro-choice and who believe in the right to privacy,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAll is not lost.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There\u2019s just not much President Joe Biden can do about it. There\u2019s not much he can do to curb inflation. There\u2019s not much he can do to stop migrants from reaching America\u2019s southern border. Or to reduce crime, or to make vaccine resisters get shots that would hasten the end of the coronavirus pandemic. There\u2019s not much he can do to compel cooperation from defectors within his thin Democratic congressional majorities. There is nothing at all he can do to compel it from Republican adversaries who would rather aggravate than alleviate his burdens. In other words, there\u2019s not much Biden can do about the heaviest weights depressing his political standing, which has remained stuck in the avalanche-warning zone for months. So his party faces the likelihood of a substantial November election defeat that hands the House and perhaps the Senate to the GOP. Biden and his aides will spend the next seven months trying just the same, using the White House bully pulpit, executive authority and international diplomacy. Marginal benefits represent the best they can hope for. Booming job growth is a double-edged sword for Joe Biden It recalls the 1960s-era lament of a beleaguered President Lyndon B. Johnson, who complained that \u201cthe only power I\u2019ve got is nuclear, and I can\u2019t even use that.\u201d That applies literally to Biden\u2019s predicament on Ukraine, where the risk of catastrophic escalation precludes direct intervention by America\u2019s military to halt Russian aggression. Frustrated fellow Democrats insist the administration can get politically healthier with better \u201cmessaging.\u201d That might sound persuasive had the President\u2019s party not lost House seats in 26 of the last 29 midterm elections over more than a century. Biden\u2019s four most recent predecessors, with varying communications acumen, all lost control of one or both chambers of Congress in midterms. Opportunistic Republicans say Biden needs to shift ideological directions. They fault his policies \u2013 \u201cradical,\u201d \u201cfar left,\u201d \u201csocialist\u201d or worse \u2013 for creating the conditions turning voters against him. Inflation provides their strongest evidence. Liberal and conservative economists share a growing consensus that Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan last year pumped too much money into economy. That money accelerated the economic recovery and helped restore millions of jobs. But by supercharging consumer demand, it also worsened inflationary pressures already building in the US and around the world as the economy emerged from Covid-19 shutdowns. Amazon is adding a 5% fuel and inflation surcharge Yet the White House can\u2019t fundamentally alter that reality now. Efforts to smooth gnarled supply chains, use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to expand oil supplies or waive air pollution regulations to produce more fuel with less gas can modestly offset rising prices. Events abroad, from new Covid shutdowns in China to developments in the war, can swamp them in a flash. Outside voices, such as the eminent Democratic economist Larry Summers, prescribe more potent options such as lifting tariffs on Chinese imports, shelving \u201cbuy America\u201d requirements that limit competition in government purchasing and expanding immigration to loosen a tight labor market. Each of those options, however, carries toxic political side effects. Other issues have made Biden the victim of circumstances, as presidents often find. Illegal immigration \u2013 which has paralyzed Congress and bedeviled chief executives for decades \u2013 presents the quintessential no-win problem. Even before he took office, Republicans blamed Biden for a \u201cborder crisis\u201d over migrant flows that began increasing in 2020 under President Donald Trump. To the extent that further increases resulted simply from trading Trump\u2019s harsh-on-immigrants profile for Biden\u2019s more congenial one, the incumbent can\u2019t change that. To the chagrin of core supporters, Biden has made only incremental immigration policy changes. Now, as the administration prepares to lift Covid restrictions on the border that health conditions no longer justify, electorally vulnerable Democrats have joined the pile-on from the right. Biden announces new gun regulation and names ATF nominee The frightening upsurge in murders also began in the 2020 pandemic year before his presidency, for reasons criminologists will debate for decades. So did the spike in fentanyl deaths. Tougher firearms regulations from Washington \u2013 such as last week\u2019s executive action on \u201cghost guns,\u201d Biden\u2019s substitute for congressional inaction \u2013 can\u2019t change much on American streets. Nor can the President\u2019s rejection of \u201cdefund\u201d movements targeting local police departments, as the early struggles of New York City Mayor Eric Adams make clear. Biden could receive political help from others. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia could finally deliver the decisive vote for parts of the President\u2019s stalled economic agenda. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates skillfully enough to calm voters\u2019 inflation fears without precipitating a recession. The Supreme Court, by discarding the constitutional right to abortion, could jump-start mobilization of Democratic voters. An increasingly radicalized GOP could nominate unelectable candidates in pivotal Senate races. Democratic candidates this fall could use campaign attacks to generate the sharp national contrast that presidents typically use to recover from midterm setbacks in their own reelection years. Trump\u2019s aberrant behavior, culminating in the deadly January 6 insurrection against American democracy, presents a unique political target. But history shows presidents can rarely change the political weather in midterm elections. Though the specific meteorological conditions change, the weather is nearly always bad. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell observed last week that the Democratic-controlled White House and Congress had hit a \u201cperfect storm of problems.\u201d Every available gauge indicates he\u2019s right.",

            "article_content": "A fresh tide of extreme populism \u2013 feeding on economic strain, hostility to immigrants and cultural warfare \u2013 is challenging key democracies from the inside at the same time Russia escalates the most brutal assault on the liberal Western order in decades. In France, the United States, Hungary and elsewhere, the center seems to be dropping out of politics as moderates lose ground to radicals on the right and the left, amid widespread public discontent after a two-year pandemic that saw governments significantly curtail individual freedoms. Only 17 months ago, a US campaign won by a veteran establishment politician \u2013 President Joe Biden \u2013 who had campaigned as a moderate against a wannabe authoritarian \u2013 Donald Trump \u2013 appeared to herald the end of the road for the former commander in chief\u2019s populist crusade. Yet Republicans, still in thrall to Trump \u2013 many of whom have signed on to his corrosive lies about election fraud to win the favor of his supporters \u2013 appear on course to capture the House, and perhaps the Senate, in midterm elections in the fall. They are capitalizing on deep frustrations around the country over rising prices and high gasoline costs that Biden has been unable to stem. Many are also staking out fiery messages on racial, gender and LGBTQ issues and immigration, implying that traditional American culture is at risk of being destroyed. That theme dominated the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. In France, President Emmanuel Macron \u2013 the epitome of technocratic elitism \u2013 now faces a tough two-week fight to beat back the momentum of the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam and pro-Putin far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The pro-Trump wing of European politics racked up one victory that would have pleased Russian President Vladimir Putin after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban \u2013 a scourge of press freedom, EU leaders and democratic values \u2013 kept his job in a landslide election win earlier this month. Orban, a favorite of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement and conservative TV pundits, profited from his own gerrymandering of electoral districts and friendly propagandists in the press to defy predictions that his appeal was fading. Trump\u2019s continued hold on Republican politics, Orban\u2019s victory and Macron\u2019s tight reelection race underscore how the established structures of democracy in Western nations remain vulnerable \u2013 not just from hostile outside forces like Putin\u2019s election meddling but also from a perception that traditional politicians are unable to solve people\u2019s problems. The worst predictions of Macron\u2019s performance in the first round of the election didn\u2019t materialize as he won by about 5 percentage points. But his lackluster campaign gave Le Pen an opening to brand the President, who has always struggled to show he understands voters\u2019 economic difficulties, as indifferent to high inflation and energy prices. As he trained his sights on the second round of his election race, Macron styled himself as a bulwark against populism and extremism inside France and abroad. \u201cI want France to be part of a strong EU, continuing to create alliances with the great democracies of the world to protect ourselves,\u201d the French President said after the first-round result. \u201cI do not want a France that leaves the EU and only has international populists and xenophobes as allies. That is not us.\u201d After the effective disappearance of the center-right opposition in French politics, around 50% of the vote went to radical parties of the right and left. In some ways, this parallels the eclipse of moderate Republicans in Washington by Trump\u2019s authoritarian America First-ism. In the US, Biden won in 2020 by courting the moderate suburbs, but progressives succeeded in tugging his presidency to the left once he was in office in a way that may have alienated more centrist voters. Le Pen has worked to paper over her past support for Putin and her vows to pull France out of the European Union. But if she were to pull off a surprise victory, the anti-Putin coalition in Europe would come under severe strain, and the Russian leader would have a fresh opportunity to carve new divides among the allies. Macron has been especially prominent in the Ukraine crisis, keeping open lines of communication with the Kremlin but also emerging as Biden\u2019s most important ally in Europe. \u201cPutin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine strengthened the West as never before since the Cold War. The world is now divided between those countries that defend the rule of law and democracy and those that fight to end them,\u201d said Nicholas Dungan, an Atlantic Council senior fellow who teaches at Sciences Po, a prestigious French research university. Still, Macron\u2019s first-round victory and newly energized rhetoric offered the prospect that he could be a dam against extremism, at least in France. \u201cToday we have some minor relief that we will be able to count on French leadership in the future,\u201d Dungan said after Sunday\u2019s results in an election that had been watched with some anxiety among Biden administration officials. Still, no one who worries about the threat that extremism poses to democracy \u2013 a core theme of Biden\u2019s presidency \u2013 is taking a second-round Macron victory for granted. \u201cThe far right has never been so close to winning,\u201d said defeated French Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse. In 2016, the populist revolt that saw Britain vote to leave the European Union was a canary-in-the-coal-mine moment that foreshadowed Trump\u2019s outsider crusade that crushed Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s White House hopes. Six years later, there appear to be ill omens for Democrats across the English Channel. Le Pen was able to energize her campaign, holding multiple rallies in rural areas, by highlighting the punishing toll of inflation that pushed up the cost of living and was exacerbated by the economic impact of the war in Ukraine. Biden, who repeatedly told Americans that inflation was a \u201ctransitory\u201d issue coming out of the pandemic, has tried hard to show the country he understands its effects. But he could pay a heavy price in November\u2019s midterms if already disgruntled voters are still furious about their grocery bills. Trump, Le Pen and Orban don\u2019t come anywhere near the depravity and violence of Putin, who is perpetrating atrocities in Ukraine on a scale not seen since at least the Bosnian war and probably since World War II. But the tactics of many of the anti-establishment politicians stem from a similar well of political toxicity. They rely on whipping up anger over economic conditions into resentment of foreigners, Muslims and outsiders, including other minority communities. Some concentrate on eroding the reputation of democratic systems and a free press to build power. Anything that increases the cynicism of the electorate about its rulers and the system that keeps them in place creates a new pool of anger that can be exploited. Voter suppression eroded democracy in Russia and Hungary, and it\u2019s doing the same in the US. It\u2019s not certain that Trump\u2019s extremism will provide a path to power among a diverse general electorate. But he remains the dominant figure in his party and the front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. Trump\u2019s entire political project \u2013 one that incited an unprecedented assault on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 \u2013 is now based on a big lie: that the US election was rigged in 2020. The more outrageous the lie, the more it can be weaponized for a politician\u2019s nefarious means. Putin\u2019s rationale for invading Ukraine \u2013 that the country is under the grip of Nazis, when in reality it has a democratically elected, Jewish President \u2013 springs from the same well of dangerous fantasy politics. The onslaught was motivated by Putin\u2019s belief that the country did not have the right to exist as an independent, sovereign state and that its people were essentially Russians. But it was also brewed from more than 30 years of the Russian leader\u2019s festering resentment of the West and its political systems following the fall of the Soviet Union after the Cold War. The Russian President launched his own direct effort to disrupt US democracy with his intervention in the 2016 election in the United States, which US intelligence agencies assessed was designed to help Trump win. Those same agencies warned on Monday that US pressure on Russia over the Ukraine invasion could prompt Putin to go even further in meddling in US democracy in the future. But it was Ukraine\u2019s open desire to solidify its democracy by joining the West \u2013 it wanted membership in the European Union and NATO \u2013 that finally pushed Putin over the edge and precipitated his onslaught.",

            "article_content": "Nearly all the Republicans vying for the party\u2019s Senate nomination in Ohio are embracing former President Donald Trump\u2019s message, touting their closeness to him and cozying up to the elements of the GOP that he propelled as they joust for a late endorsement. All that\u2019s missing is Trump himself. The former President has not given his stamp of approval to any candidate in the race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. An endorsement \u2013 if one comes \u2013 could prove decisive in a contest in which polls have shown all the leading candidates under 30% and a huge swath of undecided primary voters. \u201cThere are people up on the stage who are literally fighting for one vote, and that person doesn\u2019t even vote in Ohio,\u201d state Sen. Matt Dolan, the only one of seven Republican candidates who has not embraced Trump\u2019s lies about widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, said at a recent debate in Wilberforce. Trump remains undecided on whether he should endorse in Ohio's crowded GOP Senate primary The jockeying for a late, game-changing endorsement from Trump comes in part because polls show the primary is wide open with less than four weeks remaining before the May 3 primary, and with early voting having kicked off this week. Appeals to voters still loyal to the former President are on display in debates and candidates\u2019 television ads. Venture capitalist and author J.D. Vance has aligned himself with far-right figures who emerged in Trump\u2019s wake. He defended Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently spoke at a White nationalist gathering, saying in Wilberforce that he listened to her speech and \u201cagreed with nearly every word that she said.\u201d \u201cShe said nothing wrong, and I\u2019m absolutely not going to throw her under the bus, or anybody else who\u2019s a friend of mine,\u201d Vance said. Former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken has frequently equated being hand-picked for that party job by Trump to an effective endorsement for this race. She has hired two of Trump\u2019s former top political allies, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie. Self-funding financier Mike Gibbons and former state Treasurer Josh Mandel have also courted Trump aggressively. Gibbons has cast himself as a candidate in Trump\u2019s mold \u2013 a former businessman with no real political background, and experience making money in systems that he\u2019d now like to overhaul. Mandel has focused on Gibbons\u2019 business experience, accusing him at a debate in Cleveland last month of \u201cmaking millions\u201d on stock in a Chinese company. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been in the private sector in your entire life. You don\u2019t know squat,\u201d Gibbons said. 'Back off, buddy': Two candidates get in each other's faces during Ohio GOP Senate debate \u201cTwo tours in Iraq,\u201d Mandel, who served in the Marine Corps Reserve, shot back, as he stood up and approached Gibbons and the two stood face to face. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I haven\u2019t worked.\u201d It\u2019s all unfolding without Trump weighing in publicly on the race. The former President has waded into other competitive Senate primaries, including in neighboring Pennsylvania, where he endorsed celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz\u2019s campaign on Saturday. Mandel and Gibbons have led the pack in most polls. But Timken and Vance also have some support, and all four have flooded the airwaves with ads. Dolan, meanwhile, is attempting to tap into the concerns of some Republicans that the race to appease Trump and court his most ardent supporters in the primary could ultimately damage the GOP\u2019s chances of holding on to the seat in November. Ohio in recent elections appears to have shed its former bellwether status as Republicans\u2019 dominance among White working-class and rural voters has shifted the Midwestern state out of reach for most Democrats in statewide elections. Some, though, continue to succeed there. Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown won reelection in 2018, coasting to a 7-point victory as Republicans swept every statewide executive race. And Democrats have won a handful of statewide judicial races too. The likely Democratic nominee in this year\u2019s Senate race, longtime US Rep. Tim Ryan \u2013 who challenged Nancy Pelosi for the House speaker\u2019s gavel in 2016 and briefly ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 is offering himself as an \u201call economy all the time\u201d candidate in Brown\u2019s mold. He has eschewed the culture wars on the campaign trail, instead delivering populist missives against China and international trade deals. Still, for a Democrat to win in Ohio, large swaths of independents and Republicans would need to find the GOP nominee unacceptable. Why Democrats are desperate to prove Ohio isn't a lost cause That prospect is the nightmare of national Republicans, who are watching as similar potential scenarios loom across the Senate playing field \u2013 including in reliably red Missouri, where a leading candidate is accused of assault by his ex-wife; in Georgia, where a Trump-endorsed former football star has faced allegations of threatening multiple women, including his ex-wife; and in Pennsylvania, where the nation\u2019s most expensive Senate primary could leave the eventual winner bloodied. With control of a Senate that\u2019s now split 50-50 on the line, losses in any combination of those states could imperil Republicans\u2019 hopes in what should otherwise be a good midterm for the party in the current political environment. In Ohio, Democratic strategists privately say the Republican who would be toughest to beat in November is the one they\u2019re most certain GOP primary voters won\u2019t nominate: Dolan. Democrats see the state senator, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, in the mold of Portman, who has held the seat since 2011. Unlike rivals, including Mandel, who say the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, Dolan has acknowledged the reality of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cLet me be very clear, Joe Biden is the legitimate president of the United States,\u201d Dolan said at the debate in Wilberforce. \u201cMy problem is he\u2019s a failed president.\u201d The television ad battles have also seen GOP candidates making cultural arguments \u2013 with Mandel and Vance both launching spots in recent days that attempt to tap into conservative frustrations over their positions being labeled as \u201cracist.\u201d \u201cAre you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans?\u201d Vance says in an ad that touts his support for Trump\u2019s border wall. Vance uses the ad to highlight his mother\u2019s struggle with addiction, arguing that a tough stance on immigration is an important step in battling the opioid epidemic. Mandel, meanwhile, says in a new ad that describes him as \u201cpro-Trump\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t do two tours in Anbar province, fighting alongside Marines of every color, to come home and be called a racist. There\u2019s nothing racist about stopping critical race theory and loving America.\u201d But the scenery in the ad also ignited controversy. The 30-second spot features Mandel standing on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, the landmark site where peaceful civil rights activists were beaten by police during a 1965 march. \u201cMartin Luther King marched right here so skin color wouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d Mandel says. He also tweeted a thanks to King\u2019s daughter Bernice King and The King Center \u201cfor motivating me to film this ad. My visit to Selma was powerful and inspiring and I look forward to returning and bringing my kids.\u201d That led Bernice King to respond on Twitter, saying: \u201cJosh: Regretfully, I do not believe that I or @TheKingCenter legitimately motivated you to film this ad, as it is in opposition to nonviolence and to much of what my father taught. I encourage you to study my father/nonviolence in full.\u201d Mandel responded by telling King to \u201cstudy your history better.\u201d \u201cYour father knew the importance of the Second Amendment when he tried to exercise his right to self-defense,\u201d he said, \u201cand was wrongly denied a gun permit by anti-gun racists.\u201d Wealthy candidates pour millions into 2022 campaigns Portman has endorsed Timken, who nevertheless frequently reminds audiences that she\u2019s been endorsed by Trump before. Timken\u2019s decision to hire Trump 2016 primary campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was another step into Trump\u2019s orbit. And though Lewandowski is a controversial figure, most of the other candidates in the GOP race have not criticized her decision to hire him. \u201cLong story short, he was there at the beginning for President Trump,\u201d Mandel said of Lewandowski at the Wilberforce debate \u2013 a comment that also underscored Mandel\u2019s seeming belief that his only viable rival is Gibbons. Only Dolan, in another debate this week, raised the issue of Lewandowski\u2019s hiring, saying that Timken \u201chasn\u2019t yet explained\u201d to voters why she hired Lewandowski, \u201cwho has been investigated for assault to women.\u201d \u201cCorey Lewandowski is a friend of mine,\u201d Timken responded. \u201cHe knows that I\u2019ve been in the trenches fighting for America First policies because Corey came into Ohio and campaigned for President Trump with me.\u201d This headline and story have been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has raised more than $100 million for his reelection effort, the first gubernatorial candidate in the Sunshine State \u2013 and perhaps the entire country \u2013 to reach the nine-figure milestone solely through donations. The staggering sum not only gives DeSantis an unprecedented leg up on the Democrats attempting to unseat him this November, it also sends an indisputable message to the potential field of 2024 Republican presidential hopefuls that there is already a promising contender with deep support from major donors and grassroots voters alike. It\u2019s the kind of fundraising chops that \u201ccatapults him into the top tier of potential GOP candidates,\u201d said Scott Reed, a veteran GOP operative and former top strategist for the US Chamber of Commerce. \u201cHe\u2019s been asking for big licks \u2013 $5 million and $10 million per fundraiser \u2013 and he\u2019s getting them and that\u2019s a warning sign,\u201d Reed said. \u201cDeSantis is the talk of every Republican cocktail party and every organizational meeting. His support spans the money class and the movement conservatives. And that\u2019s a strong combination early in the game.\u201d The latest fundraising numbers for DeSantis won\u2019t become official until Monday, the state\u2019s deadline to report March totals. However, a CNN review of contributions posted to the website of his political committee, Friends of Ron DeSantis, showed a March haul of $6.1 million. His campaign and political committee, which are separate entities both working toward his reelection, had previously reported raising a combined $96 million this cycle through February. While the proliferation of political committees and differences in campaign finance laws makes it difficult to compare fundraising numbers across state boundaries, it appears DeSantis is the first candidate in any state to eclipse $100 million entirely on donations. According to data maintained by the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets, the two past gubernatorial candidates who amassed $100 million campaigns \u2013 former business executive and 2010 GOP nominee for California governor Meg Whitman and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, whose family owns Hyatt Hotels \u2013 funded their campaigns almost entirely with their own money. DeSantis, though, is not independently wealthy. Prior to becoming governor in 2019, DeSantis served less than three terms in Congress. Before that, he was a lawyer in the Navy. His net worth is $348,000, according to his most recent financial disclosure form. Instead, DeSantis has broken fundraising records by relying on a mix of sources. He has received significant contributions from the state and national parties and has crisscrossed the country to raise money from wealthy GOP donors. His political committee has collected large checks from influential Florida businesses and small donations from all 50 states. DeSantis vs. Disney showdown bolsters Florida governor's standing in GOP DeSantis has also tapped into former President Donald Trump\u2019s donor network, including Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, WeatherTech CEO David MacNeil and shipping magnate Richard Uihlein and his wife, Elizabeth. All have given six-figure sums to DeSantis\u2019 political committee. Because the money was raised for a state race, it is unlikely it can be used to assist DeSantis in a federal campaign, should he run in the future. But former President George W. Bush demonstrated how a relentless fundraising blitz in a state race can boost a prospective presidential bid. Like DeSantis, Bush in 1998 was a Republican incumbent widely seen as a serious contender for the next presidential race. Bush signaled he would be a formidable candidate for the White House by putting up gaudy fundraising numbers en route to a historic margin of victory in the Lonestar State. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people raise that kind of money before. It doesn\u2019t always mean success,\u201d said Charlie Black, who worked on Bush\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cBush was successful with that strategy. The biggest thing DeSantis has to do is keep his eye on the ball and make sure he gets reelected.\u201d Other potential 2024 contenders are noticing DeSantis\u2019 fundraising prowess \u2013 including Trump. The former President has closely monitored which former donors have opened up their checkbooks to the Florida governor, people close to Trump previously told CNN. DeSantis' rising star -- and fraught relationship with Trump -- on display as CPAC kicks off in Florida Trump reiterated to The Washington Post this week his belief that he \u201cmade\u201d DeSantis when he endorsed the underfunded and lesser-known congressman in the 2018 GOP primary for Florida governor. He added that he doesn\u2019t believe DeSantis \u2013 or any other ally \u2013 will run in 2024 if the former President is in the race. \u201cIf I ran, I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d want to run,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSome out of loyalty would have had a hard time running.\u201d One adviser to a potential presidential candidate acknowledged that important Republican donors likely see in DeSantis \u201can opportunity to get in on the ground floor\u201d of a future presidential campaign \u2013 one featuring the only candidate who comes close to rivaling Trump\u2019s support in early 2024 polling. But the adviser added that there is more for DeSantis to prove than being a successful fundraiser. \u201cDespite all the attention he\u2019s getting, DeSantis is largely untested,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cWhen you look at the potential 2024 field, he stands out as the person who has never faced a monumental challenge and that\u2019s bound to happen over the next year and a half. It\u2019s going to be a pivotal moment for him.\u201d Other 2024 hopefuls may have to tiptoe around Trump and raise money through political action committees with vague mission statements about helping elect Republicans. But as a candidate running for reelection in a high-profile state, DeSantis doesn\u2019t have to make excuses to have an audience with big-name Republican donors. The list of donors to his gubernatorial campaign is a who\u2019s who of the GOP money class: businessman John Childs, hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, ex-private equity financier and former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, San Francisco Giants owner Charles Johnson and beef jerky mogul Troy Link, among others. It\u2019s a mix of past backers to presidential campaigns, Trump allies and some people, such as hedge fund manager Ken Griffin and Interactive Brokers Group chairman Thomas Peterffy, who are looking beyond Trump in 2024. Peterffy told Bloomberg News last year that he would prefer to see DeSantis as the Republican presidential nominee in 2024 because he is less impulsive than Trump. Griffin ruled out backing Trump if he runs again. Ron DeSantis follows the Trump playbook ahead of 2024 Rob Stutzman, a California-based GOP consultant, said DeSantis\u2019 fundraising to date \u201ccertainly confirms conventional wisdom that he is the non-Trump front-runner for the nomination.\u201d \u201cDemonstrating that kind of fundraising network is what other candidates will notice as they assess whether to enter the field to compete against him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be an issue that continues to engender Donald Trump\u2019s jealousy, too.\u201d Nick Iarossi, a lobbyist and top DeSantis fundraiser, said the governor\u2019s support among donors grew during the coronavirus pandemic, when he bucked medical experts and lifted restrictions on businesses and schools before most other states. He\u2019s picked up more support as he\u2019s become a frequent foil for President Joe Biden, often challenging White House policies on coronavirus mitigation measures, vaccines and immigration. \u201cIt makes him a formidable national contender for sure,\u201d Iarossi said of DeSantis\u2019 growing fundraising network. \u201cBut I also think there\u2019s a bigger message and one the governor hopes the people in the party see and that is doing what you say you\u2019re going to do and being unapologetic about it is going to lead to support.\u201d DeSantis has another advantage fueling his record-breaking fundraising push: Florida campaign finance laws do not limit contributions to political committees. As it is, deep-pocketed Republican donors from across the country and prominent Florida corporations have cut five- and six-figure checks to directly support DeSantis\u2019 reelection effort. Griffin contributed $5 million in a single donation. The Republican Governors Association has put in more than $10 million. It\u2019s an edge also shared by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, another potential 2024 GOP contender first facing a reelection fight this year. Abbott raised $93 million through February 19 for his race against Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, according to OpenSecrets. Pete Quist, the deputy research director at OpenSecrets, has studied gubernatorial fundraising data for years. He said incumbents benefit when there are no contribution limits \u201cbecause they get money from interests and the checks come in earlier and they come in larger.\u201d Fact check: Emails show one of DeSantis' stories backing the rationale for so-called 'Don't Say Gay' law didn't happen as the governor says DeSantis ran for governor in 2018 as the antidote to a state government that he portrayed as overrun by lobbyists and corporate money. DeSantis\u2019 campaign called his Republican primary opponent, establishment favorite Adam Putnam, a shill for \u201cspecial interest money\u201d and a \u201cswamp dweller.\u201d Borrowing a line from Trump, DeSantis promised to \u201cdrain the swamp in Tallahassee that needs to be drained just like Washington.\u201d Since getting elected, though, DeSantis\u2019 political ambitions have benefited from the largesse of some of Florida\u2019s most powerful and politically connected entities. His political committee has raised nearly $3 million from the same companies and industry-affiliated political committees that donated more than $150,000 to Putnam, including Disney, utility companies and a PAC run by state Realtors. DeSantis\u2019 campaign declined to comment for this story. Florida, with its diverse and disparate communities spread across a half dozen major television markets, is a notoriously costly state to mount a campaign. Candidates are expected to raise fistfuls of cash or pony up from their own pocketbooks to be competitive in statewide races. But even by Florida standards, DeSantis has become an outlier. He has already surpassed the record $88 million raised during the 2014 election cycle by his predecessor, now-Sen. Rick Scott, a former health care executive who helped finance his own campaign. DeSantis is on pace to soon eclipse the $113 million he and his 2018 opponent, Democrat Andrew Gillum, combined to raise in their costly, tight race for governor. And there are still seven months until Election Day. Meanwhile, the Democrats attempting to defeat DeSantis are still finding their footing. Through February, US Rep. Charlie Crist, a onetime governor as a Republican and the Democratic nominee for governor in 2014, had raised $7.1 million with $4.7 million still on hand. State Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried had about $3.6 million left of the $6 million she reported raising through February, while a third candidate, state Sen. Annette Taddeo, had raised less than $1 million. The primary election is August 23. Florida was once the perennial swing state. 2022 may prove how red it has become The Florida Democratic Party did not respond to questions about its plan to compete with DeSantis\u2019 fundraising advantage. Steve Schale, a Democratic campaign consultant, expects money to flood into Florida once the party has a nominee, but DeSantis, he said, \u201cis still going to outspend, even in the rosiest scenarios on my side.\u201d The gap in resources will allow DeSantis to \u201ccompletely dictate the terms of the conversation\u201d throughout the campaign, Schale added. \u201cWhen you\u2019re underfunded, you have to constantly make bad choices,\u201d said Schale, who was involved in past gubernatorial campaigns. \u201cYou\u2019re choosing between cutting off your right arm or your left arm and hoping you don\u2019t bleed to death.\u201d Perhaps most daunting for Democrats is how much cash DeSantis is still sitting on. His campaign had $88.5 million on hand through February. One longtime Tallahassee-based Republican adviser said the joke around the capital is that the DeSantis campaign team is the \u201cpoorest group of rich people in the state.\u201d Not unlike Trump, DeSantis has a reputation for scrutinizing every dollar spent by his campaign. Despite his growing political profile, DeSantis didn\u2019t have campaign staff until relatively recently, and it remains a pretty slim operation. \u201cEventually, those resources will be deployed,\u201d Iarossi said. \u201cHe\u2019s frugal. That\u2019s his reputation. And that\u2019s part of the reason people feel good giving to him.\u201d Last year, the second-largest expense for DeSantis\u2019 political committee was $560,000 spent on inventory for campaign merchandise. That\u2019s not typical for a campaign with this kind of cash flow. But DeSantis has generated several rounds of headlines \u2013 known in the political world as earned media \u2013 by pushing out provocative campaign swag, like \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci My Florida\u201d koozies and \u201cFauci Can Pound Sand\u201d flip flops \u2013 after chief Biden medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2013 and a sleeve of two golf balls that says \u201cFlorida\u2019s Governor Has a Pair.\u201d \u201cMost of those, like the flip flops, he comes up with the ideas,\u201d Iarossi said. \u201cHe\u2019s reviewing budgets and new hires and how much is being paid. He does not want to waste campaign dollars. He\u2019s very particular.\u201d CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to note that hedge fund manager Ken Griffin did not previously back former President Donald Trump.

            "article_content": "Polls have closed in California\u2019s 22nd Congressional District where voters cast their ballots in the special election to replace Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who resigned in January to head the Trump Media & Technology Group. Six contenders were vying to fill the vacant seat in a district covering portions of Fresno and Tulare counties from Clovis to areas south of Visalia. But the winner may only end up serving in Congress for a few months after the district was sliced into pieces by the state\u2019s non-partisan redistricting commission. It will cease to exist in its current form when the new Congress is sworn in next year. Nunes\u2019 loyalty to former President Donald Trump made him a polarizing figure in California and nationally. But the race to replace him among four Republicans and two Democrats \u2013 most of whom are not well-known \u2013 has been relatively congenial, focusing largely on local issues like drought and the struggle to get more water to farmers in the Central Valley. As of Monday, less than 16% of the mail ballots that were sent to each voter eligible to vote in Fresno County \u2013 about 40,657 ballots \u2013 had been returned by the 258,752 voters who were eligible to participate. Less than 14% of the mail ballots sent to the 156,269 eligible voters in Tulare County had been returned as of Monday, according to county officials. All registered voters in the district were sent a mail-in ballot. Analysis: Truth Social looks like an absolute bust so far Tuesday\u2019s election was the first step toward filling the district\u2019s vacancy, under its current lines, through the end of the year. June\u2019s California primary and November\u2019s general election will be held under the new lines drawn by California\u2019s redistricting commission, with the winner taking office in 2023 for a regular two-year term. Under the new maps, much of Nunes\u2019 old district will become part of the new 21st District, anchored by Fresno, where veteran Democratic Rep. Jim Costa is the front-runner in what is considered a safe seat for his party. A roadmap to the 2022 midterm elections Under California\u2019s top-two primary system, county officials will determine whether any candidate has received the majority of the votes (50% plus 1). If not, the top-two finishers, regardless of party, will proceed to a runoff on June 7, when California holds its statewide primary election. A runoff could produce even more confusion, because the names of one or more of the special election candidates could appear twice on the June ballot if they\u2019re competing for a second office. The brevity of the potential assignment in Washington created a split among the candidates between those who say they\u2019re only interested in this seat and those who are simultaneously seeking another congressional office for the term that begins in 2023. Republican Connie Conway, who has the most name recognition in the field as a former minority leader in the state Assembly and a former Tulare County supervisor, argued voters should support her because she would serve in a \u201ccaretaker\u201d role and not use the office as a \u201cstepping stone\u201d to another congressional office. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of district work that I really want to see happen until the very end; I think that\u2019s very important,\u201d Conway told CNN, noting the troubleshooting role congressional offices play on everything from passport delays to problems with Social Security benefits. Conway said she has built relationships with most members of the California delegation on both sides of the aisle. \u201cI think I\u2019m the right person at the right time to finish the job.\u201d Others like Republicans Matt Stoll and Michael Maher, as well as Democrat Eric Garcia, viewed the Nunes seat as a starting point as they vie to represent the new 21st District, where they will face Costa. Stoll, a retired Navy fighter pilot who has said he wants to be a part of a \u201cred tsunami\u201d in November, told CNN he is trying to build momentum in the special election as \u201ca springboard\u201d for the contest in the 21st District. He described the remaining months of Nunes\u2019 term as a time when he could build alliances with like-minded members \u201cto roll back every aspect of the progressive agenda and what Joe Biden stands for.\u201d He listed examples that ranged from school curriculum that he says is intended to \u201cindoctrinate our children in socialist ways,\u201d to environmental lawsuits in the Central Valley that have limited the flow of water for farmers, to limits on domestic oil drilling, which he says have thwarted America\u2019s potential for \u201cglobal energy dominance.\u201d At the other end of the ideological spectrum, Garcia argued that if Democrats can gain control of Nunes\u2019 seat, it would serve as an important symbolic victory for the residents of the San Joaquin Valley, who have been \u201csuffering in silence\u201d from the region\u2019s decades-long challenges with poverty, air pollution and contaminated water supplies. Garcia told CNN he would focus on just one piece of legislation to aid the Valley\u2019s struggling families \u2013 reinstating the enhanced monthly child tax credit that ended in 2021 after Democrats\u2019 efforts to extend it collapsed. \u201cI don\u2019t see (the special election) as a stepping stone. I see it as an opportunity to finally bring representation to a district that has been neglected for 10 years,\u201d said Garcia, a therapist and Marine veteran who unsuccessfully challenged Nunes in 2020 and decided to run in the district again after the US Capitol insurrection. \u201cGenerations upon generations of my family live in this valley and we\u2019re suffering with bad air, bad water. I\u2019m just sick of it,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI want to be a voice for those people who have no voice and have been left behind.\u201d The sense that the region\u2019s voters have been neglected was a unifying sentiment among the candidates, including Republican technology executive and former congressional aide Elizabeth Heng, who founded The New Internet, an encrypted internet browser that she said does not track or sell the information of its users. As the daughter of Chinese-Cambodian immigrants who grew up in Fresno working in her parents\u2019 grocery store, Heng told CNN she has been frustrated by what she called the lack of progress on top issues for the district\u2019s voters. She pointed to the scarcity of water, the need for both immigration and education overhauls, and what she views as a hostile climate for those trying to start or maintain businesses. She noted that she ran to address those same concerns as the 2018 Republican nominee in the 16th Congressional District, which she lost to Costa by 15 points. \u201cEven just the basic civil discourse here \u2013 it has completely deteriorated \u2013 and we need to have new faces, new leaders that can bridge the divide,\u201d said Heng. She argued she could be a \u201cleading voice\u201d in \u201cgetting our immigration policy resolved once and for all\u201d as the daughter of refugees who escaped the Khmer Rouge. \u201cWe need to come up with new ideas to be compassionate about the individuals that are already in our country \u2013 and on top of that, DACA recipients that through no fault of their own are in the state. We need to have a pathway to citizenship for them,\u201d she said, referring to immigrants who came to this country as children and were part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that is now in limbo. All of the Republican candidates supported Trump\u2019s border wall. Maher, a Navy veteran and former FBI agent, has said he hopes to foster a less polarizing conversation around immigration. He said he would work on legislation to \u201ccreate a clear pathway for people to come in and work and be able to return home.\u201d When asked whether he favors a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in this country, or even a narrower solution for the \u201cDreamers,\u201d Maher wouldn\u2019t commit to a specific plan. \u201cThis is not an issue that one congressman from the Central Valley is going to come and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to solve this entire thing,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that he is working with the Latino community in the Central Valley as well as business owners and farmers to determine the best solution based on the region\u2019s labor needs. Even longtime political observers of the region were skittish about making predictions in an unusually timed special election among a field of lesser-known candidates and low spending. Heng led the field in fundraising, according to the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission, after raising $214,900, followed by Garcia with $205,715. As the Central Valley got more competitive during Nunes\u2019 final terms, the veteran congressman enjoyed a comfortable lock on his district not only because of his rising national profile within the GOP as House Intelligence Committee chairman, but also his huge war chest. He held his seat with a comfortable 8-point margin in the 2020 \u2013 a slightly better showing than Trump, who defeated Biden by just over 5 points in the 22nd District. Nunes had poured more than $20 million into the race to dispatch Democrat Phil Arballo, who spent about a quarter of that amount and is now running in the new 13th District. In the most recent breakdown of party registration available from the state, nearly 39% of voters in the current 22nd District were registered as Republicans, 34% as Democrats and 20% as \u201cno party preference.\u201d During a Fresno County Republican Party forum earlier this year, Conway, Maher and Stoll all pledged to support Trump if he were to run for president in 2024. Heng said she believes there are some \u201cgreat\u201d potential GOP contenders including Trump, but said she believes all of the candidates should \u201cearn the support\u201d of voters through the primary process. All four GOP candidates said they would favor an audit of the 2020 presidential election during that recent forum, though Conway said her support would depend on what entity was conducting the audit. There is no evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election, and even GOP-led partisan \u201caudits\u201d have confirmed Biden\u2019s victory. The Republican registration edge in the district hasn\u2019t stopped the Democrats vying for Nunes\u2019 seat \u2013 Garcia and Lourin Hubbard \u2013 from championing some progressive policies that go well beyond even what Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed as a presidential candidate. Hubbard told CNN he favors eliminating all federal taxes on overtime to help lower- and middle-income families. He supports canceling student loan debt, favors tuition-free community college, and would also like to see \u201cdebt-free public college\u201d where the state and federal government defray the costs of four-year public universities. He also wants the federal government to guarantee every person in America a union job that pays at least $20 an hour. A manager at the state water resources control board, Hubbard said he is shaping a proposal that would ask the government to pay off existing medical debt of up to $25,000 or $50,000 for all Americans \u2013 noting it is one of the top reasons people go bankrupt \u2013 but said he had not yet calculated what that would cost. In his pitch to voters who hesitated about supporting a Democrat, Hubbard asked them to consider whether \u201cvoting for the same party, the same person, over the last 20 years really made a difference or an impact in your everyday life.\u201d \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result,\u201d he said. \u201cSo with this special election \u2013 and me not running for anything else \u2013 I\u2019ve kind of been freed up to say: \u2018Let\u2019s just try something new.\u2019\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "Republicans had already been agitating over the Biden administration\u2019s policies at the border \u2013 and then in came Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Early Tuesday morning in the Capitol, Mayorkas walked into the lion\u2019s den, taking a meeting with House GOP members of the \u201cborder security caucus\u201d \u2013 a group of members particularly fired up over the announcement last week that the White House would lift Trump-era covid restrictions at the border, known as Title 42. Republicans said they gave him an earful. \u201cIt was a rough crowd, and you got to give him a lot of credit for picking the roughest crowd, going in, and listening to them,\u201d said Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who attended the private briefing, where Mayorkas appeared voluntarily. \u201cNothing was really resolved, other than he made a promise to give a number of follow-up pieces of information.\u201d Added Rep. Brian Babin of Texas, the co-chairman of the caucus: \u201cWe appreciated his courage to come in, knowing that we were opposed to him 100%. But we were not satisfied with the answers he gave us.\u201d When asked if impeachment proceedings could be launched against Mayorkas in a GOP majority, Babin replied, \u201cDefinitely on the table.\u201d As the thorny politics of immigration have caused a rift within the Democratic Party, with a number of the party\u2019s most vulnerable members revolting against the Title 42 move, Republicans see the matter as a rallying cry that will be central to their push to take back the House and the Senate in the fall. GOP-led states sue over decision to end Trump-era pandemic restrictions at the US border The Title 42 move has upended efforts to pass a $10 billion Covid-19 relief bill, forced the Biden administration to quietly attempt to calm nerves on Capitol Hill and could lead to a series of tough questions for Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on Wednesday when he goes before the House Budget Committee. Republicans say they\u2019re not done yet, planning theatrics this week to consume the House floor and try to force votes on the issue \u2013 all an attempt to put the squeeze on vulnerable Democrats. While some leading Democrats say the policy must be lifted, they are uncertain about the political price they may pay for it. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, but I don\u2019t know if it will be a political problem or not,\u201d Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday. The decision to end Title 42 \u2013 which allowed migrants to be turned away at the border instead of processed under normal immigration rules during the global pandemic \u2013 is already causing problems on the legislative front, potentially scuttling a push to pass $10 billion in long-sought aid to deal with the pandemic. On Tuesday, Republicans blocked an effort to advance the Covid relief plan as they demanded votes on amendments \u2013 namely one to target the Title 42 policy. But unlike many vulnerable Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has backed the White House\u2019s move on Title 42, saying the current policy \u201cwreaked havoc on our asylum system.\u201d And the New York Democrat is rejecting calls for a vote on an amendment over the issue, a fight that could stall the package for vaccines and therapeutics for weeks. \u201cThe bottom line is this is a bipartisan agreement that does a whole lot of important good for the American people: vaccines, testing, therapeutics,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt should not be held hostage for an extraneous issue.\u201d In a private lunch on Tuesday, one Senate Democrat told CNN that the consensus among Democrats was to try and avoid holding a vote on the measure at all. Such an amendment would divide Democrats \u2013 and could potentially pass the Senate \u2013 and threaten the White House\u2019s immigration policies while embarrassing the President. Democrats in competitive reelection battles are now racing to distance themselves from President Joe Biden\u2019s decision-making and bracing for the possibility of a surge of migrants at the border, even as many acknowledge that the pandemic-era rule can\u2019t remain in perpetuity as a way to control the surge at the Southern border. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat who is close to the White House but who also faces voters this year, made clear his displeasure with the administration\u2019s move. \u201cI think this is the wrong time,\u201d Warnock told CNN. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen a plan.\u201d Several other Democrats in tough reelection battles echoed that sentiment. ICE lawyers told to dismiss low-priority cases in order to clear backlog ahead of surge \u201cThere are options,\u201d Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat up for reelection in the fall, said when asked if he\u2019d back an amendment on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s not a plan in place,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThis is a national security issue for the country, it\u2019s a public health issue as well \u2013 not only for people in communities on the southern border, but for migrants. We need an orderly process.\u201d The administration says it does have a plan to deal with the expected surge. Chris Magnus, commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, said once the policy ends May 23, they have taken a number of steps to prepare for an influx of migrants and beef up security at the border. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to prepare for this increase, ensure we continue to process people humanely, and impose consequences on those who break the law,\u201d Magnus said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, we will continue to use all available resources to secure our borders. This includes the increased use of technology, on-ground monitoring, use of drones and additional support personnel to supplement (Border Patrol) agents and free them up from processing duties whenever possible.\u201d But both the House and Senate Democratic chairmen of the homeland security committees are not yet sold on the administration\u2019s plan \u2013 even after getting briefed regularly by Mayorkas. Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, but also is in charge of the Senate Democratic campaign committee, said Tuesday, \u201cIt\u2019s important that the administration has a plan to deal with what will happen as a result of lifting\u201d the policy even as he said he\u2019s \u201cconfident\u201d it ultimately will. But asked if he supports lifting Title 42, Peters said: \u201cI want to see the plan, but it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, met Tuesday morning with Mayorkas to discuss the issue and warned that he still wanted to see a more robust plan for how the Homeland Security Department plans to combat a potential increase in border crossings this summer. \u201cObviously, the administration has to come with policies that would convince the public that this issue will be managed. Not controlled, but managed,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThe policies have to be clear. \u2026 I am being told those policies are being worked on as we speak.\u201d Asked if he was convinced that the administration\u2019s policies will be able to combat a surge, he said, \u201cWell, I will wait until I see the policy.\u201d Conservative Democrats, too, are pushing back. \u201cSecurity of the border is everything,\u201d said West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a leading moderate Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s everything. And we have to get our head straight about this and get secured borders.\u201d House GOP leaders are eager to keep Title 42 in the spotlight, with a strategy that is largely centered around messaging. The GOP leadership has encouraged Republicans to participate in a so-called conga line on Wednesday, according to GOP sources, in which members will line up on the House floor and repeatedly ask for unanimous consent to consider a bill from Republican Rep. Yvette Herrell of New Mexico that would keep the Trump-era policy in place. And last week, sources said Republican leaders began officially whipping support for a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d that would force a floor vote on that same bill if 218 lawmakers sign on to the effort. So far, 211 members have signed the petition: every single House Republican besides Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Conservative Rep. Chip Roy of Texas filed the petition last year, but has been steadily building support for it ever since; the effort picked up new steam in the wake of Biden\u2019s Title 42 announcement. \u201cWhat are they afraid of? Just put it on the floor,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIf you think it\u2019s bad policy, then put it up.\u201d When asked if he would support the discharge petition, Rep. Dean Phillips, a Minnesota Democrat in a tough reelection race, said he would have to look at it. But Phillips also made clear he has concerns with Biden\u2019s Title 42 decision, and said he has begun to express some of those worries to the White House. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the southern border twice. It appalled me, as it should appall any member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, and any American,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do concur that there should be a thoughtful, actionable plan in place before rescinding it. Plain and simple.\u201d \u201cI would be shocked and dismayed if they don\u2019t,\u201d Phillips added. \u201cHave I seen it? No.\u201d On Monday evening, the House Republican conference held a briefing with border patrol agents to hear how the end of Title 42 will impact their operations, then followed it up with a news conference in the Capitol afterward. \u201cYou know, President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, said they would do something about this and they have not,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. \u201cThey\u2019ve only opened it up worse.\u201d Republicans have already taken dozens of trips to the southern border since last year, and there are more in the works in the near future: McCarthy said he will lead another border trip at the end of this month. Republicans are confident that hammering Democrats over the border will not only energize their base, but also resonate with moderate and independent voters \u2013 especially since they have linked border security to the fentanyl crisis that has impacted communities all around the country. \u201cIt\u2019s far more than just aliens coming across, it\u2019s far more than just the drugs coming across. This is a national security issue that\u2019s gonna further get worse as time goes on this summer,\u201d said Rep. John Katko of New York, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee. One reason the GOP feels like it has the political upper hand: the National Republican Congressional Committee has shown members internal polling that shows the border is a salient issue in battleground districts, according to GOP sources. Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm, told CNN: \u201cDemocrats will pay a political price for their incompetence.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The war in Ukraine has shifted attention overseas, but even if President Joe Biden\u2019s approval has ticked up nominally, the national environment heading into the 2022 midterms still looks treacherous for his fellow Democrats as they try to hold their Senate majority. Russian President Vladimir Putin has given Biden a convenient foil on whom to blame high gas prices. (\u201cPutin\u2019s price hike,\u201d he has called it.) But Republicans are hammering Democrats for rising inflation, which they argue predates the conflict in Ukraine. A roadmap to the 2022 midterm elections Democrats point to the pandemic and stuck supply chains for the current inflation woes, blaming corporations for pocketing profits while Americans pay the price at the pump. The most vulnerable Democratic Senate incumbents \u2013 Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire \u2013 have tried to get ahead of the inevitable GOP attacks by introducing legislation that would suspend the federal gas tax through the end of the year. In a sign they\u2019re trying to distance themselves from the national party, most of them also sided with Republicans on a recent vote to overturn the requirement that passengers wear masks on public transportation. Establishing their own brands in their states, independent of Biden, will be a challenge for Democrats running in November if the President\u2019s approval rating remains in the low 40s. The party in the White House traditionally loses seats during the first midterm of a new president\u2019s term. Despite those obstacles, the Senate seat most likely to flip is still a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Pennsylvania has led this list since its incarnation \u2013 a testament to it being an open seat in a state Biden carried in 2020. The ranking is based on CNN\u2019s reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Two seats have traded places on the latest list, however, which underscores the difficult environment for Democrats: New Hampshire slides above North Carolina as more likely to flip. Republicans have their own challenges, though, mostly candidate-driven. May primaries in Ohio and Pennsylvania are heating up as GOP candidates jockey for former President Donald Trump\u2019s blessing. At the same time, candidates who do have his backing are finding that it doesn\u2019t solve all their problems. (Trump just rescinded his endorsement for the open Senate seat in Alabama, where Rep. Mo Brooks\u2019 campaign was underwhelming.) He\u2019s backed candidates in two competitive states with May primaries \u2013 Georgia and North Carolina. Trump's endorsement power will be put to the test as May primaries approach Much to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s chagrin, the chair of the GOP committee charged with flipping the Senate recently released an 11-point plan that calls for all Americans to pay income tax. Expect Democrats to tie all Republicans, even those who have disavowed the tax proposal, to Florida Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s plan (released by his campaign, not the National Republican Senatorial Committee). It\u2019s a tactic that House Democrats successfully used against the GOP in 2018, when they tied even Republicans who had voted against repealing Obamacare to that effort, and that Republicans used against Democrats in 2020 in linking the entire party to the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement. The paid media (i.e., television advertising) portion of the campaign is just taking off in many of these races, so we\u2019ll see how much that message sticks in the months to come. Here are the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip with less than eight months to go before Election Day: Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) Pennsylvania once again tops the list of seats most likely to flip. Republican candidates and super PACs have spent nearly $40 million in the open-seat race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey ahead of the May 17 primary, with much of it coming from Mehmet Oz and David McCormick and their allies. Trump has yet to weigh in after his chosen candidate dropped out in November, which is fueling even more spending as Republicans try to prove their loyalty to the former President. So what are all the attacks about? Much of the rhetoric is standard GOP primary fare, enlivened with some quirks from the candidates\u2019 biographies. Oz and allies of the former daytime host have attacked McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, as a \u201cWall Street insider\u201d and said he \u201cinvested billions in China,\u201d while casting Oz as an outsider like Trump. (His ads often cut to clips of Oz shaking hands with Trump as he welcomed him on his TV show.) McCormick and his allies have tried to tie Oz to Oprah Winfrey, Hollywood and former first lady Michelle Obama and say he \u201cpromoted Obamacare.\u201d (More on that here from CNN\u2019s KFile). McCormick has his own \u201cfight China\u201d message and has argued Oz\u2019s dual citizenship precludes him from putting \u201cAmerica first.\u201d (Oz has since vowed to renounce his Turkish citizenship if elected.) McCormick led Oz 24% to 15% in a Fox poll of GOP primary voters conducted in early March. Businessman Jeff Bartos, former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands and political commentator Kathy Barnette all drew single digits. But nearly a third of primary voters were undecided, per the Fox poll. As the GOP field has grown, the Democratic one has thinned with Val Arkoosh \u2013 a doctor and the only woman in the primary \u2013 dropping out in February. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and US Rep. Conor Lamb, both from Western Pennsylvania, are on the air, mostly with positive bio spots that give the primary a noticeably different tone than the GOP contest. Fetterman is seen as the current front-runner because of his fundraising advantage and statewide name recognition. But Lamb has a record of winning tough House races, with his ads touting that he\u2019s previously beaten \u201cthe Trump machine.\u201d Lamb has also picked up the endorsement of the Philadelphia Democratic Party. State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who hails from the vote-rich city, has some significant labor endorsements but is not on TV. The bottom line here is that both parties think the other side\u2019s primary will take the eventual nominee too far to the extremes. But, given how much the GOP primary is pushing candidates toward Trump in a state Biden won (and all the millions of dollars putting that message in front of voters), this Democratic pickup opportunity is still the most likely to change party hands. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election runoff last year. He has impressed with strong fundraising and is on the air with positive spots leaning into his background as a pastor and touting the legislation he\u2019s co-sponsored that would temporarily suspend the federal gas tax. Former NFL star Herschel Walker is the prohibitive Republican favorite in the May 24 primary, with both McConnell and Trump behind him. But attacks from his primary rivals and recent negative headlines over his business record could preview some of the scrutiny to come in the general election as Democrats gear up to face a first-time candidate whom much of the GOP establishment was bad mouthing this time last year. But even with an untested likely opponent and a fundraising prowess that bests longer-serving Democratic incumbents on this list, Warnock is highly vulnerable because of the fundamentals of Georgia. He narrowly overperformed Biden in 2020, but both won by close margins in this purple state. And given Biden\u2019s sagging approval ratings, the senator will need to maintain \u2013 and grow \u2013 his margins over the President. Turnout will be a crucial question in a midterm year, but in that regard, Democrats are excited that Stacey Abrams\u2019 candidacy for governor may help energize nonwhite voters. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson As the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020, Sen. Ron Johnson remains the most vulnerable GOP incumbent this year. A Marquette University Law School poll conducted at the end of February found that 45% of registered Wisconsin voters had an unfavorable view of him with only 33% seeing him favorably. Democrats were ecstatic that Johnson decided to break a pledge to serve only two terms, and they see political hay in his penchant for controversial remarks. See, for example, his recent call for Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they win control of Congress. That\u2019s a debate Democrats are happy to have after running on defending Obamacare in the 2018 midterms, when the law was much more popular than when Johnson last faced voters, in 2016. (Johnson later issued a clarifying statement, saying he he did not mean to suggest that repealing and replacing Obamacare should be a top priority for his party.) Still, Republicans note that Johnson has been underestimated before and has come from behind to win. And while Biden narrowly carried the Badger State, his approval rating is at 43% (with 52% disapproving), according to the same Marquette poll. The Democratic field remains largely unknown. Even Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, whom the Marquette poll found in the lead among Democratic primary voters with 23%, was unknown to 53% of them. Two of his challengers who have poured their own money into their campaigns \u2013 Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski \u2013 are on TV, so voters\u2019 familiarity with them could grow ahead of the August primary. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly The biggest news in Arizona over the past month is that GOP Gov. Doug Ducey said (again) that he would not run for Senate, which was a major relief for Democrats as Sen. Mark Kelly runs for a full six-year term in the purple state. The crowded field of GOP challengers, all jockeying for a Trump endorsement, is pulling the candidates to the right, potentially complicating the eventual nominee\u2019s ability to make a general election pivot after the August primary. (Former Sen. Martha McSally, whom Kelly defeated in a 2020 special election, struggled with this dynamic in her races for Senate.) State Attorney General Mark Brnovich is seen as the GOP front-runner, considering he\u2019s already won statewide, but he\u2019s struggled with fundraising. Venture capitalist Blake Masters picked up the backing of the anti-tax Club for Growth and already had the support of a super PAC funded by tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, his onetime boss, so he\u2019s not suffering for lack of outside assistance. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon, who had loaned his campaign $8 million by the end 2021, is up with plenty of ads talking about immigration. With the GOP primary still in flux, Kelly\u2019s using his massive fundraising advantage to run positive spots about infrastructure and his work to address supply chain issues, with Democrats also spending on Spanish-language ads. Like Warnock, Kelly overperformed Biden in 2020, but the national environment has gotten worse for Democrats since and they cannot count on presidential-level turnout this year. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is running ads featuring hospitality and restaurant workers touting her pandemic recovery efforts \u2013 another Democratic incumbent who\u2019s using her campaign coffers to go up with positive spots while she has the airwaves to herself. Her campaign and Democratic outside groups are also running Spanish-language ads \u2013 an important early investment in the Silver State. Former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who has the backing of Trump and McConnell, is expected to win the June Republican primary, but he still faces a well-funded opponent. Laxalt is the grandson of a former governor and senator with the same last name, but he lost his most recent election, the 2018 governor\u2019s race. Voters may know him more recently for serving as Trump\u2019s state campaign co-chair and echoing his election fraud claims, which Democrats point to in calling Laxalt too extreme for the state. But Biden didn\u2019t win Nevada by all that much (about 2 points), and in a challenging national environment \u2013 with voters here especially worried about inflation and the economy \u2013 Cortez Masto is likely in for a tough race. The former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair hasn\u2019t raised nearly as much money as two of her higher-profile colleagues up for reelection (Warnock and Kelly) and has less recent experience trying to distance herself from the national party when facing voters. She won with about 47% of the vote in 2016, underperforming Hillary Clinton, to become the first Latina elected to the US Senate. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is in for a competitive race, even without a challenge from GOP Gov. Chris Sununu. Yes, the Granite State has gone blue in every federal election in the past six years. And yes, by the numbers, it\u2019s the most daunting for Republicans given that Biden carried it by 7 points. But given Biden\u2019s low approval rating and a sour national mood, even a Republican with a much lower profile than Sununu should be able to keep this one close. Fifty-five percent of New Hampshire adults disapproved of Biden\u2019s job performance while 43% approved, according to a University of New Hampshire poll conducted in late February. Ratings of his handling of the economy were worse. Those may be difficult numbers for Hassan, a first-term senator, to overcome in an era when Senate races are increasingly nationalized. Just how competitive November\u2019s race is, however, may depend on what kind of campaigns Republicans Chuck Morse and Kevin Smith put together. There\u2019s still time for these relatively unknown candidates to introduce themselves, but a September primary also doesn\u2019t give them much time to position for the general election. Democrats think New Hampshire is one state where the abortion issue may prove to be particularly salient if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade this year, because of the higher concentration of college-educated voters in the Granite State. Nearly two-thirds of New Hampshire adults in that UNH poll (which was taken before Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court) said they wanted him to pick a justice who would vote to uphold Roe v. Wade. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) Trump took sides in the GOP primary in June, but his chosen candidate, US Rep. Ted Budd, hasn\u2019t cleared the field. \u201cHe\u2019s loved by, especially, the conservative wing of the party \u2014 highly respected guy,\u201d Trump told the Washington Examiner earlier this month. Budd has had plenty of help on the airwaves from the political arm of the Club for Growth, which has spent millions attacking former Gov. Pat McCrory ahead of the May 17 Republican primary. The latest back-and-forth in this race is about Putin. McCrory\u2019s first statewide TV ad accused Budd of being \u201cfriendly\u201d toward Russia, selectively splicing comments the congressman has made about the Russian President, including calling him a \u201cvery intelligent actor.\u201d The club responded with an ad calling McCrory\u2019s attack a \u201clow-down, dirty hit job\u201d and surfacing footage of Budd calling Putin \u201cevil\u201d and expressing support for Ukraine. Former Rep. Mark Walker and combat veteran Marjorie K. Eastman are still in the race but even if they peel some votes away from Budd or McCrory, it may not be enough to spoil an outright victory since the threshold needed to avoid a primary runoff is only 30%. The Democratic field is essentially set, with Cheri Beasley seeing her most viable opponents drop out. The former state Supreme Court chief justice hasn\u2019t raised as much money as some Democrats in other races. And even though she doesn\u2019t have a voting record, her judicial record could provide fodder for Republicans to try to paint her as soft on crime, similar to the way they\u2019ve gone after Jackson since her Supreme Court nomination. Democrats are hopeful that a Black woman who\u2019s previously been elected statewide will help mitigate the turnout problem they\u2019ve often faced in North Carolina, especially in midterm years, but that may not be enough to overcome any anti-Democratic headwinds in a Trump state. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who\u2019s likely to face Democratic Rep. Val Demings in the fall, starts this race ahead in a state that Trump carried twice. The war in Ukraine has brought plenty of earned media opportunities for the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. His campaign has attacked Biden and Democrats for not doing more to increase domestic oil production amid a surge in gas prices. Demings, who has impressed with her fundraising, has a compelling profile \u2013 she\u2019s a former Orlando police chief with firsthand experience fighting crime, a detail that appears prominently in her campaign media. But Republicans are signaling they will continue to tie her to the national party, even on the issue of rising crime rates. Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) The Buckeye State is playing host to one of the nastiest Republican primaries of the election cycle. But regardless of how badly dinged the eventual nominee emerges from the primary, he or she will start with the advantage for this open seat in an increasingly red state that Trump twice won by 8 points. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan faces a primary, too, but he\u2019s largely consolidated party support. It\u2019s possible the May 3 primary will be delayed because of uncertainty over state legislative and congressional maps. That would only give Republicans more time for the kinds of attacks that have made this a topsy-turvy race, with poll leads fluctuating depending on who\u2019s on the receiving end of the most televised vitriol. Businessman Mike Gibbons and former state Treasurer Josh Mandel led the pack in a Fox poll conducted in early March, with a quarter of GOP primary voters undecided. Things got so heated between them at a recent candidate forum that they had to be physically separated. Gibbons is leaning hard into the outsider businessman persona. \u201cLet\u2019s tell politicians, \u2018You\u2019re fired,\u2019\u201d he says in one recent spot. (There are plenty of similar ads \u2013 he had loaned his campaign more than $11 million by the end of last year.) As CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr reported, Trump has expressed concern about the general election viability of Mandel and is hung up about critical things \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author JD Vance has said about him in the past. Others in the race include former state GOP chair Jane Timken and state Sen. Matt Dolan. The Club for Growth\u2019s political arm, which is backing Mandel, has tried tying Timken to Russia, but she has the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, the co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus. (Ohio has a significant Ukrainian American population, although Portman\u2019s is not an endorsement that would go over well with Trump.) By far the biggest motif in GOP advertising isn\u2019t Russia, but something a little closer to home, although still some 1,500 miles away from Ohio \u2013 the US southern border with Mexico. Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring) The prospect of former Gov. Eric Greitens winning the GOP nomination was already causing headaches in a red state that has no other reason to go blue. Those pains got more intense when Greitens\u2019 ex-wife alleged he was physically abusive toward his children and her, according to court documents filed last week. (Greitens has denied this.) His primary opponents immediately called for him to drop out of the race, with some members of GOP leadership in Washington, DC, echoing that. Later in the week, Trump, who had previously left the door open to endorsing Greitens, gave US Rep. Billy Long reason to hope when he issued a positive statement about the former auctioneer. \u201cHave the great people of Missouri been considering the big, loud, and proud personality of Congressman Billy Long for the Senate?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is not an Endorsement, but I\u2019m just askin\u2019?\u201d Plenty of other candidates are vying for Trump\u2019s backing too. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt held a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago with Trump earlier this month. Sen. Josh Hawley, who called for Greitens to resign as governor in 2018, has already backed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler. The primary isn\u2019t until August 2, and so far, there\u2019s no sign Greitens is going anywhere. Democrat Lucas Kunce, a Marine veteran, outraised most of the top GOP candidates as of Dec. 31, 2021, but the Democratic nominee would not have an easy path to victory in a state that backed Trump by 15 points in 2020. The worsening headlines for Greitens could cause more Democrats to take another look at the race, but there\u2019s not much time before the candidate filing deadline on March 29.",

            "article_content": "If there\u2019s one nation that understands Ukraine\u2019s torment, it\u2019s Poland, which welcomes President Joe Biden on Friday as part of his emergency mission to shore up NATO\u2019s defenses following Russia\u2019s brutal invasion. In the United States, Biden\u2019s warnings that democracy is under siege from menacing autocrats can seem remote, even after former President Donald Trump\u2019s US Capitol insurrection and attempt to steal the 2020 election. But in Poland, which neighbors Ukraine, freedom is fresh enough to still be a novelty. In a tortured 20th-century history, the country \u2013 torn between East and West \u2013 was repeatedly conquered, was ruled by foreign tyrants and saw millions of its people purged or driven as refugees from homes destroyed by warfare. Poland again finds itself on the front line of conflict. It\u2019s on the dividing line between states in the NATO club, to which it now belongs, and President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russian orbit, which includes another Polish neighbor, Belarus. Poland has opened its borders to more than 2 million of the 3.7 million Ukrainians who have fled Putin\u2019s onslaught, and the war came close to its borders with a Russian strike on a base in western Ukraine earlier this month. 4 takeaways from Biden's day of emergency summits on Russia's invasion of Ukraine Like Ukraine, Poland lived for decades under Moscow\u2019s Communist iron fist. Like Ukrainians, Poles are often gritty, are deeply suspicious of Russians and have fighting for their freedom and sovereignty ingrained in their DNA. Unlike Ukraine, one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union, Poland made it to the West after decades under the Warsaw Pact umbrella. And in addition to being in NATO, it\u2019s a member of the European Union, albeit one that has had tensions recently with Brussels over its own flirtations with populist nationalism. As Putin\u2019s threat mounted in recent years, Poland hosted rotations of US troops and jets. In February, before Putin invaded Ukraine, Poland was one of the nations to which Biden ordered 3,000 troops to bolster the alliance\u2019s eastern flank. If the war in Ukraine spills over into a broader conflict between Russia and the West, a frightening prospect, there\u2019s a good chance it could happen in Poland. \u201cWe feel that it is the right place for (Biden) to go to be able to see troops, to be able to see humanitarian experts, and to be able to meet with a frontline and very vulnerable ally,\u201d US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said this week. Biden\u2019s trip comes several weeks after Vice President Kamala Harris was in Warsaw and helped ease a disagreement between the two governments about Poland\u2019s plan to send Soviet-era jets to Ukraine. Biden opposed the transfer, reasoning that it could be seen by Putin as an escalation of the conflict that could create a cascade of consequences and a showdown between the West and Russia, which would risk a nuclear exchange. Americans and American presidents are popular in Poland \u2013 a legacy of strong US support for the dissident Solidarity movement, which was nurtured in the shipyards of the northern city of Gdansk and created some of the first cracks in the Soviet Empire, with the support of the Polish Pope, John Paul II. Ronald Reagan, the American President mostly credited with winning the Cold War, was revered in Poland. And his successors have often found a warm welcome on European tours. Poland, conscious of its debt to the US and keen to build stronger ties to the West, sent troops to America\u2019s early 21st-century wars in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 even as many of Washington\u2019s older allies balked at joining the latter conflict. The refugee crisis is much bigger than Ukraine Over the next two days, Biden will meet Polish President Andrzej Duda and is expected to visit US forces sent to bolster Poland\u2019s defenses. Biden will visit some of the thousands of Ukrainian refugees in the country to shine a spotlight on the grave humanitarian crisis unleashed by Putin that is straining health and government services in Eastern Europe. Biden, who announced Thursday that the US would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, hinted after a NATO summit that he would meet some of the throngs of people who have fled Putin\u2019s civilian bombardments in Ukraine and his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Friday that Biden will meet with Ukrainian refugees and deliver a \u201cmajor address\u201d in Warsaw on Saturday. Ahead of that possible visit, the President reflected on refugees whom he had met in camps elsewhere in the world over the years. \u201cYou see children that are without parents in those camps \u2026 men and women who are completely lost \u2026 and you see that blank look on their face, that absolute feeling of \u2018My God, where am I?\u2019\u201d Biden said. US presidents have long seen Poland as an exemplar of freedoms that NATO was set up to safeguard and have lauded its long and successful battle for its own existence \u2013 a struggle that Ukraine is now waging. Poland was eviscerated in the middle of the 20th century when almost all of its substantial Jewish population was murdered in the Holocaust. The preserved camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, west of the southern city of Krakow, stand as a haunting memorial to the horrors of the Nazi occupation. The fall of the Third Reich didn\u2019t, however, bring liberation. Poland then endured nearly half a century of Communist repression imposed by Russia. In 2003, in Krakow, President George W. Bush lauded the eastward expansion of NATO, which has so irked Putin, saying it had brought \u201cthe peace and security of our alliance to the young democracies of Europe.\u201d At the time, however, Bush was more preoccupied with the twin wars in Afghanistan and Iraq launched after the September 11, 2001, attacks than a revived showdown with Moscow. Biden and Western leaders plan new ways to punish Russia for its war in Ukraine at emergency summits In 2014, marking the 25th anniversary of an election that started a process that led to the downfall of Communist rulers in Warsaw, President Barack Obama said: \u201cThe victory of 1989 was not inevitable. It was the culmination of centuries of Polish struggle.\u201d But Trump chose a different tone traveling to Warsaw in 2017 to align himself with right-wing forces in Poland and Europe hostile to the EU \u2013 a bloc that the-then President abhorred. In a speech that redefined traditional Western values and fleshed out his own brand of populist nationalism, Trump did reaffirm NATO\u2019s Article 5 creed that an attack on one member is an attack on all. But he also slammed US intelligence assessments that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election in remarks that bolstered Putin, warned that a wave of Muslim immigration and lax border controls threatened Western values and lashed out at American journalists in a nation that had been accused by the EU of eroding its own press freedoms. Biden\u2019s message will be very different. After meeting Duda in Warsaw on Saturday, the President will deliver a speech that the White House says will frame the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a challenge to the core purpose of his presidency at home and abroad: securing \u201ca future that is rooted in democratic principles.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Another record-breaking surge of migrants may attempt to cross the US-Mexico border this spring, alarming officials who are now rushing to build more facilities and lining up prison buses to help accommodate the new arrivals. The head of the US Border Patrol says he\u2019s getting ready for as many as 8,000 people to be apprehended daily, more than double the daily number of the 2019 surge under the Trump administration. Biden administration finalizes new rule reshaping US asylum system That staggering number \u201cwill probably become the norm over the next 30 to 45 days,\u201d Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz told CNN in an exclusive interview. There have already been 940,000 arrests this fiscal year, which started in October. The projections paint a grim outlook for the Biden administration just months from a politically contentious midterm election and as the administration tries to project a welcoming message to refugees amid the war in Ukraine. Border arrests ebb and flow regardless of who is in the Oval Office. But deteriorating conditions in Latin America that were exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic are among the factors that have contributed to people wanting to migrate to the United States. That\u2019s already put President Joe Biden in a precarious position following a surge of unaccompanied migrant children last spring and the abrupt arrival of thousands of primarily Haitian migrants last September. Officials have assessed those surges to better respond to future upticks in migrants and leverage agencies across the government to assist in the event of more arrivals, like the Bureau of Prisons which can provide vehicles for the transportation of migrants from the border to facilities for intake. \u201cWe\u2019re managing a flow that\u2019s significant,\u201d Ortiz told CNN. \u201cAs I get to, you know, 7,000 to 7,500 a day average, that\u2019s going to put additional strain.\u201d Over the course of the last year, Border Patrol has at times faced 8,000 encounters a day. The refugee crisis is much bigger than Ukraine Internal documents have shown estimates of how many people are within hours or days of the US-Mexico border who might plan to migrate to the United States, according to a source familiar with discussions. The Department of Homeland Security has set up a \u201cSouthwest Border Coordination Center\u201d at its headquarters to coordinate across multiple agencies. But as officials prepare for potential mass migration to the US southern border, some sectors are already feeling the strain. In Del Rio, Texas, agents faced groups of hundreds of migrants turning themselves over to agents for six consecutive days. Facilities across the border are over capacity already and held over 16,000 migrants on Tuesday morning, Ortiz told CNN. For two years, border authorities have relied on a public health authority, known as Title 42, to swiftly expel migrants, including asylum seekers, encountered at the US-Mexico border, an unprecedented departure from traditional protocols. Despite mounting pressure and scrutiny from Biden\u2019s allies, the administration has continued to rely on the authority. As the pandemic landscape evolves, discussions about terminating that order have picked up speed, sources tell CNN. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to release its latest assessment of the authority in the coming days. Senate Democrats, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have called on the administration to do away with the public health authority. \u201cAs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxes it domestic COVID-19 protocols, it is perplexing that the agency continues to recommend the extended use of this draconian policy at the border, contradicting the overwhelming signs of America\u2019s pandemic recovery under President Biden\u2019s leadership,\u201d Sens. Schumer, Bob Menendez, Alex Padilla, and Cory Booker said in a recent statement. If the public health order is terminated, the administration would return to traditional protocols which might include releasing migrants into the US while they go through their immigration proceedings, detaining migrants, or removing them if they don\u2019t have an asylum claim. On Thursday, the administration announced a new federal regulation that would shorten the process for migrants making an asylum claim, though it\u2019s not expected to take effect until the summer and will be a slow ramp up. The change in demographics has been an ongoing challenge for an agency built to address single adult males. Border facilities \u2013 akin to jail-like conditions \u2013 are not equipped to care for families and children who\u2019ve arrived at the border without their parents, especially in such large numbers, prompting a need for additional facilities. The Border Patrol uses soft-sided facilities for processing migrants in select locations along the US-Mexico border. But in anticipation of more people, the agency is planning to expand the current footprint of those facilities in Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas, Ortiz said. There are also ongoing discussions about so-called joint processing centers \u2013 a new concept where multiple agencies work together to intake migrants. The locations of those centers have not been determined. Eight years. Three Presidents. And still no resolution on an asylum claim. \u201cWe have, I think, improved conditions across the board. We just need additional capacity and that\u2019s part of why the academy is so important, why our processing coordinators are so important because we want to balance it out against out border security,\u201d Ortiz said, citing the Border Patrol Academy where agents get training before deploying to the field. Asked about whether the administration plans to offer Covid-19 vaccines to migrants, Ortiz said those discussions are ongoing. This month, 126 agents graduated from the Border Patrol Academy, including 35 agents this week who will soon be deployed to the field. Even so, the Department of Homeland Security is seeking more help within its workforce. DHS Deputy Secretary John Tien recently asked department personnel to volunteer at the US-Mexico border in an email sent to the workforce. Border Patrol also detailed 350 additional Border Patrol agents to assist at the US southern border and another 150 agents are helping with processing remotely. The Chief said he also plans to lean on groups, like Jose Andres\u2019 World Central Kitchen and the Red Cross, for aid. \u201cI want to continue those types of relationships, because that\u2019s a big part of our strategy is making sure one that you know, we can do everything we can to secure the border, but we can\u2019t do it by ourselves,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cWe have to work with our communities and partners and everyone else out there.\u201d",

            "article_content": "GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida faced intense backlash from Democrats and members of his own party for proposing a legislative agenda. House Republicans, however, aren\u2019t worried about opening themselves up to potential attacks as they prepare to unveil an official policy platform. \u201cThe difference between us and Rick Scott: Rick Scott did it by himself. It seems like he did it fast. We\u2019ve been at this for more than a year,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNN during a wide-ranging interview at the House GOP\u2019s annual policy retreat. \u201cWhat\u2019s better is you listen, you look at your pitfalls now, then you put it out to the American public, and if the American public supports it, you\u2019re not gonna be attacked when passing it.\u201d With gas prices, inflation and crime emerging as some of the most salient issues ahead of the midterm elections, Republicans are not only planning to use them as cudgels against the Democrats this November, they are also offering up their own set of policy prescriptions for those problems in their quest to win back the majority. McCarthy, a self-professed \u201cideas guy,\u201d tapped seven task forces last summer to start sketching out a legislative agenda for if Republicans recapture the majority, with the goal of releasing a document before the end of the summer that members can run on this fall. GOP lawmakers gathered here in Florida for their three-day retreat are now on a mission to home in on those policy plans and get them ready for prime time. \u201cElections are important, but I think it\u2019s more important than just running against another party to tell the American public what you\u2019ll do,\u201d McCarthy said at the news conference kicking off the retreat. The narrow focus on a legislative agenda illustrates how Republican leaders are leaning on policy plans to unite their members and win over voters this November, hoping to steer the spotlight away from some of the internal divisions and controversial personalities that have sometimes dominated their conference. This Republican senator just won't stop trolling Mitch McConnell But as Scott knows, showing voters what you stand for can be a lot harder than telling people what you\u2019re against. Not only is it difficult to reach intraparty consensus on thorny issues like immigration and health care, but whatever policy platform is publicly produced could be ripe for attack ads from the other party. That\u2019s why McCarthy\u2019s counterpart across the Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, opted to not even roll out a party agenda this year. Still, McCarthy and his top lieutenants believe that mapping out a legislative blueprint that already has broad buy-in from the conference will not only benefit their party come November, but will also help them govern and hit the ground running if they seize back power. \u201cThis is a conference-wide project, where every member is involved and engaged,\u201d said Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, the conference secretary. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s going to make for a better project, it\u2019s going to make for a better messaging proposal, but it\u2019s also going to help us govern when we take over.\u201d But Republicans weren\u2019t able to totally avoid sticky questions about their controversial fringe members at the retreat: GOP leaders were asked on Thursday whether recent comments from freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \u201cthug\u201d were damaging to the GOP message and brand. \u201c(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is an authoritarian. He is committing genocide. He is a war criminal. The House Republican Conference has been consistent on this,\u201d said Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik. \u201cWe were very honored to have President Zelensky deliver his remarks to a bipartisan House. And it was quite historic. \u201c The GOP\u2019s messaging document, dubbed the \u201cCommitment to America,\u201d is being modeled after the \u201cContract with America\u201d that helped fuel a House GOP wave in the 1994 midterms. That effort was spearheaded by former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has been advising GOP leaders as they plot their path back to the majority. Gingrich was the keynote speaker during the dinner reception during night one of the retreat, and he also sat in on a closed-door presentation from GOP leaders on Thursday morning. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many speakers here on purpose, because we want the engagement from the members themselves,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a few speakers who (we) wanted to make sure we have. The number one I wanted to have is Newt.\u201d The seven task forces that will be taking the lead in crafting the party\u2019s policy platform are Jobs and the Economy; Big Tech Censorship and Data; Future of American Freedoms; Climate and Conservation; American Security; Healthy Futures; and China Accountability. All of the task force chairs are holding presentations throughout the retreat. \u201cWe will be formulating a grand plan, so to speak,\u201d said Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the vice conference chairman. But the House GOP\u2019s party platform won\u2019t be a purely legislative endeavor: it will also highlight the oversight and investigations that Republicans plan to conduct into the Biden administration \u2014 a recognition that if Republicans take over, they will still have President Joe Biden in the White House for at least two years, meaning the likelihood of actually legislating is slim. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a whole part in here about accountability and oversight,\u201d McCarthy told CNN, name checking the origins of Covid-19 and the messy Afghanistan withdrawal. \u201cThat will be part of the Commitment to America.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how much the messaging document will focus on the culture wars that tend to animate the GOP base. But Thursday\u2019s dinner will feature Vivek Ramaswamy, author of \u201cWoke, Inc.\u201d \u201cHe not only has a tremendous background as a successful entrepreneur, he has really hit a chord in sharing with the American people his concerns of the dangers of the far left, woke movement and how to return to a culture of American excellence,\u201d Stefanik said. While Republicans feel like they have the political winds at their backs \u2013 they only need a net gain of five seats to seize back the House \u2013 GOP leaders used the retreat to both temper expectations and urge members not to take their foot off the gas pedal. \u201cThe thing that keeps me up at night is overconfidence,\u201d Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm, told CNN. \u201cYou gotta keep leading. This thing is a long ways to go. We haven\u2019t won anything yet.\u201d Emmer said he delivered a similar message during a recent closed-door political briefing with House Republicans. After announcing massive fundraising numbers, he jokingly told members to celebrate and take the day off. Then Emmer, a former hockey coach, quickly followed it up with: \u201cThat\u2019s bulls***. Nobody takes the day off. There\u2019s nothing to celebrate until you get across the finish line.\u201d The National Republican Congressional Committee also led a briefing at the retreat in Florida, where they highlighted a key statistic to show the political terrain facing Republicans this November. Members were warned that in the last election there were 30 Trump-won districts represented by Democrats, but as of right now, there will only be 12 of those seats in the next election, meaning there\u2019s less low-hanging fruit to target. \u201cThe playing field for us to win on Democratic territory is not going to be easy,\u201d McCarthy told CNN. When asked what he thought are the biggest mistakes Republicans could make between now and November, McCarthy was succinct: \u201cFighting among themselves, measuring their own drapes, and thinking majorities are given, not earned.\u201d Despite the pleas not to get complacent, the excitement among Republicans was palpable here at the Sawgrass Marriott Golf Resort & Spa, even as rain poured down during the first two days of the retreat. During one of the closed-door sessions, Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican, played a music video dubbed \u201cTake Back the House\u201d that featured clips of Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a crown photo shopped on her head and McCarthy and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise in flight suits, ready for battle. The video was met with a mix of laughter and applause, according to sources in the room. Republicans at the retreat also said they feel more unified than ever \u2013 especially compared to last year\u2019s retreat, which was dominated by internal GOP leadership drama. \u201cHouse Republicans have never been more united,\u201d Stefanik said Thursday morning. During last year\u2019s gathering, Rep. Liz Cheney publicly broke with McCarthy over the scope of a bipartisan January 6 commission, said lawmakers who objected to the 2020 election should be disqualified from running for president, and didn\u2019t rule out a 2024 bid of her own. Republicans were incensed, and moved quickly to dump the Wyoming Republican and replace her with Stefanik in the weeks that followed. But even with Cheney kicked out of leadership and hundreds of miles away, she was still a topic of conversation this year. Just as the policy gathering was kicking off on Wednesday, news broke that McCarthy would be hosting a fundraiser for Cheney\u2019s primary foe, with over 100 House Republicans joining the invite list, according to sources familiar with the event. McCarthy, in discussing the unity in his ranks, lamented that Cheney at the retreat last year was \u201cgoing out and doing her own thing. It wasn\u2019t about our policies.\u201d And some members sitting down for the presentations on Thursday jokingly asked each other: \u201cWhere is Cheney?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Lindsey Graham broke ranks in the Obama era, voting for President Barack Obama\u2019s two Supreme Court nominees. Under President Joe Biden, Graham has backed scores of lower court nominees \u2013 including Ketanji Brown Jackson to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals just last year. But now as GOP opposition is stiffening with Jackson up for a vote to sit on the Supreme Court, Graham has taken a markedly different approach \u2014 sharpening his attack on the nominee, making it all but certain he\u2019s going to vote against her nomination. In an interview with CNN, Graham pinned the blame on Biden \u2013 first for voting to filibuster Janice Rogers Brown, a Black woman picked by George W. Bush to serve on the DC Circuit nearly two decades ago, and more recently for picking Jackson over district court Judge Michelle Childs, whom Graham was pushing for the high court. \u201cHe made a political decision,\u201d Graham said of Biden. \u201cAll these are political decisions. The Supreme Court pick by every President has a political calculation. He made his decision that, \u2018I\u2019m not going down the consensus road. I\u2019m going go down the base road.\u2019 I\u2019ll make my decision based on his decision.\u201d The acknowledgment underscores the sharp shift over how Supreme Court nominees have been treated over the past couple decades \u2013 going from a time when senators used to be deferential to presidents of both parties to more recently where it\u2019s hard to even win a handful of defectors given the intense partisan battles. Each side blames the other for the deterioration, with Republicans slamming Democrats for their treatment of Bush and Trump nominees, while Democrats are quick to note that Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell held a vacant seat open for more than a year in order to let then-President Donald Trump put his imprint on the court. Now, as Jackson\u2019s marathon hearings wrap up and confirmation votes are slated to be held, it\u2019s almost certain that Jackson \u2013 a 51-year-old Ivy League educated judge who would be the first Black woman in history to sit on the high court and whose credentials and demeanor have been praised by both parties \u2013 won\u2019t be able to win more than a few Republican votes, meaning it could be one of the closest confirmation votes in US history. \u201cThings have changed so dramatically over the last 10 or 20 years,\u201d Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to really create a bipartisan unity. I hope we can on this but as you can tell, it\u2019s going to be a struggle.\u201d In 2018, Trump\u2019s pick of Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed by just a 50-48 vote \u2013 after being accused of sexual assault, something he furiously denied \u2013 the closest margin of any judicial nominee since Reconstruction. Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, didn\u2019t win any Democratic votes, confirmed just 52-48 over Democratic objections that the nomination was pushed through just days before the election. The narrow margins are a stark difference to the 96-3 vote the liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg enjoyed in 1993 and the 98-0 vote conservative Antonin Scalia won in 1986. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson faces intense questioning on second day of confirmation hearings For Jackson, Republicans are almost certain to vote against her en masse \u2013 raising concerns over her sentencing decisions for child pornography cases as a district court judge, her representation of Guantanamo Bay detainees as an attorney as well as her refusal to take positions on some hot-button issues, such as changing the size of the Supreme Court. Jackson has defended her record, saying she can\u2019t weigh in on a political issues like the size of the high court, while maintaining that serving as an attorney does not mean she has the same views as her client. And in several intense exchanges with Republicans, Jackson has said that her sentencing decisions in child pornography cases were based on the evidence in each case and the constraints on judges imposed by Congress. Democrats say her sentencing decisions are within the mainstream of judges across the country \u2013 including many backed by Republicans. But Republicans say they\u2019re not buying it. \u201cShe\u2019s been articulate and done a nice job in terms of her tone and demeanor,\u201d said Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota. \u201cBut I think that they\u2019ve drilled on down on the sentencing guidelines \u2013 and that is really starting to raise some alarms for our members.\u201d Thune\u2019s prediction that the universe of potential GOP \u201cyes\u201d votes is three \u2013 the same number of votes she won for her current post. \u201cRight now, it probably doesn\u2019t get much beyond that,\u201d Thune said. With Graham likely a \u201cno\u201d vote, it\u2019s uncertain where she could grow her vote count. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who doesn\u2019t sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee and voted for Jackson for the DC Circuit last year, was warm toward the judge when she met with her before the hearing, and said Wednesday she was still evaluating her position now. \u201cI had both the Health Committee and Intel yesterday. I watched some of the excerpts last night,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a decision until the hearings have been completed.\u201d Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who also voted for Jackson for the lower court and doesn\u2019t sit on the panel, says she is still evaluating the nominee and hasn\u2019t been able to watch all of the hearings yet. Murkowski, who is up for reelection in her red state this year, did say she had no issues with the GOP\u2019s line of questioning over Jackson\u2019s sentencing decisions in child porn cases. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fair line of questioning if, in fact through, through her tenure on the Sentencing Commission or as a judge previously there were there were issues with that,\u201d Murkowski said. That leaves a small universe of other senators \u2013 including retiring Republicans who could be \u201cyes\u201d votes. But those retiring Republicans \u2013 Sens. Pat Toomey, Richard Shelby, Richard Burr and Roy Blunt \u2013 all were mum about Jackson when asked about her on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with asking questions about this important area of the law and this important area to society,\u201d Blunt said, referring to the questions over her handling of child pornography cases. Sen. Rob Portman, a retiring Ohio Republican, said he was not sold on Jackson. \u201cI have concerns,\u201d Portman told CNN. \u201cI have expressed those after meeting with her personally: (her) judicial philosophy \u2026 but also I have a specific concern about regulatory issues.\u201d \u201cShe is more on the liberal side on a lot of these issues,\u201d Portman said. Some Republicans have indicated they are still open to backing her, even though they opposed her for the lower court. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican, said: \u201cI\u2019m watching it but I\u2019m still open-minded.\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN that Jackson \u201cis an impressive person,\u201d though he opposed her pick to the DC Circuit last year. Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican who has broken with his party on high-profile issues, also is viewed by Democrats as a winnable vote. But Romney told CNN recently he voted against Jackson to the D.C. Circuit because he viewed her as \u201cnot in the mainstream of judicial thought,\u201d even as he said he\u2019s keeping an open mind now. Susan Collins signals Biden Supreme Court pick could win her vote after 'productive' meeting On Wednesday, Romney said he was open to backing her but would \u201creview anything (the committee) thinks is important, and I\u2019ll take a look at it myself and make that decision.\u201d For Graham\u2019s part, he has had to reconcile his support for Jackson to sit on the second most important court in the country to his likely opposition for her ascension to the Supreme Court. At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Graham railed on Jackson\u2019s sentencing decisions of child pornographers and even criticized her as an \u201cactivist\u201d for being overturned on an immigration ruling while serving as a district judge \u2013 all topics that he could have raised before supporting her for the DC Circuit. \u201cThe bottom line is the difference between DC Circuit courts and Courts of Appeals, the Supreme Court, is the ability of a judge on the Supreme Court to make the law different than it is today, and I think that\u2019s something everybody\u2019s taking into consideration,\u201d Graham said in the interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a different game.\u201d Graham added that if Biden picked Childs, \u201cI could have gotten her a lot of votes.\u201d Now, Graham said: \u201cI think this is going to be really hard for Judge Brown,\u201d he said, referring to Jackson.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection is planning to produce a multi-media presentation and hire a writer as part of its effort to turn its largely secretive work into a compelling narrative, multiple sources tell CNN. The online multi-media presentation, which would include links to key video evidence, would be in addition to a traditional written report, according to a source familiar with the committee\u2019s work. Presenting its information in a comprehensive and engaging way will be crucial to creating a convincing argument for potential legislative changes as well as possible criminal referrals. It\u2019s also a recognition of how most people consume information in 2022 \u2013 and the massive amount of video evidence the committee has at its disposal. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to read like a clunky committee effort,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told CNN. \u201cWe want it to have an authorial voice that tells the story of what happened.\u201d The effort to hire a writer, confirmed to CNN by three sources familiar with the discussions, comes as the panel enters a new stage of its investigation. After collecting mountains of information, committee members must now determine how much of it to use in building its case to a public still inundated with images of rioting at the US Capitol but which may not understand the full extent of the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The committee plans to hold a series of hearings as early as May. Since last year, the committee has also been talking to people involved in the 9/11 commission for advice and guidance on how to incorporate its findings into a final report. \u201cThe committee takes seriously its duty to make sure the historic record is as complete as possible,\u201d said the source familiar with the committee\u2019s work. \u201cIt is dedicated to making sure the report is accessible, with all the facts and gravity of what happened.\u201d Some of these details were first reported Friday morning by the Washington Post, which said the committee is looking to recruit high-profile journalists. According to a source familiar with the matter, the committee has reached out to at least one journalist. Describing the type of candidate to take on the writing job, another source familiar with the decision said \u201cthe person who writes a press release isn\u2019t necessarily the person that\u2019s going to write the deep dive, and making sure that they can put the time and energy into it, was something that we talked about.\u201d The source added that Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the panel, first raised the idea of hiring an outside writer as early as November, and that it has remained an active conversation since. \u201cThe last we left it was it\u2019s something that we\u2019re seeking, but we also have someone in house who\u2019s taking on an expanded role to help,\u201d the source said. The process of winnowing down hundreds of witness testimonies and thousands of documents has spurred debate among committee members about how best to complete their work ahead of the midterm elections in the fall. One source described the committee as being \u201cin the slog\u201d with committee members and staff still thrashing out the best way to communicate everything they have gathered. The difficulty, this source says, is how to tell the story about people trying to overthrow the government without making it seem too political or polarizing. There has also been no decision yet about whether the committee will decide to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department, the source added. In a recent court filing, the panel alleged that right wing lawyer John Eastman and former President Donald Trump were part of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Whoever the committee hires to help craft its narrative will face the daunting task of turning months of material into a cogent report. The committee has already interviewed nearly 750 witnesses and collected more than 84,000 documents. It\u2019s also spent more than $2 million. In recent months, the committee\u2019s staff has grown to more than 40 people. A review of publicly available information reveals the staff\u2019s expertise varies widely, and often includes a law degree from top schools, such as the University of Virginia, Georgetown, Stanford or UCLA. Several attorneys for the committee have experience with the Department of Justice, including one who prosecuted notorious Mexican drug cartel leader Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman. Another served as an immigration attorney. Others spent time at DHS and on Capitol Hill. The panel has the added burden of operating in the shadow of the 2019 Mueller report, which at more than 400 pages was largely seen as underwhelming and had trouble breaking through to the American people after years of heightened anticipation. \u201cThe Muller report is the example of how we don\u2019t want it to read,\u201d said Raskin. Thompson has told reporters the committee could wrap up depositions as early as April 1. He has been reluctant to put a specific timeline as to when a report will be released. \u201cIt\u2019s a moving target. I mean, I wish I could tell you,\u201d Thompson told CNN. \u201cWe have some timetables, but when we get 10,000 pages of information that we need to go through, it moves.\u201d If the panel wraps up its depositions by April, it would likely leave a number of key Trump allies who have been subpoenaed in limbo, including Rudy Giuliani and former White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino. Giuliani has been engaging with the committee, through his attorney, and has signaled a willingness to answer questions but no formal cooperation agreement has been reached. While many close Trump allies have dodged the committee\u2019s attempts to compel them to cooperate, the committee has quietly had success obtaining testimony from a handful of lesser-known White House aides and staffers who were in the West Wing on January 6. In recent months, the committee has interviewed Nick Luna, former President Donald Trump\u2019s body man, Cassidy Hutchinson a former aide to then-chief of staff Mark Meadows, and Ross Worthington, a White House aide and one of the writers of Trump\u2019s speech on the ellipse on January 6. The committee has also had success in getting some level of cooperation from some Trump campaign officials. Katrina Pierson, a prominent campaign spokesperson who was part of a West Wing meeting leading up to January 6 has met with the committee, as has Max Miller a former White House and campaign official who is now running for Congress. Jason Miller, a long time spokesperson for Trump also met with the committee and his deposition was prominently featured in a legal brief filed by the committee designed to block Eastman\u2019s attempts to keep secret a tranche of emails the conservative attorney claimed should be protected by attorney client privilege. Exclusive: Newly obtained records show Trump and Jim Jordan spoke at length on morning of January 6 Members on the panel have also yet to make a decision on whether they want to subpoena their colleagues, such as Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, as the Republican lawmakers they have requested to hear from that hold key information have all turned down the voluntary requests. \u201cWe\u2019re doing multiple things at once,\u201d committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar told CNN, referring to the multiple and simultaneous conversations that are ongoing not only about the process moving forward but the questions hanging over the investigation. The lack of cooperation from key holdouts however, will not slow the panel\u2019s investigation down, according to members on the committee. \u201cWe really want to have engagement with everybody we approached. But some we\u2019ve been able to get it and some we haven\u2019t,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t given up. It\u2019s just that our report didn\u2019t rise or fall on one or two individuals.\u201d Aguilar, a California Democrat, told CNN, \u201cMaybe we won\u2019t ever hear from some of them. But we\u2019re not giving up yet. And we\u2019re still pursuing lines that would help us get the information we need.\u201d But just because members believe they can complete their investigation using alternative information sources, does not mean they will stop short of holding individuals accountable, even issuing criminal contempt referrals for specific subpoena targets after the final report is released. \u201cI think the committee is quite serious that everybody needs to participate. So yeah, I don\u2019t think we give anybody a free pass,\u201d said Raskin. \u201cYou know, what, one possibility is? That we draft a report, and we wait until the end to see if we get everybody\u2019s participation.\u201d There is also no firm agreement over what the structure or topic of the long-awaited series of hearings will be, even as the panel enters the time frame for when they have said they will take place. \u201cWe\u2019re, having those conversations now on what this looks like, timing and which topics to address first,\u201d said Aguilar.

            "article_content": "Texas Republicans will need a May runoff to decide their nominee for state attorney general after incumbent Ken Paxton fell short of clinching a majority in Tuesday\u2019s primary, setting up a showdown with Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush in May, CNN projects. Paxton led the four-candidate field by a comfortable margin, despite feisty and well-funded challenges from Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Rep. Louie Gohmert. \u201cI guess what I\u2019d say is, clearly, to the establishment: they got what they wanted,\u201d Paxton said in a speech to supporters late Tuesday. \u201cThey got me in a runoff.\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a two-term incumbent, will defeat a crowded field of GOP challengers to secure the gubernatorial nomination, while Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman and Senate and presidential candidate, will win the Democratic nomination, CNN projects. Votes are being counted in Texas in the first primaries of the 2022 midterms, with contests on both sides of the aisle poised to set the landscape for elections in November that could swing control of Congress to Republicans. But as the results came in, Texas shared the spotlight with President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union address on Capitol Hill and the rapidly escalating crisis in Ukraine, where invading forces from Russia are moving in on major cities across the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops were camped out on the Ukrainian border when early voting began in Texas on February 14, and while the conflict appears unlikely to influence Tuesday night\u2019s elections, quick-moving events at home and abroad underscore the challenges facing candidates as the 2022 midterms begin in earnest. 5 things to watch in the Texas primary election The banner contest on Tuesday revolved around Paxton, the two-term incumbent who filed a failed lawsuit seeking to effectively overturn the 2020 election and ran under a cloud of legal issues, with the possibility of more on the horizon. His GOP challengers, led by Bush and Guzman, argued he could endanger the GOP\u2019s effort to yet again sweep statewide offices. Polling ahead of Election Day showed Paxton with a commanding lead but suggested he would fall short of the majority he needed to win the nomination outright. Bush, the latest in a political dynasty that, even with the Republican Party now in thrall to former President Donald Trump, maintains a considerable stature in Texas political circles and this campaign amounted a referendum on the future of that dynasty. Like Bush, Guzman, who spent more than a decade on the state\u2019s high court, is a relative moderate. The pair clashed in a recent debate, which saw Guzman question Bush\u2019s qualifications and Bush denounce Guzman as a \u201cgutter politician.\u201d More troubling for Paxton, though, was been the candidacy of Gohmert, whose ideological and geographic base overlaps with Paxton\u2019s. The Democratic primary for attorney general will also go to a runoff, CNN projected. Hanging over the primary were concerns \u2013 at least among Democrats and voting rights advocates \u2013 about the effect of the state\u2019s restrictive new voting rules. Texas was the first of a number of Republican-led states to hold major elections after passing legislation, on the back of a political wave set off by Trump\u2019s long campaign to sow doubt over his loss in 2020, that complicates mail-in voting and outlaws other efforts to make the ballot more accessible. Some larger Texas counties have reported spikes in ballot rejections because would-be voters did not meet beefed-up and, to many, confusing new identification requirements. As polls closed, Harris County officials warned of delays in reporting results, due to \u201cdamaged ballot sheets that need to be duplicated,\u201d according to a press release issued by state election officials late Tuesday. Later that night, Harris County election officials said that this was merely a \u201cpreliminary discussion\u201d of a possible delay, and on Wednesday, they were confident they would meet the deadline to count votes while disputing earlier reports of \u201cdamaged ballots.\u201d The primaries brought some poll worker shortages and other glitches, but Election Day itself was mostly calm \u2013 with the scramble to fix the unusually high number of faulty mail-in ballots emerging as the biggest challenge from this first round of voting. The leading problem, said Isabel Longoria, who presides over elections in populous Harris County, was voters did not include identifying numbers on the return ballot envelopes under the flap. The tally of potential ballot rejections as of Monday would represent 30% of the mail-in-ballots submitted in the county. By contrast, fewer than 1% of mail-in ballots \u2013 or about 8,300 ballots statewide \u2013 were rejected in the 2020 general election, according to the US Election Assistance Commission. The decennial redistricting process has also added to primary night uncertainty \u2013 and intrigue. With a new congressional map designed to further reduce the number of contested seats on the map, most of both parties\u2019 nominees can expect that their primaries will be more fiercely fought than the contests that await in November. The diminishing number of swing districts means there has been an even greater focus on campaigns that cast opposing flanks of the parties against one another. For Democrats, those contrasts have been on vivid display in the 28th Congressional District, where Rep. Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats remaining in the House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros will advance to a runoff, CNN projected Wednesday. Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration attorney backed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, nearly ousted the congressman from the South Texas seat in 2020. But his district is modestly more Democratic this time around, and Cisneros had received a late boost in the race when it was revealed that Cuellar is under investigation by the FBI. Cuellar has denied any wrongdoing, and the specifics of the probe largely remain a mystery. In a cruel twist for the left, however, progressive candidate Tannya Benavides, who earned nearly 5% of the vote, may have siphoned enough support from Cisneros to prevent her from securing the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. Henry Cuellar is a political institution in South Texas. An FBI raid and a second challenge by progressive Jessica Cisneros could topple him Republicans, including Trump, outperformed expectations with Latino voters in the 2020 elections and Cuellar has argued that his harder line on immigration issues, in a district that runs from the San Antonio suburbs down to the Rio Grande Valley and along the border to Laredo, is the only path for Democrats in the region. But victory for Cisneros in May \u2013 and, should she win, the makeup of her coalition \u2013 will provide new insight into what the shifting margins from two years ago portend for the fall elections. Even in this first round of voting, the divisions in the party were clear from early in the night. Cisneros\u2019 backbone of support came from the San Antonio suburbs, while Cuellar dominated in the border counties \u2013 a breakdown that will give both flanks of the party reason to celebrate and cause to fret. The Republican primary for the 28th District was not decided Tuesday, with Cassy Garcia, a former staffer to Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, advancing to the runoff, CNN projects. The second spot for that May contest had not yet been called as of midday Wednesday. While Cuellar\u2019s bid for survival captured the most attention, Republicans were also closely watching GOP turnout in other parts of South Texas after stepping up their recruitment of candidates to run in a region that has been dominated by Democrats for decades. Monica De La Cruz, who pulled off a surprising finish when she came within 3 points of dispatching Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in 2020, will win the GOP nomination for the newly redrawn 15th District, CNN projects, bolstered by the endorsement of both Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Democrats look to win back Latino voters after Trump's inroads in South Texas The crowded Democratic race to face off with De La Cruz will be decided in a runoff. Afghanistan veteran Ruben Ramirez, a lawyer and former high school teacher backed by Gonzalez, has secured his spot, CNN projects, but it remains unclear whether John Villarreal Rigney, an attorney and owner of a South Texas construction firm, or Michelle Vallejo, a progressive small business owner endorsed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, will be joining him. Gonzalez is now running in the neighboring 34th District, which became more favorable for Democrats after redistricting. He will win his primary outright to move on the general election where he will face Mayra Flores, who will best three other candidates in the GOP primary, CNN projects. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Cuellar-Cisneros race, another progressive backed by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, former Austin City Council Member Greg Casar, will advance to November, CNN projects, after earning a comfortable majority in the Democratic primary for the 35th District, a safe blue seat. On the Republican side, a perceived lack of fealty to Trump was among the factors that endangered incumbent Reps. Van Taylor and Dan Crenshaw. Taylor\u2019s opponents in the 3rd District had attacked him over his vote to establish an independent commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The panel was rejected by Senate Republicans and effectively replaced by a select committee created by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But Taylor\u2019s vote riled some Trump supporters, which fueled the opposition against him. CNN projected that Taylor would advance to a May runoff against former Collin County Judge Keith Self, but the congressman suspended his reelection bid on Wednesday after admitting to an extra-marital affair. Allegations of Taylor\u2019s infidelity surfaced in right-wing media days before Tuesday\u2019s primary. Crenshaw, who ran unopposed in the 2020 GOP primary, triumphed over multiple challengers in the 2nd District attacking him from the right \u2013 a consequence, in part, of Texas Republicans\u2019 gerrymandering of the district to make it a safe red seat. Crenshaw is one of the most conservative members in the GOP conference, and was a signatory to Paxton\u2019s 2020 election lawsuit, but he has occasionally sparred with the former President\u2019s closest allies, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, most recently criticizing her for speaking at a White nationalist conference over the weekend. Greene and North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn were also opposing GOP leadership in the race to replace retiring GOP Rep. Kevin Brady in Texas\u2019 8th District. Former Navy SEAL Morgan Luttrell is the national party\u2019s choice, but far-right opponent Christian Collins had the backing of Greene, Cawthorn, Cruz, and Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff who was pardoned by Trump. The race was undecided as of Wednesday morning. This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "Texas kicks off the 2022 midterm elections Tuesday with the nation\u2019s first primaries. Two big-name Republicans, Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, will seek to beat back challenges from the right. In South Texas, the most conservative Democrat in the US House, Rep. Henry Cuellar, is attempting to survive a rematch against Jessica Cisneros, the progressive who nearly ousted him in the primary two years ago. The contests will be the first test of how the restrictive new voting law enacted by Texas Republicans last year will reshape the electorate. One important wrinkle in Texas: To win the primary, candidates don\u2019t just have to beat their rivals but must win more than 50% of the vote. Otherwise, the top two finishers advance to a head-to-head runoff election on May 24. That threshold could play an important role in several House primaries. Here are five things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s primaries in Texas: Texas is among the slew of Republican-dominated states that, amid former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about widespread voter fraud, enacted a new law that makes voting by mail more difficult and outlaws some options \u2013 such as drive-through and 24-hour early voting \u2013 that large Texas counties had used in 2020. Tuesday\u2019s primary will be the first election to take place under the restrictive new law. And operatives and activists across the nation will be watching closely to see how the law affects primary turnout. Already, there are signs that many more votes than usual will be turned away. Large Texas counties reported unusually large numbers of rejected mail-in ballots due to confusion over the state\u2019s new identification requirements for those ballots. Though other states with new voting laws, including Arizona, Florida and Georgia, have implemented different restrictions, many are similar to what Texas enacted, turning Tuesday into a first run that could offer a preview of what\u2019s to come in those states\u2019 primaries, as well. Jessica Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration attorney, came within a few points of ousting Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in their 2020 primary. Now, with Cuellar under investigation by the FBI, progressive groups like Justice Democrats, which recruited Cisneros to run, are increasingly optimistic about their chances to defeat the long-time incumbent and lone remaining House Democrat to consistently vote against abortion rights bills. Progressive heavyweights Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have both endorsed Cisneros, but recent ads from her campaign and its allies have focused on Cuellar\u2019s potential legal issues. One TV spot from Cisneros splices together news reports about the FBI probe. Cuellar, meanwhile, ran an ad titled, \u201cDon\u2019t believe her lies,\u201d which attacked Cisneros as insufficiently supportive of border security. Victory for Cisneros, in a district that covers a long stretch of the southern border but also extends as far north as San Antonio, would be a massive one for progressives, who were put on the back foot when Republicans, including Trump, outperformed expectations in South Texas in 2020. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a two-term incumbent, could be forced into a GOP primary runoff If he doesn\u2019t win a clear majority on Tuesday night. And with recent polling showing him falling short of that threshold, the big question in this very expensive race is which of the three challengers is most likely to advance to a potential one-on-one contest. Paxton, Trump\u2019s endorsed candidate, is running under a cloud of ethics concerns, including an unresolved 2015 indictment for securities fraud and more recent allegations, lodged by a group of his own (now former) top aides, that he abused his office. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing, but his primary opponents have sought to use his existing legal troubles \u2013 and the possibility of more to come \u2013 to undermine his bid for a third term. If he doesn\u2019t win the nomination outright, Paxton will face either Land Commissioner George P. Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman or US Rep. Louie Gohmert \u2013 all three of whom are well-funded with strong political brands across the state Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking a third term. And though he faces primary challengers \u2013 including Don Huffines, a former state senator, and Allen West, a former Florida congressman and former chairman of the Texas Republican Party \u2013 he is the heavy favorite to secure the GOP nomination. Abbott is on a collision course with Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman whose near-miss in the 2018 Senate race rocketed him to Democratic stardom, but who fell back to earth after a failed 2020 presidential primary run. Texas is a Republican-leaning state and economic and historical factors suggest 2022 will be a favorable year for the GOP. O\u2019Rourke, though, argues that Abbott\u2019s management is to blame for the widespread power outages during the 2021 winter storm in Texas and for the GOP\u2019s focus in the state on cultural issues \u2013 including passing a law that effectively outlaws abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy When Texas lawmakers redrew the state\u2019s congressional districts last year, they effectively turned swing districts into a thing of the past. Battlegrounds were turned into safe seats, some for Republicans and some for Democrats. Critics say this tactic could weaken your vote in 2022 That\u2019s made the primaries the most intense competition for seats in the US House. Republicans Reps. Dan Crenshaw, of Texas\u2019 2nd District, and Van Taylor, of the 3rd District, face challengers who argue they are insufficiently conservative and haven\u2019t been supportive enough of Trump. In the 8th District, where GOP Rep. Kevin Brady is retiring, establishment favorite Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL backed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC, faces far-right opponent Christian Collins, who\u2019s been supported by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn. In two open-seat races that favor Democrats, two leading contenders \u2013 former Austin City Councilman Greg Casar in the 35th District, who, like Cisneros, has been endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, and state Rep. Jasmine Crockett in the 30th District \u2013 are all but certain to lead the pack, but the key question is whether they will cross the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff.",

            "article_content": "As shoppers browsed the market stalls at the Pulga Los Portales in the Rio Grande Valley, Armando Acosta and Albino Zuniga caught up over breakfast before opening their loter\u00eda stand, where customers often stop to play the traditional Mexican bingo-style game. Over the past two years, these two friends have bonded through the twists and turns of the Covid-19 pandemic. But they diverge sharply over politics in this heavily Latino region of Texas, which had been viewed as a Democratic stronghold \u2013 until 2020. Former President Donald Trump dramatically improved his performance in many of the counties bordering Mexico compared to four years earlier \u2013 gains that led the GOP this year to redouble efforts to recruit and invest in South Texas candidates, including many of Hispanic descent, up and down the ballot. The question now is whether the inroads the GOP made in 2020 will hold as Democrats try to cling to their House majority in November. Tuesday\u2019s primaries in the Lone Star State \u2013 the first congressional primaries of 2022 \u2013 are an early test for the two parties as they try to turn out voters like Acosta, 40, and Zuniga, 56, with control of Congress eventually hinging on narrowly divided districts like this one. CNN spoke to several dozen Latino voters across the region, including here in the newly redrawn 15th District, an open seat that runs from the populous border areas near McAllen north to towns east of San Antonio. They raised an array of reasons why Trump resonated here more in 2020 than in 2016 \u2013 namely his relentless focus on getting the economy reopened after Covid shutdowns \u2013 as well as factors Democrats may need to address to win some of them back in 2022. Though many of his family members are Democrats, Zuniga backed Trump in the last presidential election, saying the then-President\u2019s message on immigration resonated for him as a legal immigrant from Mexico and the father of a Border Patrol agent. Trump\u2019s message about getting people back to work mid-pandemic also connected with the ethos of hard work and self-reliance Zuniga says is inherent in Hispanic culture along the border. He was repelled, Zuniga said, by what he sees as the liberal drift of the Democratic Party. Those feelings only deepened as he watched President Joe Biden and the Democrat-controlled Congress hand out more Covid-related benefits to certain individuals that he believes have been too generous. Though earlier Covid relief packages were passed under Trump with Republican support, that was a frequent criticism of Biden that CNN heard here from both Democratic and GOP voters voicing concerns about the economy and inflation. But Acosta hopes Latino voters will reward Democrats in November for economic relief passed by Congress under Biden, arguing that Republicans often look after the wealthy instead of those in need. He is supporting the congressional candidacy of progressive Democrat Michelle Vallejo, who co-owns Pulga Los Portales with her family and has championed a $15 minimum wage and Medicare for All. \u201cThe Rio Grande Valley is divided because there\u2019s a need for so many things like better salaries and infrastructure,\u201d Acosta said. \u201cDemocrats are mostly focused on helping the people and if they help people, we should support them.\u201d Stemming further losses among South Texas Latinos in 2022 and beyond first requires Democrats to diagnose what went wrong nearly two years ago \u2013 an exercise that more than a dozen political strategists, organizers and party officials who work in this region answer with different theories. The root cause, many Democrats say, was the party\u2019s suspension of most in-person campaigning and door-knocking during the pandemic, which they say allowed Republicans to lead one-sided conversations with voters. \u201cDemocrats literally tried to phone it in, and you can\u2019t do that,\u201d said Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Democratic congressman who\u2019s running for governor, as he made a recent swing through Brownsville to knock on doors. Trump, he added, offered \u201ca false choice between health and jobs,\u201d while \u201cwe left the field to them, literally, completely.\u201d But Sylvia Bruni, the chair of the Webb County Democrats, has urged her party to also take a harder look at aspects of the national Democratic message in 2020 and how it played in South Texas. There\u2019s a disconnect, for example, between strong support for abortion rights among Democrats nationally and voters in an area where Catholic views are deeply held. The disconnect sometimes extends to immigration and climate, too, amid concerns about border security in the Latino community here and anxiety about some Democrats\u2019 embrace of the Green New Deal in a region where jobs emanate from oil and gas. Bruni believes that Democrats did not effectively counter Republican messaging in 2020, especially on abortion, guns and oil and gas. \u201cThere was no message. \u2026 It was really, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Sylvia. I\u2019m a Democrat. I hear you\u2019re a Democrat. Are you going to vote for Joe Biden?\u2019 That was the message\u2026and the others were eating our lunch.\u201d She worries her party has not yet settled on strong, unifying themes for 2022 that will appeal to Latino voters and reverse GOP gains in the region. \u201cIf you do an inventory of everything this man, Biden, has been able to accomplish, it\u2019s really pretty impressive. But he\u2019s in a field of alligators, fielding off attacks and then working with a Congress that is absolutely hellbent on obstructing everything he does,\u201d she said. \u201cI know we have the substance from which to create the messages that fit the values of our community,\u201d she said. So far, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting it.\u201d Latinos were still a key part of both Biden\u2019s national coalition and his success in the Texas suburbs. Overall, Trump defeated Biden in the Lone Star State by less than 6 points in 2020 after defeating 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 9 points four years earlier. But Biden\u2019s winning margins in many of the counties along the border were much narrower than Clinton\u2019s in 2016. The operating assumption among Democrats was that Trump\u2019s rhetoric about immigration \u2013 dating back to his 2015 remarks that Mexico was sending criminals and rapists across the border \u2013 would continue to alienate Latino voters. Instead, he notched symbolic wins in places like Zapata County, flipping it from blue to red four years after Clinton had won it by 33 points. The margins in several Democratically held congressional districts in the Rio Grande Valley, including the current version of the 15th District, also tightened significantly in 2020. Republican Monica De La Cruz, who came within 3 points of toppling Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, is vying for the redrawn seat this year \u2013 this time with more vocal support from Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. After changes to the district lines, Gonzalez is running in the neighboring 34th District, where the turf looks more favorable to Democrats. Current Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who held his seat with 55% of the vote last cycle, is retiring. Both De La Cruz and Mayra Flores, a high-profile Latina running for the GOP nomination in the 34th District, are bullish about the November general election in their districts, in part because they believe Democrats have fundamentally miscalculated the concerns that many Latino voters have about management of the southern border, the treatment of Border Patrol agents and the influx of undocumented immigrants \u2013 a central focus of their campaigns. \u201cThe Hispanic values of faith, family, and freedom have always been the same,\u201d De La Cruz said during a recent interview at the Republican National Committee Hispanic Community Center in McAllen. Leaning into GOP talking points about the Democratic Party moving toward socialism, she alleged Democrats embrace critical race theory and disrespect law enforcement. \u201cNone of those values are reflective of what Hispanics feel and what they stand for,\u201d she said. Flores, who immigrated to the US as a child from Mexico and describes herself as a \u201cwalk-away\u201d from the Democratic Party after voting for Barack Obama in 2008, said concerns about border security particularly resonate with many South Texans. \u201cWe have families in Mexico that we are not visiting anymore because we\u2019re afraid,\u201d said Flores, who is married to a Border Patrol agent, as she went door to door talking to voters in Brownsville recently. \u201cWe don\u2019t want what we\u2019re afraid of to come here.\u201d She thinks Democrats took their votes for granted. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened in 2020. The Hispanic community in South Texas said, \u2018Hey, you do not own our vote. We are not loyal to you. And if you don\u2019t get to work, we\u2019re going to vote you out.\u2019\u201d Gonzalez, the incumbent who narrowly defeated De La Cruz in 2020 and now could face Flores in November if they both win their primaries, called that fiction. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t do well because he was a Republican. It was his personality \u2013 this bravado, lucha libre, if you will, that was attractive to many Latinos,\u201d he told CNN. Like O\u2019Rourke, he argued that restrictive campaign protocols during the pandemic led to the erosion in the Democratic Party\u2019s Latino support in South Texas. From the stage at a recent Tejano Democrats event, Gonzalez said some South Texans need to be reminded that Democrats brought them programs like Social Security and Medicare. \u201cThese people that think they\u2019re Republicans, many have just forgotten where they come from, and how we arrived and how we got here,\u201d he said. Democrat Ruben Ramirez, whose candidacy for the 15th District has been endorsed by Gonzalez, said Democrats must also connect with the economic anxiety that voters are feeling, which he tries to do by sharing his childhood experiences of living out of a car with his mom at one point and collecting extra cereal at school to bring home for his siblings. He often speaks to voters about how he thinks Democratic programs would \u201chelp lift all boats.\u201d Examining the 2020 shifts toward the GOP and where the Democratic message fell short, Equis Research, a Democratic-leaning polling and research consortium, found that Trump\u2019s approval rating in the final year before the 2020 election improved notably among both Latina voters and conservative Latino voters who displayed greater motivation to vote than in 2016. Equis Research co-founder Stephanie Valencia said one reason was that Latino voters in South Texas were more focused on their concerns about unemployment and the economy in 2020 than on Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, which had dominated the conversation in 2016. The anxiety over Covid-19 shutdowns and the economy, Equis Research concluded, \u201ccreated a permission structure for formerly hesitant Latinos to embrace Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d Valencia noted that Latinos have experienced the pandemic in a very direct way as essential workers, caretakers and small business owners. Trump spoke to their concerns about \u201ckeeping the lights on,\u201d she said, and now \u201cthere\u2019s a huge opportunity for the Biden administration to go out and sell its economic agenda, its job creation agenda to Latinos.\u201d But the hurdles facing Democrats are evident in conversations with many Latino voters here in South Texas. Joel Martinez, a 42-year-old corrections officer who said he voted for Trump because of his business background, echoed concerns about government stimulus money. \u201cThe whole stimulus thing, it\u2019s just supporting more \u2013 I\u2019m sorry to say it \u2013 laziness,\u201d he said as he emerged from a polling place in Edinburg. \u201cYou see it everywhere we go \u2013 \u2018Help wanted\u2019 \u2013 and nobody wants to fill in the gaps.\u201d There are different reasons behind the labor shortage and a fierce debate about whether extended unemployment benefits, stimulus checks and the child tax credit championed by the Biden administration have kept Americans from returning to work sooner. Inflation is also weighing heavily on Americans \u2013 leading some voters here to blame Biden and Democrats, while others say that accusation is unfair. Nancy Morales, a 43-year-old Edinburg voter who used to be a Democrat but supported Trump, blamed high prices on pandemic-era stimulus passed under Biden and Democrats. She shuddered thinking about her recent bill for dinner at Chili\u2019s and said she now reconsiders every trip out of the house because it costs so much to fill up her truck. \u201cEverything\u2019s going up,\u201d she said. \u201cI bought a lemon for 48 cents! Each lemon! I was like \u2018This is crazy!\u2019\u201d She hopes Republicans will have better ideas for getting prices under control and she is cheering on the new crop of GOP Latina candidates like De La Cruz, who she had just voted for in the 15th District primary. \u201cI said, \u2018Woo! We need a change here. Let\u2019s go ladies!\u2019\u201d Lusia Cortina, a Democrat who sells pre-arranged funeral plans at her stall at the Pulga Los Portales, said much of the economic blame Biden is shouldering is unfair and credits him with helping things return closer to a pre-pandemic normal. But even she criticized Biden (and Trump) for presiding over \u201ctoo much spending\u201d that she thinks led to over-reliance on the government. \u201cNow people don\u2019t want to even look for jobs,\u201d she said, arguing that Biden and his party need to convey it\u2019s up to Americans to \u201cget up on their own, instead of just handing them over the money.\u201d Both O\u2019Rourke and Vallejo, the Democratic candidate who co-owns the Pulga Los Portales, stressed that connecting with voters\u2019 more local concerns over last year\u2019s widespread power outages, for example, and the number of uninsured and under-insured people here will be critical in 2022. \u201cPeople are burned out. People are exhausted. People are concerned about how they could even make their day-by-day functional,\u201d Vallejo said. \u201cEvery single day we\u2019re showing up. \u2026 We\u2019re letting people know that there is someone here in the fight.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott faces seven Republican opponents in the March 1 Republican primary as he seeks a third term leading the Lone Star State. But he has spent most of his campaign attacking the likely Democratic nominee, Beto O\u2019Rourke. Left-leaning policy proposals pushed by O\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman, during his unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign have become campaign fodder for Abbott in the more conservative state. Abbott\u2019s campaign views the primary as a \u201cdress rehearsal for the general election,\u201d Dave Carney, general consultant for Abbott\u2019s reelection team, told CNN, adding that the focus was on turning out as many voters as possible \u201cso that we just have a larger base to draw on for the general.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re just running at full throttle to try to jack turnout on March 1. It\u2019s very simple. There\u2019s no trickery or \u2018strategery\u2019 or bank shots. It\u2019s just straight up turn out the vote,\u201d Carney said. Abbott began the campaign cycle facing intraparty criticism that he wasn\u2019t conservative enough and was too slow to fully reopen the state after the pandemic first hit. He has since leaned into hot-button Republican issues over the past year to counter those attacks. Now, he boasts a record that includes enacting new election and voting restrictions and a ban on abortions after six weeks. He issued an executive order forbidding all entities, including private employers, from enforcing vaccine mandates. He signed into law legislation to allow Texans to carry handguns without obtaining a permit or training, and a bill banning transgender youth from participating on school sports teams that correspond with their gender identity. And, earlier this month, Abbott asked the state\u2019s Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate cases of gender-affirming surgical treatments and hormone therapy given to transgender youth, saying such treatment constituted \u201cchild abuse.\u201d The strategy to cover his right flank appears to have worked. Abbott secured the endorsement of former President Donald Trump last year. And buoyed by high name recognition and a massive campaign war chest, he is well positioned to dominate Tuesday\u2019s GOP primary and secure the majority vote needed to avoid a runoff. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll from earlier this month showed him garnering the support of 60% of registered voters who intend to vote in the Republican primary. Abbott also led O\u2019Rourke 47% to 37% in a hypothetical November matchup, according to the survey. Abbott \u2013 who got his start in Texas politics as a state district judge before serving on the Texas Supreme Court and as state attorney general \u2013 launched his campaign last November with a focus on border security and police support. \u201cI want you to know I\u2019m running for reelection to protect and secure our border. I\u2019m running for reelection to support our police officers in the great state of Texas. And I\u2019m running to make sure Texas remains a job creation machine,\u201d he said in a video posted to his Twitter at the time. His campaign stressed that the emphasis on these issues is not a new one for Abbott. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about those things for five, four years now,\u201d Carney said. O\u2019Rourke, who faces only token opposition in the Democratic primary, drew national attention in 2018 when he held Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz to a narrow 3-point win. The following year he launched his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination but ended up suspending his campaign after eight months. Abbott\u2019s campaign has accused O\u2019Rourke of flip-flopping and backtracking on comments he made about the southern border, guns and the Green New Deal while running for president in 2020. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s just been all over the map. The Beto 3.0 is nothing like the Beto 1.0,\u201d Carney said. Abbott started attacking O\u2019Rourke as radical and out of touch for Texas even before O\u2019Rourke had made his gubernatorial candidacy official. An Abbott campaign ad from late October deceptively edited O\u2019Rourke\u2019s words about policing to try to make him sound more extreme, CNN reported at the time. O\u2019Rourke, for his part, has said he wants to focus on crime in a different way than his potential opponent, calling for providing police with \u201cthe resources they need to prevent and solve violent crime\u201d but also investing \u201cin mental health services, crisis counselors, and social workers to reduce the burden on police officers and more effectively address homelessness, mental health challenges, and substance abuse.\u201d On border security, O\u2019Rourke says he wants to make Texas a leader by reforming the process to create a \u201clegal, orderly system of immigration\u201d that will \u201cuphold\u201d the \u201ccountry\u2019s asylum laws.\u201d He\u2019s also criticized Abbott for the failure of the Texas power grid last year that left millions without power across the state. Abbott, whose campaign reported almost $50 million in its coffers as of February 20, faces seven challengers in the GOP primary. They include real estate executive and former state Sen. Don Huffines, former Florida congressman and onetime chairman of the Texas GOP Allen West and conservative commentator Chad Prather. Huffines has slammed Abbott as a Republican in name only, or RINO, and is running on a platform to \u201cfinish the wall, secure our elections and ban vaccine mandates.\u201d West released a 40-point list of reasons to \u201cfire Abbott.\u201d The retired Army lieutenant colonel cited concerns over the situation at the southern border, property taxes and the protocols around mask mandates during the pandemic. Prather, who told CNN he was recently banned on Facebook for a comment he made about January 6, has a massive social media following and hosts a show on the right-wing Blaze TV. He said he launched his campaign in part because he opposed Abbott\u2019s decision to implement mandates and shut down businesses without legislative counsel or oversight earlier in the pandemic. Prather said running against Abbott has been an \u201cuphill climb,\u201d citing the incumbent\u2019s name ID and record. But he said Texans are \u201ctired of seeing big government, they\u2019re tired of seeing the overreach, they\u2019re tired of seeing the bloated spending, as well as the spiraling upward of taxes on their property.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to put true conservativism back in place in Texas. And when I say that, what I mean is small government,\u201d he said. The other Republicans challenging Abbott are Rick Perry, who shares a name with the state\u2019s former governor, retired mortgage broker and philanthropist Kandy Kaye Horn, entrepreneur and businessman Danny Harrison and criminal defense attorney Paul Belew. 'Trying despite the odds': Beto O'Rourke embraces return to long-shot status in bid to oust Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Belew told CNN that he\u2019s \u201ca little bit more of a moderate,\u201d adding that he supports the legalization of THC and marijuana products as well as the introduction of gaming in Texas as a method to combat high property taxes and issues around immigration. \u201cI think it\u2019s a way to kind of bring the far right and the far left together a little bit. I\u2019ve kind of distanced myself from the radical rats where I live. They seem to be a little extreme,\u201d Belew said. Belew said his decision to throw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination was \u201cnot necessarily a decision to run against Governor Abbott.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s done a decent job, I just think it\u2019s time for a change and that\u2019s not always a bad thing,\u201d the candidate said. CNN reached out to the other Republican primary candidates\u2019 campaigns but did not hear back or receive answers to questions posed. While Trump has backed primary challengers to GOP incumbents in other races, notably in Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial contest, that\u2019s not the case in Texas, where the former President is standing by Abbott. In his endorsement last June, Trump said Abbott was a \u201cstaunch defender of the Second Amendment,\u201d \u201cvery tough on crime\u201d and \u201call in on Election Integrity,\u201d adding that \u201cno Governor has done more to secure the border and keep our communities safe than Governor Abbott.\u201d Last fall, however, Trump ramped up pressure on Abbott to allow an election audit bill, separate from the state\u2019s new election law that Abbott signed, to move forward in a state Trump won in 2020. The Trump-backed bill, which would have made it easier for candidates and others to request audits of election results, later died after Abbott failed to put it on the legislative agenda during a special session. But Abbott later requested redistributing $4 million in funding for the Texas secretary of state\u2019s office to build an \u201cElection Audit Division\u201d to oversee county election audits, as required by the new election law, The Texas Tribune reported. In his campaign for a third term, Abbott also has the support of groups such as the National Rifle Association, the Texas Farm Bureau Friends of Agriculture Fund and the Texas Association of Business\u2019 PAC. The Republican Governor\u2019s Association, which endorses incumbents in primary races and has backed Abbott this year, expressed confidence in his chances for reelection. It has not spent resources on the Texas governor\u2019s race so far. \u201cDemocrats always find new ways to waste money and Beto is the perfect candidate for them. He\u2019ll do as well against Greg Abbott as Wendy Davis and Lupe Valdez,\u201d RGA spokeswoman Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement, referring to the Democratic nominees Abbott defeated by double digits in 2014 and 2018, respectively. \u201cAnd while Democrats light their money on fire in Texas, the RGA is able to remain focused on our efforts to flip blue states in the region, like New Mexico and Kansas, to red.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Voting ends Tuesday in Texas, where the first primary races of the 2022 election cycle are taking place. The primary races will set the scene for several key races up and down the Texas ballot this year, including the Lone Star State\u2019s gubernatorial and attorney general elections. Tuesday\u2019s primary is the first election to be held under Texas\u2019 new elections law, which made significant changes to voting procedures in the state. Texans were able to early vote from February 14 to February 25, and some were eligible to mail in their ballots. Polls will be open on Tuesday. Governor At the top of the ticket, seven Republican challengers are looking to oust incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott, who\u2019s vying for a third-term as Texas\u2019 top executive. Buoyed by name recognition and the backing of former President Donald Trump, Abbott has spent most of his primary campaign focused on Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Democratic House member \u2013 and Senate and presidential candidate \u2013 who is favored to win the Democratic nomination. In the lead up to the primary, Abbott\u2019s GOP challengers, including former Texas Republican Party chair and former Florida Rep. Allen West and former Texas state Sen. Don Huffines, have pushed the governor further to the right on hot-button Republican issues after attacking him for not being conservative enough. Abbott now boasts a record that includes signing new elections law and a ban on abortions after six weeks. He also issued an executive order forbidding all entities, including private employers, from enforcing vaccine mandates. What to know about 6 other statewide jobs on Texas' midterm ballot Attorney general The race for attorney general comes as incumbent Ken Paxton, who is being challenged by three other conservative candidates, faces an indictment \u2013 though it\u2019s not the first time Paxton\u2019s run while under investigation. In 2018, the attorney general ran while being indicted on charges of securities fraud, and that case is ongoing. Now Paxton faces more allegations of wrongdoing, after members of his staff accused him of bribery and abuse of office in 2020. Paxton, who has the backing of Trump, is up against one of the former President\u2019s chief defenders, Rep. Louie Gomhert, as well as George P. Bush, the current Texas Land Commissioner as well as former President George W. Bush\u2019s nephew and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s son, and Eva Guzman, the former state Supreme Court justice and only woman running on the Republican side. 28th congressional district Down in South Texas, Rep. Henry Cuellar, considered a political institution in Laredo, is facing off in a rematch against 28-year-old progressive immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros. The race comes amid the backdrop of an FBI investigation into Cuellar \u2013 who survived his first matchup against Cisneros in 2020, winning by less than four percentage points. Cisneros is seizing on the FBI probe and capitalizing on progressive momentum. She has the support of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez as well as many progressive organizations who are looking to oust one of the House\u2019s most conservative Democrats. Cuellar is one of the only House Democrats who vocally disagrees with codifying the right to abortion and expanding abortion access. Polls in Texas open at 7 a.m. and will close at 7 p.m. local time. Most of Texas is on Central Time, but the western tip of the state around El Paso is on Mountain Time. Candidates need to win more than 50% of the vote in order to avoid a runoff. Any races that advance to a runoff will take place on May 24. Any voter in Texas can vote early in person. The first day of early in-person voting was February 14, and early voting in-person ended on February 25. To vote by mail, a person must meet one of five criteria: They will be away from their county on Election Day and during the hours that early voting is conducted, are sick or disabled, expected to give birth within three weeks before or after Election Day, are 65 years old or older on Election Day or are confined in jail or involuntary civil commitment. 'It's just a mess': Texas election officials and voting rights advocates face mounting challenges under new restrictive voting law Vote-by-mail applications must have been received by the early voting clerk by February 18, and mail-in ballots can be received 5 p.m. on March 3, as long as they\u2019re postmarked by 7 p.m. on March 1. This primary is the first statewide election in Texas to be conducted under the state\u2019s new restrictive election law. The law limited early voting hours, eliminated drive-through voting and added new ID requirements for mail voting, among other changes. The changes are already having an impact on voters. The deadline to register to vote was January 31.",

            "article_content": "Voting ends in the first primaries for the 2022 midterm elections in a matter of days. Texas will kick things off on March 1, and the primary process will wrap up more than six months later on September 13 in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Those contests will tee up Election Day on November 8, when control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs as well as several high-profile gubernatorial races in key battleground states. The outcome of November\u2019s elections will serve as a referendum on President Joe Biden\u2019s first two years in office and set the table for the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and congressional Democrats have scored some legislative victories and are poised to confirm a history-making pick to the Supreme Court in Ketanji Brown Jackson. Yet economic anxiety punctuated by inflation concerns combined with exhaustion over the coronavirus pandemic has tilted the political environment in favor of Republicans, who also have electoral history on their side. There is also a unique dynamic to these midterms, with former President Donald Trump eyeing a potential return to the White House and looking to lay the groundwork by endorsing candidates in GOP primaries who have embraced his lies about the 2020 election results. The majority in the Senate, currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker, is expected to come down to a handful of competitive races. There are four Democratic incumbents running in battleground states Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Republicans have incumbents seeking reelection in Wisconsin and Florida, and they\u2019re defending three open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio. In total, 34 Senate seats will be decided in November. In the House, Republicans need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. More than 40 members, mostly Democrats, have announced they are leaving Congress. Some of those decisions were driven by redistricting, the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional and state legislative boundaries. In states with partisan control of the process, both parties have tried to draw new maps to their advantage: to pick up more seats, shore up incumbents or reduce the number of competitive districts. There are currently 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic governors \u2013 with 36 seats up for grabs this November \u2013 including several in battleground states that could play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the 2024 election. Beyond elections for governor, state races for secretary of state and attorney general will receive unprecedented attention, as the battle over how elections are handled intensifies in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign. Here are the key dates and contests to watch as the 2022 primary process plays out: The Lone Star State is home to a few intriguing GOP statewide primaries and a House Democratic primary that highlights the ideological divide within the party. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking reelection to a third term, which could set the stage for a potential 2024 bid. First, he must get through a GOP primary that includes challenges from former (Florida) Rep. Allen West and businessman and ex-state Sen. Don Huffines. There is also a contested Republican primary in the race for state attorney general, with incumbent Ken Paxton being challenged by state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, US Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Paxton\u2019s rivals have taken aim at his legal problems, but Trump has thrown his support behind the incumbent, who led a failed effort to challenge the 2020 election results in four battleground states at the US Supreme Court. In south Texas, there is a rematch of a 2020 Democratic primary in the 28th Congressional District between centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who has received the endorsement of progressive leaders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The FBI searched Cuellar\u2019s home and campaign office in January, but the nine-term congressman released a video a week later vowing to seek reelection despite the \u201congoing investigation.\u201d The Dallas-area 3rd Congressional District is the site of a battle over how the GOP should handle the 2020 election and the events of January 6, 2021. Rep. Van Taylor is a conservative Republican, but he voted to accept the 2020 presidential election results and supported an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (He opposed the select committee that was eventually created.) He\u2019s now facing several primary challengers who question the results of the election, criticize Taylor\u2019s vote on the commission and downplay the Capitol insurrection. The district also became much more Republican in redistricting, so while the seat shouldn\u2019t be competitive in November, it could be easier for a more right-wing candidate to defeat Taylor in the primary. Former GOP Rep. Devin Nunes set off this special primary contest with his resignation from Congress in January to join Trump\u2019s new social media venture. Assuming no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the all-party primary, the top two finishers will face off in June, when California holds its general election primaries, giving the eventual winner about six months to represent this Central Valley seat in Congress. The district will have new boundaries for the election held in November. The Buckeye State has a pair of Republican primary battles that could offer early clues about the GOP electorate heading into the heart of the nominating calendar. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term. His management of the coronavirus pandemic has become the target of fierce criticism from opponent Jim Renacci, a former GOP congressman who has accused DeWine of governing Ohio \u201clike a blue-state liberal.\u201d On the Democratic side, it\u2019s a battle between two former mayors, with Dayton\u2019s Nan Whaley and Cincinnati\u2019s John Cranley squaring off for the nomination. In the GOP Senate primary, the crowded contest has at times veered toward political theater as several top contenders \u2013 most notably former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author J.D. Vance \u2013 have sought to burnish their conservative pro-Trump credentials with incendiary rhetoric and inflammatory displays of opposition to public health precautions. Former state GOP chair Jane Timken and businessman Mike Gibbons are also making plays for the Trump base, while state Sen. Matt Dolan is testing the theory that there is still room in the party for a candidate who doesn\u2019t fully embrace the former President. After a history of teasing potential statewide bids only to pass, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan decided to take the plunge (with a helpful shove from redistricting) and launched a bid for US Senate. He faces a primary challenge from consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. While Ohio has been trending red in recent years, Ryan is hoping to follow a similar blue-collar blueprint that has helped Sen. Sherrod Brown win statewide three times, most recently against Renacci in 2018. West Virginia is poised to hold the country\u2019s first incumbent vs. incumbent primary of the 2022 cycle, featuring GOP Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney. The Republicans were drawn into the new 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a House seat following the 2020 census. The matchup will be an early test of Trump\u2019s sway in GOP primaries, with the former President backing Mooney over McKinley, who did not object to counting the Electoral College vote and supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mooney objected to the Pennsylvania electoral count, but not Arizona, and voted against the infrastructure package. In Nebraska, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts urged Trump to stay out of the GOP primary to replace him, but the former President spurned the request and threw his support behind businessman Charles Herbster last October. Ricketts later endorsed Nebraska University Regent Jim Pillen, setting up a proxy battle between the two GOP leaders who both carried the Cornhusker State by wide margins. Meanwhile, in Nebraska\u2019s 1st Congressional District, embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood, who has been endorsed by Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Fortenberry was indicted last fall for allegedly concealing information and lying to federal authorities investigating illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The fight for the GOP Senate nomination in Pennsylvania could be one of the nastiest and most expensive primary contests of the entire 2022 cycle, with hedge fund executive David McCormick and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz trading pointed attacks over their personal ties to foreign countries. Both contenders are pumping massive amounts of their personal wealth into TV ads. The crowded field also includes former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, who, like the top contenders, is relying on her personal wealth, and Jeff Bartos, the party\u2019s 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor. The race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey was upended last November when Trump-backed candidate Sean Parnell ended his campaign amid scrutiny of his turbulent personal life. So far, the former President has held off on throwing his support behind another candidate, a move that could shake up the trajectory of the primary. Democrats see the Keystone State as perhaps the party\u2019s best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat. The competition on the Democratic side features candidates with distinct backgrounds who represent divergent ideological factions within the party. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an outspoken progressive and strong fundraiser, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor, are seen as the top contenders. Rounding out the field is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who has won the backing of some progressive groups. There is also a wide-open race for governor in Pennsylvania, with Democrat Tom Wolf term-limited. The lone Democratic candidate is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was one of the leading officials rebutting false claims about the commonwealth\u2019s 2020 election results. The GOP field includes state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US Attorney Bill McSwain, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and businessman Dave White. Trump, and his lies about the election, are expected to be a driving factor in the primary. In North Carolina, Trump\u2019s early surprise endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd failed to clear the GOP Senate primary field, with former Gov. Pat McCrory, former US Rep. Mark Walker and Army veteran Marjorie K. Eastman also in the running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Walker announced in January he would stay in the Senate race, defying Trump\u2019s effort to get the former congressman to drop his bid and run for a House seat. On the Democratic side, the party has largely cleared the field for former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley. Idaho is another state home to a GOP civil war, with Gov. Brad Little getting a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The two have engaged in a political tug-of-war, with McGeachin on multiple occasions using her powers as acting governor to issue executive orders while Little was out of state, only to have the governor rescind them upon his return. Trump endorsed McGeachin last November, calling her a \u201ca true supporter of MAGA from the very beginning.\u201d There is perhaps no state on the 2022 map where Trump is seeking to exert his influence on the Republican Party more than Georgia, where he rolled out a \u201cTrump ticket\u201d of candidates, including two who are challenging GOP incumbents the former President attacked after they rejected his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The top target for Trump is Gov. Brian Kemp, whose decision to certify Biden\u2019s narrow win in Georgia unleashed fierce and frequent attacks by the former President. The attacks culminated with Trump\u2019s endorsement of former US Sen. David Perdue after he launched a primary challenge against Kemp. Perdue lost his Senate runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021, which some Republicans blamed, in part, on Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the state\u2019s election results. Now Perdue is making Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election a cornerstone of his bid to defeat Kemp. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by less than 2 percentage points. While the GOP primary for governor is unsettled, Republican Herschel Walker has plenty of running room in the Senate race. The former football star has Trump\u2019s support as he seeks to defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who scored a 2-point victory in a Senate special election runoff against Republican Kelly Loeffler last year. Warnock has been a prolific fundraiser, beginning 2022 with nearly $23 million in the bank. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood up to Trump\u2019s demands that he \u201cfind\u201d the votes to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Now the question is whether the state\u2019s top election official can withstand a primary challenge from Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice, who embraced the former President\u2019s false claims about the election. Among the Democratic contenders are state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who succeeded Abrams in the state legislature, and former Fulton County Commission chair John Eaves. The Atlanta area will host the year\u2019s first Democratic member vs. member primary, with Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux running in the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District after the GOP-controlled state legislature turned McBath\u2019s current seat safely red. Both Democrats flipped suburban districts previously held by Republicans \u2013 McBath in 2018 and Bourdeaux in 2020. Georgia won\u2019t be the only state testing the power of Trump\u2019s endorsement on this primary day. In Alabama, US Rep. Mo Brooks is hoping the former President\u2019s support will help deliver him the GOP Senate nomination. But the conservative firebrand is running against two well-funded opponents: Katie Britt, a former top aide to retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, and Mike Durant, an aerospace executive and former Blackhawk helicopter pilot. Brooks has struggled to take command of the field, prompting frustration from the former President. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey is running for a second full term but is being challenged by several candidates in the GOP primary, including Lindy Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration. Blanchard initially launched a bid for the open Senate seat but switched gears to run for governor last December. In Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2013 a former White House press secretary under Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee \u2013 has a clear path to the Republican nomination as she seeks to succeed GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson. With Trump having carried the Natural State by more than 20 points in 2020, Sanders is poised to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps and become Arkansas\u2019 first female governor. Last September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the second governor in US history to defeat a recall. Now the Democrat appears to be coasting toward a second term in office \u2013 which could serve as a platform for a national run down the road. There are already signs of a brewing feud between Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a top GOP 2024 prospect. Sen. Alex Padilla, appointed by Newsom to the seat vacated by Harris ahead of her becoming vice president, is running for a full six-year term. At the same time, Padilla must run in a special election for the remaining weeks of the original Harris term. California is losing a US House seat for the first time in the state\u2019s history because of slower population growth. The new congressional maps, drawn by an independent commission, have scrambled the Golden State\u2019s political landscape. With the potential for as many as 10 competitive House races this fall, the state\u2019s top-two primary system could be a major factor in shaping the battleground map. GOP Rep. David Valadao is running in the newly drawn 22nd District in the Central Valley, which became more favorable to Democrats under redistricting. Valadao is the only House Republican running for reelection who voted for to impeach Trump in 2021 for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and doesn\u2019t have a challenger endorsed by the former President (yet). Among his Democratic challengers is Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council. Another race to keep an eye on is the new 27th District around Los Angeles, where GOP Rep. Mike Garcia is a top target of Democrats. His challengers include former state assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is running for a third time against Garcia. She lost a special election and general election to him in 2020, with the latter race decided by a margin of just 333 votes. Democrat Quaye Quartey, a retired Navy intelligence officer, is also running. Prior to serving as Trump\u2019s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke spent about two years representing Montana in the US House. Zinke is now eyeing a return to Capitol Hill after Montana gained a House seat following the 2020 census, though he\u2019s facing scrutiny about his current ties to the state. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most endangered Senate Democrats running this year, looking to carry a state Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020. The top contender in the GOP field is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the party\u2019s 2018 nominee for governor, who has managed to unite the Trump and Mitch McConnell wings. Still, he is facing a primary challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, who has demonstrated some fundraising strength. In the Silver State\u2019s race for governor, incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak is seeking a second term, with several Republicans lining up to run against him, including former US Sen. Dean Heller and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. The fate of two Trump targets could be decided this day in South Carolina, where the former President has endorsed primary challengers to GOP Reps. Tom Rice and Nancy Mace. In the 7th Congressional District, Trump has backed state Rep. Russell Fry against Rice, who was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of Trump\u2019s impeachment last January. Mace, who represents the 1st District, voted to certify the election results (but not for impeachment) and has tried to walk the Trump tightrope, criticizing his actions at times and embracing the former President at others. Trump has thrown his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford in the 2018 GOP primary for the 1st District, only to lose to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election. In Maine, a pair of Republicans are attempting political comebacks \u2013 with former Gov. Paul LePage and former US Rep. Bruce Poliquin both running for their old jobs. LePage is looking to challenge Democrat Janet Mills, who won the 2018 race to succeed him. Poliquin is eyeing a rematch in the 2nd Congressional District with Jared Golden, the Democrat who defeated him four years ago. Last November\u2019s victory by Republican Glenn Youngkin in the race for Virginia governor boosted the GOP\u2019s hopes that 2022 would be a strong year for the party in the commonwealth and beyond. This year, the battleground in the Old Dominion will center on two competitive House races featuring a pair of Democrats first elected in the 2018 blue wave \u2013 Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. A handful Republicans have lined up to challenge Spanberger in the new 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn to include more of the Democratic-leaning exurbs in Northern Virginia but no longer includes the congresswoman\u2019s home near Richmond. Luria\u2019s 2nd District, meanwhile, became more favorable to Republicans under redistricting, with state Sen. Jen Kiggans seen as a top contender in the GOP primary. The Land of Lincoln is the scene of not one but two dual incumbent House primaries after Illinois lost a seat based on the 2020 census. The GOP contest in the 15th District will provide another test of Trump\u2019s endorsement strength, with Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis facing off. The former President rebuffed the advice of GOP leaders to remain neutral and threw his support behind Miller, a freshman member who has stirred controversy since arriving in Congress. Davis, now in his fifth term, is an ally of House Republican leadership and poised to become a committee chairman if the GOP wins control of the chamber. Democrats have their own incumbent vs. incumbent primary in the 6th District, where Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman will compete for the party\u2019s nomination. Casten flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018 while Newman narrowly defeated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in a 2020 primary before winning her general election race by double digits. On the same day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will face off against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams in the Democratic primary as Hochul seeks a full term in office. Hochul became the first female governor of the Empire State last August after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. Among the candidates on the Republican side are Rep. Lee Zeldin, 2014 GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. With popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan unable to run for a third term in Maryland, Democrats are hopeful about their prospects of retaking the governor\u2019s mansion after eight years of Republican rule. That optimism has produced a crowded Democratic field, which includes former US Labor Secretary Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot, author and former nonprofit chief Wes Moore and former US Education Secretary John King. Trump has endorsed state Del. Daniel Cox, who is running in the GOP primary against Hogan\u2019s preferred candidate, state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz. The calendar in July is rather bare, unless any of the North Carolina primary contests in May require a runoff to decide the winner. Candidates only need to top 30% of the vote to avoid that scenario. Two states at the center of Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election will vote on this day \u2013 Arizona and Michigan. Sparked by the former President\u2019s falsehoods, GOP lawmakers in Arizona launched a months-long partisan review of the results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, which ultimately confirmed Biden\u2019s victory there. That fact has failed to dissuade Republican candidates from embracing Trump\u2019s baseless claims. The former President has endorsed former TV anchor Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state, both of whom have cast doubts about the 2020 election results. Current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor, putting her defense of the state\u2019s elections at the center of her candidacy. In addition to Lake, the other Republican contenders include former US Rep. Matt Salmon, developer and former Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson and businessman Steve Gaynor. Finchem is joined in the GOP secretary of state primary by state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has advocated for so-called election integrity legislation. The Democratic candidates hoping to succeed Hobbs include Adrian Fontes, the former Maricopa County recorder, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding. Trump has yet to endorse in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but his impact on the field has been felt in how the leading candidates are positioning themselves to align with the former President\u2019s policies and politics. That list of hopefuls includes state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who has the backing of tech billionaire Peter Thiel and the anti-tax Club for Growth. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and his massive campaign war chest await whichever candidate emerges victorious on the Republican side. The former astronaut is running for a full six-year term after defeating appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a 2020 special election. In Michigan, Trump has endorsed two statewide candidates who\u2019ve spread election falsehoods \u2013 Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for state attorney general. They are seeking to challenge incumbent Democrats Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel, who have pushed back on Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the state\u2019s 2020 election results. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on Biden\u2019s short list for vice president, is also seeking a second term. Businessman Kevin Rinke and former Detroit police chief James Craig are among a packed field of GOP candidates looking to challenge Whitmer. The new congressional map in Michigan has set up an all-incumbent primary battle in the 11th district featuring Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin. The district\u2019s new lines make it a safer seat for Democrats than the one Stevens flipped in 2018. Levin has deep political roots in the state, with his father, Sander, serving in the US House for more than 30 years and his uncle Carl Levin serving six terms as a US senator. GOP Rep. Peter Meijer is running for reelection in Michigan\u2019s 3rd Congressional District after voting for impeachment and faces a primary challenge in John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who has the backing of the former President. Trump has also endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, who had launched a bid against Rep. Fred Upton, another GOP member who voted to impeach. But Upton has not yet officially announced if he\u2019s running for another term, which would mean having to face off against fellow GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga in the newly drawn 4th District. Two House Republicans from Washington who voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse \u2013 will also face GOP primary voters on this day. Both have Trump-backed opponents in their all-party primaries. Retired Army Special Forces officer Joe Kent is challenging Beutler, while failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is seeking to oust Newhouse. Like in California, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation. In Missouri, there is a crowded GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt in a state that should favor the party. Some Republicans are concerned that if former Gov. Eric Greitens emerges as the nominee, it could put the seat in play for Democrats, given his scandal-plagued past. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has endorsed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long, state Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Schatz and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey also in the mix. On the Democratic side, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce appears to be the leading contender. Tennessee Republicans cracked Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper\u2019s Nashville-based seat in redistricting, diluting the power of the vote in Davidson County, spreading it across three GOP-leaning districts. The move prompted Cooper to announce his retirement. It has also sparked a GOP showdown for the new 5th Congressional District. Trump is backing Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokesperson, while two top allies of the former President \u2013 US Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn \u2013 are supporting social media influencer Robby Starbuck. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell is running for the redrawn seat as well. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican senator seeking reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. A dozen Democrats have lined up to take on the two-term incumbent, who has evolved from a tea party insurgent during his first run in 2010 to a promoter of Covid-19 and January 6 conspiracies. The leading Democratic challengers appear to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski. The GOP field to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is less crowded, with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun and Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the 2018 Senate Republican primary, among the contenders. The last time a Republican candidate won a statewide office in Minnesota was 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was narrowly reelected. Several Republicans are running to prevent Democratic Gov. Tim Walz from winning a second term. Misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 election have been key issues in the GOP primary. One leading candidate is Scott Jensen, a former state senator and family doctor, who has voiced vaccine skepticism and opposition to mandates. Another physician, Neil Shah, has suggested he took an unproven drug to treat coronavirus. At a forum last December, none of the five candidates who participated were willing to answer a plain \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether they thought Biden won a \u201cconstitutional majority in the Electoral College.\u201d Ultimately, whether Republicans lean toward a candidate like Jensen or Shah or a more mainstream pick like state Sens. Paul Gazelka or Michelle Benson, the primary may well be decided long before August. The state GOP will endorse a candidate at its convention in May and most, if not all, of the other candidates could drop their bids if they don\u2019t earn that nod. Vermont is the only state in the union that\u2019s never sent a woman to Congress. But Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy\u2019s decision to call it quits after almost 50 years in the Senate started a domino effect that could change that. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the state\u2019s lone House member, is trying to move across the Capitol to succeed Leahy. That\u2019s set up a Democratic primary in which two of the leading candidates are women. Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint both declared for the seat shortly after Welch made his announcement. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who leads one of the most Democratic states in the nation, will also be up for reelection (Vermont governors serve two-year terms) but he\u2019s yet to announce his plans. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, also face voters this year. Term limits prevent Hawaii Gov. David Ige from seeking a third term, and several Democrats have lined up to succeed him. The primary field includes Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a doctor who has been one of the main faces of the state\u2019s pandemic response, former Hawaii first lady Vicky Cayetano and former Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. US Rep. Kai Kahele has also been mentioned as a potential candidate. Hawaii is one of the most Democratic states in the country, so the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored in November. Two of Trump\u2019s top GOP targets in 2022 are Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The coincidence of both states holding primaries on the same day sets up an epic test of the former President\u2019s sway in the GOP. There is arguably no Republican who has drawn Trump\u2019s ire more than Cheney, who voted in favor of impeachment last year and is the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a onetime critic, as the candidate to fulfill his goal of ousting Cheney. So has House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And the Republican National Committee took the unprecedented step of censuring the congreswoman. Working in Cheney\u2019s favor are her family\u2019s deep roots in the state and her massive campaign war chest. She also might benefit from the fact that she could win the primary without receiving a majority of the vote, as Hageman has not cleared the field of Cheney challengers despite Trump\u2019s support. Murkowski is the lone Republican running for reelection this year who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial in the Senate. The former President has backed Kelly Tshibaka, who formerly led Alaska\u2019s Department of Administration. But the race in Alaska will be complicated by the state\u2019s new election system, with all the Senate candidates running on a single ballot and the top four finishers, regardless of party, advancing to the general election, which will be decided by ranked-choice voting. Given that, Murkowski is almost certain to advance to the November vote, where she could benefit from the reallocation process. The senator has faced tough reelection campaigns before \u2013 winning as a write-in candidate in 2010 after losing the GOP primary to a tea party challenger. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies are firmly behind Murkowski\u2019s bid. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who has made himself a national figure with a laissez-faire approach to the Covid-19 pandemic and willingness to embrace hot-button conservative causes, might be eyeing another office in a few years. But first, he needs to win a second term, with the possibility of a decisive victory likely to only spark further speculation about his ambitions beyond the Sunshine State. Three Democrats are hoping to derail DeSantis\u2019 rise, with US Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor, trying to reclaim his seat as Florida\u2019s chief executive. Crist leads the Democratic field in fundraising. The other contenders to take on DeSantis are state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and state Sen. Annette Taddeo. Before DeSantis, Sen. Marco Rubio was seen as the GOP\u2019s rising star in Florida. His failed 2016 presidential bid upended that trajectory and led Rubio to reverse course and seek reelection to the Senate. Now he\u2019s seeking a third term, with the onetime tea party darling turned Trump critic having fully embraced the former President amid Florida\u2019s shift to the right. US Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, is the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and has been a strong fundraiser. The outcome of these two races could dictate heading into 2024 how much attention and resources Democrats will deploy to Florida, which has been one of the premier battleground states in presidential races for many cycles. The decision by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to not seek a third term in deep-blue Massachusetts sets up another test of Trump\u2019s power inside the GOP. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl originally launched his campaign as a challenge to Baker and picked up Trump\u2019s endorsement. But while Diehl won\u2019t have the popular incumbent as an opponent, he also doesn\u2019t have a clear lane to November. Chris Doughty, a businessman and self-described moderate, joined the race in late January. While he doesn\u2019t have electoral experience like Diehl, Doughty was able to open his campaign with half a million dollars of his own money. On the Democratic side, state Attorney General Maura Healey, who entered the race after Baker declined to run again, leads the entire field in fundraising. State Sen. Sonia Chang-D\u00edaz is also running. Despite favoring Democrats at the federal level, Massachusetts has a habit of electing moderate Republican governors. Without Baker on the ballot, Democrats are hopeful they\u2019ll avoid such a fate this November. Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is one of the GOP\u2019s top targets in 2022, but the party\u2019s hopes of flipping the seat took a hit last November when popular Granite State Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a Senate bid. Sununu\u2019s decision sets up what could be a long and crowded GOP primary, given New Hampshire\u2019s late primary date. Candidates include former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse, who\u2019s received praise from McConnell. Redistricting is poised to make New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, more favorable for Republicans. That shift has attracted a wide field of GOP challengers, including Matt Mowers, who lost to Pappas in 2020, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and Gail Huff Brown, a former TV anchor and the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown. There will likely be another crowded primary on this day on the Democratic side in the Rhode Island governor\u2019s race. Then-Lt. Gov. Dan McKee was elevated to the top job when Gina Raimondo was appointed as Biden\u2019s commerce secretary last year, and he\u2019s now seeking a full term. But Rhode Island Democrats aren\u2019t just letting McKee have it. The packed field currently includes Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown and Helena Foulkes, a former executive at Rhode Island-based CVS.",

            "article_content": "Despite its Trump-loving crowd, the annual Conservative Political Action Conference became a venue this week for top Republicans to set themselves apart from each other and, in some cases, from the former President as they sharply condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin and his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some guest speakers \u2013 from Republican senators to senior Trump administration officials \u2013 accused Putin of tormenting Ukraine, forcing its people to flee their homes and splitting families apart. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve watched the images in the last 48 hours. \u2026 You have 70-something-year-old men, elderly women, younger children taking up arms \u2026 These are people that are basically saying, \u2018We refuse to be Putin\u2019s slaves. We refuse to live under tyranny,\u2019 \u201d Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida told the audience. Others demanded a US posture of peace through strength \u2013 littering their remarks with references to former President Ronald Reagan \u2013 or took aim at President Joe Biden, blaming his supposedly weak leadership for Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a Russian dictator now terrorize the Ukrainian people because America didn\u2019t demonstrate resolve that we did for the four years prior,\u201d said former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been laying the groundwork for a presidential run in 2024. \u201cIt was Reagan\u2019s model; it was the model that we used for four years in the Trump administration. We put America first and we told people around the world, you cannot tread on us,\u201d Pompeo added. Unlike his top diplomat, former President Donald Trump seemed to side with Putin in the lead up to Russia\u2019s military action. In the hours after Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine on Monday, Trump said of the authoritarian leader, \u201cThis is genius. Putin declares a big portion of Ukraine; Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that\u2019s wonderful. So, Putin is now saying it\u2019s independent \u2013 a large section of Ukraine. I said, \u2018How smart is that?\u2019\u201d Trump \u2013 who is scheduled to appear at CPAC on Saturday \u2013 then reportedly doubled down in a Wednesday night speech to Republican donors at his Mar-a-Lago estate, calling Putin \u201ctough\u201d while discussing the deadly situation in Ukraine, according to The Washington Post. The comment wasn\u2019t unusual for the former President, who would routinely compliment Russia\u2019s leader during his time in office and publicly sided with him over US intelligence officials during a stunning July 2018 press conference in Helsinki, where Putin denied any meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Matt Schlapp, a top Trump ally and chairman of the American Conservative Union, said in an interview with CNN that the former President \u201chas every right to opine\u201d when asked about Trump\u2019s glowing comments about Putin. Schlapp added that Trump built a coalition inside the Republican Party that is less likely to support the deployment of additional US resources to Europe to respond to Russia\u2019s aggression. \u201cI think there\u2019s a feeling like you got to tell us what\u2019s in America\u2019s interest and then we\u2019ll consider whether or not we support that. They want to be convinced it\u2019s in our national interest,\u201d Schlapp said. At times during this year\u2019s CPAC conference, the general audience reacted more viscerally \u2013 and vocally \u2013 to mentions of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been locked in a battle with truckers who are protesting Covid-19 vaccine mandates, than they did to Putin\u2019s name, even as civilians were being struck in Ukraine and US intelligence officials warned that the country\u2019s capital of Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days. While some elected Republicans danced around the topic entirely, perhaps the sharpest contrast came from two leading conservative commentators \u2013 both of whom have inhabited influential roles in Trump\u2019s orbit. K.T. McFarland, a former deputy national security adviser in the Trump White House, was unequivocal about the danger Putin poses to the West, warning CPAC attendees that Russia\u2019s cozy relationship with Beijing represents \u201cthe biggest threat to the US in our history.\u201d \u201cVladimir Putin doesn\u2019t stop with Ukraine,\u201d said McFarland, a regular guest on Fox News. But Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who is close to Trump\u2019s eldest son Donald Trump Jr., dismissed the European crisis as a distant problem, claiming that the influx of undocumented immigration across the US-Mexico border is a more pressing matter for the Biden administration to address. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear lectures about why we need to send our troops halfway across the world while we are being invaded,\u201d Kirk said. For his part, Biden has repeatedly opposed the deployment of US soldiers to Ukraine, though his administration has committed to mobilizing some forces already in the region and possibly sending additional troops to Germany. \u201cOur forces are not, and will not be, engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,\u201d Biden said. But at CPAC, where Republican presidential hopefuls traditionally test the waters with the party\u2019s most active voters, several contenders top GOP leaders used their brief moment in the spotlight to make a case against the siting president\u2019s capacity to lead. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, another rumored GOP presidential hopeful, called on Biden to take tougher action against the Putin regime during her appearance here. \u201cA strong American president would work with European partners to replace their supplies of Russian oil with American energy and they would hit Putin where it actually hurts \u2013 on the Russian energy sector,\u201d Noem said in a speech Friday. \u201cIf Joe Biden can\u2019t or won\u2019t do these things, then he should resign,\u201d she added to stifled applause from the crowd. Florida\u2019s Gov. Ron DeSantis, the early favorite for the Republican presidential nomination if Trump doesn\u2019t run again in 2024, omitted any mention of Ukraine in his opening day speech at the conservative gathering. DeSantis reserved his ire not for Putin and Russia, but for Western nations that have adopted strict measures to mitigate the coronavirus. He specifically called out Australia and Canada. \u201cThere are people that look to Florida as the citadel of freedom, who are chafing under authoritarian rule all across the world,\u201d DeSantis said, before reading aloud a letter he said was from an Australian fan. While many CPAC speakers avoided taking a position on Russia\u2019s aggression, those who did weigh in on the deadly crisis trained their criticism not on Putin but on Biden and his administration\u2019s energy policies \u2013 claiming that Biden has ignored US domestic energy resources and instead created increased dependency on outside nations and emboldened Putin, whose country\u2019s top export is oil. \u201cMr. President, have some confidence in the American people, show some strength to the world, open up American energy production full throttle \u2013 open it up right now. \u201cPut Americans back to work,\u201d said Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley in a speech Thursday afternoon, adding that he intended to introduce legislation to rescind regulations that have slowed fossil fuel extraction in the US and restart the Keystone XL oil pipeline connecting Canada to Gulf Coast refineries when he returned to Washington following his appearance at CPAC. In his own remarks, top Trump ally Ric Grenell blasted Biden for abandoning an \u201cAmerica First foreign policy\u201d that Grenell claimed was faithfully executed under Trump. \u201cWe must not let the Biden administration drag us back into the unsuccessful policies of the past and unnecessary wars,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "As Sarah Godlewski, a Wisconsin Democrat running for Senate, travels across her state speaking to Democratic voters, they are unnerved by the inaction in Congress. From shoring up voting rights to lowering prescription drug costs, they don\u2019t understand why Democrats, who control the House, Senate and the executive branch, can\u2019t advance policies they believe are popular. \u201cWhen you look at why we can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s because of the filibuster,\u201d Godlewski said in an interview. First used in the 1800s, the filibuster currently requires a 60-vote majority for most legislation to advance and pass in the Senate. The debate over the future of this procedural tool has become a lightning rod in American politics. Democrats\u2019 slim governing majority \u2013 held only thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tie-breaking vote in the 50-50 Senate \u2013 has proved detrimental to passing party priorities such as voting rights legislation and a sweeping social safety net and climate package. And eliminating the filibuster has now become a litmus test among Democratic hopefuls \u2013 up and down the ballot. How a group of senators in 1975 came up with a rule that changed the chamber forever Godlewski, who also serves as state treasurer, doesn\u2019t lead with filibuster reform on the campaign trail because, she said, Wisconsinites \u201cdon\u2019t care about the sausage making.\u201d But she knows how vital the issue has become in her party. \u201cI think it is hard to be a Democrat running and not be for getting rid of the filibuster,\u201d she said. Across the country, Democratic Senate candidates like Godlewski have doubled down on their support for scrapping or reforming the filibuster to advance legislation that is overwhelmingly popular with party voters. A recent explosion in campaign messaging tied to the issue shows it has become a potent tool for candidates courting both big and small donors. \u201cDemocrats can only step up to protect our democracy if we END the filibuster,\u201d read a campaign email last fall from Florida Rep. Val Demings, who has raised $20.7 million so far this cycle in her bid to unseat GOP Sen. Marco Rubio. Even more establishment-friendly groups, including a number with deep pockets and close ties to some of the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest donors, have taken hard positions on the filibuster. EMILY\u2019s List, which backs female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights, announced it would not back Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who opposes changing filibuster rules, so long as she maintains her stance. NARAL, another abortion rights group, has said it will not endorse any candidate who opposes a rules change. This sea change in Democratic politics happened slowly, and then seemingly all at once. In 2020, former President Barack Obama damned the filibuster as a \u201cJim Crow relic\u201d at a memorial for the late Georgia congressman and civil right icon John Lewis. And over the past year, as President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda hit the skids in Congress, frustrated grassroots activists and, crucially, party donors began to apply new pressure to candidates and elected leaders to pursue more aggressive tactics. Last month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer bulled ahead, with Biden\u2019s support, on a quixotic effort to change chamber rules and create a filibuster carve-out for the consideration of voting rights legislation. He secured the support of 48 of the 50 members of his caucus, with Sinema and West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin the lone, decisive holdouts. Predictably, no Republicans backed the move, killing the effort for now. Frustrations over these Senate maneuvers are playing out for many Democrats on the campaign trail. In Pennsylvania, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman has been a vocal advocate for scotching the filibuster as he bids for the state\u2019s open Senate seat. The people of the United States elected Chuck Schumer to be majority leader. But by default, you have [Senate GOP leader] Mitch McConnell as the shadow leader because they\u2019re stopping our agenda wholesale because of the filibuster. People understand that,\u201d Fetterman told CNN. \u201cThey may not be able to give you an in-depth history across the decades of it, but they understand that it is the one thing that is stopping us getting things done.\u201d Even Rep. Conor Lamb, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has compiled a moderate voting record in Congress and is also running for Senate, has joined the anti-filibuster chorus. \u201cRepublicans are abusing it to block voting rights and endanger our democracy \u2026 to block health care and child care and union protections,\u201d he said in a video earlier this year. Ohio Democratic Senate hopeful Morgan Harper said voters there have become savvy in their understanding of Senate procedure. The constant national news coverage of Democrats\u2019 slim majority in the upper chamber and how dependent it is on Manchin and Sinema has heightened awareness of the process, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a high level of voter frustration around this,\u201d Harper said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re over it. They\u2019re frustrated. They showed up. They voted for change, for results.\u201d Many Americans don't know what to make of the filibuster, polls find A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted last month found that 35% of US adults were in favor of ending the filibuster, 34% were opposed and 31% said they had not heard enough to form an opinion. The partisan differences were more stark: 58% of Democrats supported ditching the rule, while 65% of Republicans favored keeping it in place. Data for Progress, a progressive Democratic think tank and polling firm, has tracked the issue as it relates to voting rights for years. Its poll from July 2020 found 54% of all voters supported ending the filibuster to pass \u201ca new voting rights bill,\u201d with only 27% opposed. Majorities of Democrats and Republicans were in favor, with 65% and 51%, respectively, the survey found. But fast-forward to 18 months later, and a yawning partisan gap has opened up. According to January\u2019s Data for Progress poll, 81% of likely Democratic voters supported \u201cchanging this Senate procedure\u201d to pass the voting rights legislation that was blocked in the chamber last month. Only 26% of likely GOP voters felt the same. As Republican candidates race to embrace the so-called Big Lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 election, Democratic hopefuls seem to be checking a different box altogether, with most major candidates, from progressives in blue states to moderates in red or purple states, declaring their disdain for the Senate filibuster. That dynamic might well flip the next time Republicans achieve a governing trifecta, but for this campaign season at least, the incentive for Democrats trying to juice up a beaten-down base is clear. \u201cWhat we\u2019re actually talking about is clearing the path for legislation that\u2019s going to support the needs of working people throughout our country,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAnd the filibuster is a roadblock to doing that.\u201d The fight for filibuster reform among Democrats can be nuanced. While 48 senators voted for the voting rights carve-out last month, some like Nevada\u2019s Catherine Cortez Masto, Arizona\u2019s Mark Kelly and New Hampshire\u2019s Maggie Hassan, all vulnerable senators up for reelection this year, aren\u2019t in favor of scrapping the filibuster entirely. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee does not have an official position on the issue, and Manchin and Sinema, for all the furor over their votes against changing Senate rules, are not on the ballot again until 2024. DSCC Chair Gary Peters, a second-term senator from Michigan, downplayed disputes within his party\u2019s narrow majority, saying recently: \u201cI just continually tell our friends we need to stay focused on the next few months. There\u2019s just so much at stake going forward, with the Biden administration and things we care deeply about.\u201d McConnell, who has described Democratic attempts at filibuster reform as a \u201cgiant partisan power grab,\u201d removed the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in 2017, helping Trump get three justices confirmed. McConnell\u2019s move followed Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid\u2019s 2013 decision to scrap the filibuster for lower-court nominees. This is Harry Reid's biggest legacy McConnell did hold firm in refusing to eliminate the legislative filibuster in 2017 and 2018 when Republicans had full control of Washington, despite intense pressure from Trump to do so. Still, Democrats like Fetterman say that if \u2013 and when \u2013 the shoe is on the other foot and a potential GOP majority needs to remove the barrier to achieve a legislative goal, Republicans will change their tune. The filibuster \u201cis gonna be the first thing to go if they\u2019re in a position to run the table,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cWe will have allowed them to get there by not passing these kind of reforms that are so necessary right now.\u201d Progressive activist group Indivisible, which has emerged as a Democratic grassroots powerhouse over the past five years, began a project to educate its members and the public about the Senate filibuster and its consequences back in 2018, when Democrats stormed back into control of the House. Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, told CNN his group began to see a groundswell forming that year. Concerns over the future of democracy were stoked by Trump\u2019s presidency, he said, and soon became the top issue for local chapters. \u201cIt was above climate and above health care, above immigration,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThey cared about all those things, but their top issue was democracy itself.\u201d Indivisible leaders \u2013 with their intimate knowledge of congressional wonkery and the institution\u2019s inner workings \u2013 set about connecting that desire to the practical matter of the filibuster and the power it imbues to the minority party to block popular legislation. On the presidential primary trail in 2019, leading candidates were still only, at most, lukewarm on publicly endorsing an end to the filibuster. But with time, pressure and twin victories in Georgia at the beginning of 2021 delivering Democrats a surprise Senate majority, the balance has shifted. \u201cI would be shocked if a Democrat wins a primary in North Carolina or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin who does not support ending the filibuster,\u201d Levin said. \u201cNot just kind of in a squishy way, but in an affirmative, \u2018I\u2019m going to fundraise off of this\u2019 kind of way.\u201d That dramatic evolution has come out of necessity, a host of leading advocates insisted in a series of conversations with CNN. \u201cThe filibuster is an impediment to basically every priority Democrats have campaigned on for the last decade. We\u2019re seeing it with voting rights. We will likely see it with reproductive health protections,\u201d said Tr\u00e9 Easton, deputy director of the progressive communications firm Battle Born Collective. When asked if the politics of the filibuster could hurt vulnerable moderate Democrats in a general election, Easton argued that the filibuster currently advantages Republicans by letting them block legislation popular with most voters without facing any consequences. He suggested Democrats stand firm on the issue, even if challenged. \u201cIf you are able to articulate why you believe a thing, it\u2019s not a liability,\u201d Easton said. \u201cYou\u2019re actually just saying you understand you want democracy to function.\u201d That is the underlying message from Democratic candidates \u2013 and not just those running for Senate. New York Democrat Melanie D\u2019Arrigo is making a second run for the Long Island-based 3rd Congressional District, which Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi is vacating to run for governor. She said the anti-filibuster cause now resonates with Democratic voters \u201cacross the board.\u201d \u201cIf the question is, do people really care about the filibuster? I think the answer is probably no,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what people care about is solutions. People care about a government that addresses our problems. And unfortunately, we have a government unwilling to work together.\u201d Inaction on Biden\u2019s agenda, she added, would make her race \u2013 which Republicans are targeting \u2013 or any other Democrats\u2019 more difficult in November. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make our jobs [as candidates] significantly harder because voters will throw their hands up, and they will sit home. That\u2019s what I think will happen,\u201d D\u2019Arrigo said. \u201cNow, there are ways to combat that, and I think it starts by exciting the base and giving them something to vote for.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Henry Cuellar already faced a difficult rematch in the March 1 Democratic primary against the progressive challenger who nearly defeated him two years ago. Then the FBI showed up in January to search his home here in Laredo and the building that houses his campaign office. Though the details of the investigation remain murky as Texas prepares to kick off the 2022 midterm primary calendar with the year\u2019s first contests, Cuellar\u2019s challenger, 28-year-old immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, is seizing on the FBI probe in television advertisements and on the campaign trail. And progressives, sensing an opening to oust one of the House\u2019s most conservative Democrats in a left-leaning district that the party would be favored to hold in the November general election, have rallied to her side, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsing Cisneros and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning for her in Texas in recent days. Cisneros is facing a South Texas political institution in Cuellar, who served first in the state House starting in 1987, then, briefly, as Texas secretary of state in 2001 \u2013 appointed by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. He won his seat in Congress in 2004 by narrowly defeating a sitting Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, in the primary. But his relationships with Republicans, coziness with corporations and conservative-for-a-Democrat voting record have also angered powerful Democratic groups that have now aligned against him. EMILY\u2019s List, Planned Parenthood, labor unions like the Texas AFL-CIO and others have backed Cisneros. The Latino Victory Fund endorsed Cisneros earlier this month. Cisneros\u2019 campaign began a new 30-second television ad this month with 20 seconds of compiled news clips about the FBI investigation. Her allies are similarly pouncing: Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs her candidacy, launched its own spot highlighting the probe. \u201cAfter 36 years in politics, Cuellar has changed,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cIt really strengthens that message that we\u2019ve been talking about from the very beginning,\u201d Cisneros said in a recent interview at a Laredo coffee shop. \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been talking about in terms of corporate PACs, or Republican corporate interests having a corrupting influence on Cuellar\u2019s vote.\u201d Then there\u2019s the reality that the district lines have slightly shifted since 2020 as a result of redistricting. \u201cBeing raided by the FBI probably isn\u2019t a good first impression\u201d for voters who have not lived in Cuellar\u2019s district before, Cisneros said. The mounting opposition to Cuellar stems from his status as the most conservative Democrat in the House. He has long supported gun rights and the fossil fuel industry. He was part of a group of lawmakers who pushed congressional leadership to separate the legislative push for President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill from Biden\u2019s broader \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d agenda. Progressives had sought to tie the measures together to increase their chance of passage \u2013 and were ultimately proved right when the infrastructure bill passed while the Build Back Better Act collapsed. Most infuriating for many Democrats was Cuellar\u2019s September 2021 vote against the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act \u2014 which would codify abortion rights even if the Supreme Court reverses its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling. Cuellar was the only House Democrat to oppose the measure, which came after Texas state lawmakers had passed an anti-abortion law that is one of the most restrictive in the US and the developed world. \u201cThis race is, of course, important for Texas, but we\u2019re also looking at the last anti-abortion Democrat in the House,\u201d said Kelly Robinson, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \u201cThis is a race that everyone should be watching. What it is is indicative to what the future of the party looks like and what the future is for advocating for abortion rights.\u201d The race is also under the national eye because it is taking place in a region where Democrats were stunned by their shrinking margins of victory with Latino voters in the 2020 election. The poor performance in South Texas and South Florida, in particular, raised new questions about electability and the kinds of candidates Democrats should field in those districts. Even some of Cisneros\u2019 supporters say the conservative views of some Democratic-voting Latinos could carry Cuellar to victory. \u201cWith an FBI investigation looming, she has a better chance. But Laredo is very conservative,\u201d said Jorge Martinez, a 52-year-old retail manager and Cisneros supporter in Laredo who attended a recent campaign event here for her. \u201cI know we vote in blue, but our views are very conservative. So I think it\u2019s still going to be an uphill battle for her.\u201d Cisneros said it was clear long before Election Day 2020 that Democrats would underperform in South Texas. But she said it\u2019s not ideology but an electorate dissatisfied with those who have been representing them that is to blame. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that people are getting conservative all of a sudden,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s more so that people have this anti-incumbent sentiment at the top of the ticket where they\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019ve been voting Democrat for such a long time. I still can\u2019t make ends meet or I\u2019m struggling to make ends meet. I still don\u2019t have health insurance. We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic, things got even worse. I\u2019m seeing people die, right, all the time, because we are a Covid hotspot.\u2019 So to them, it was like, \u2018I need to try something new because the status quo isn\u2019t working for me.\u2019\u201d Whoever emerges out of the primary will be a target for Republicans looking to take back the US House this fall. Joe Biden would have carried the redrawn seat by 7 points in 2020, but GOP operatives see the district as ripe for a flip in the current political environment. Among the candidates vying for the Republican nomination are Sandra Whitten, the 2020 nominee who lost to Cuellar by 19 points, businessman and rancher Ed Cabrera and Air Force veteran Steven Fowler. Since the FBI search on January 19, Cuellar has kept a low profile in the 28th Congressional District, which stretches from the border city of Laredo to southeast San Antonio. He has refused to debate Cisneros ahead of the upcoming primary. And his campaign declined to make the congressman available for an interview with CNN. Spokesman James Sonneman said Cuellar has spent recent weekends phone-banking with volunteers, but did not have any public events. Many of Cuellar\u2019s previously vocal supporters either declined to comment or ignored interview requests, even if they had not backed away from him publicly after the FBI search. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which supports the party\u2019s House incumbents and to which Cuellar has long paid dues, declined to comment and is not playing an active role in the race. And the San Antonio Express-News, a major newspaper in the district that endorsed Cuellar in his 2020 primary against Cisneros, backed Cisneros this time around. Cuellar\u2019s campaign has largely relied on direct mail pieces and television ads to carry him in the wake of the FBI search. In late January, addressing the search for the first time, he released a video standing in front of the house he had grown up in \u2014 rather than the one searched by the FBI \u2014 saying that the investigation will show \u201cno wrongdoing on my part.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear: I\u2019m running for reelection, and I intend to win,\u201d Cuellar says in the video. Meanwhile, buoyed by the FBI search in a race that already looked close, progressives see a clear opening. Sanders endorsed Cisneros on Monday. His move came after Ocasio-Cortez visited Texas last weekend to campaign in Austin for Cisneros and Greg Casar, a progressive candidate in the Democratic primary for the nearby 35th Congressional District. Ocasio-Cortez compared Cuellar to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who has blocked Democratic agenda items in the Senate and refused to support changes to the filibuster in order to advance voting rights legislation. \u201cA lot of people say \u2018Manchin, Manchin, Manchin,\u2019\u201d the congresswoman said in Texas. \u201cBut we know it\u2019s not just Manchin. You know who\u2019s helping him? Henry Cuellar.\u201d Cuellar\u2019s campaign was dismissive of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s visit. \u201cThe voters will decide this election not far left celebrities who stand for defunding the police, open borders, eliminating oil & gas jobs, and raising taxes on hard working Texans,\u201d Cuellar\u2019s campaign said in a statement emailed to reporters by chief of staff Jake Hochberg ahead of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s visit. The race is in some ways reminiscent of the primary ouster of another anti-abortion Democrat, Rep. Dan Lipinski of Illinois, in 2020. Lipinski twice faced a progressive female challenger backed by a long roster of leading Democratic groups \u2014 first in 2018, when he narrowly survived against Marie Newman, then again in 2020, when Newman claimed victory. Cuellar survived his first matchup against Cisneros in 2020, winning by less than 4 percentage points. But Cisneros, much like Newman was, appears even better positioned for their rematch. Cuellar is \u201ca corporate Democrat, working hand in hand with oil and gas lobbyists when they\u2019re the ones creating things like the Texas freeze in that district,\u201d said Ellen Sciales, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, which is holding phone banks for Cisneros. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known that Cuellar is corrupt in some way. It didn\u2019t take an FBI investigation for us to notice that,\u201d Sciales said. Cuellar, though, has deeper alliances on Capitol Hill. He has raised millions for the Democratic Party and has long paid dues to the DCCC. He has also built bridges across the political aisle \u2013 at times infuriating Democrats. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican, told The Texas Tribune last year after the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm identified Cuellar\u2019s district as a target in the 2022 midterm elections that \u201cHenry Cuellar is my friend and he\u2019s my partner.\u201d \u201cThere are better targets than Congressman Cuellar,\u201d Cornyn said then. In 2020, Cuellar had vocal Democratic supporters, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who visited the district 10 days before his primary election against Cisneros. Since the FBI search, though, Cuellar\u2019s allies have largely been quiet. Jen Ramos, a member of the Texas Democratic Party\u2019s executive committee who supports Cisneros, said the challenger has the advantage of being much better-known now than she was ahead of the 2020 primary. \u201cThis time around, in 2022, Jessica has name ID,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cShe never really went away. She stayed involved in the community, has been really active in the district.\u201d Meanwhile, she said, Cuellar has not changed since 2020. \u201cFBI investigation aside, after electing Henry in a very public, very expensive primary election, Henry really had to kind of answer, what has changed? What has he learned? And really, the answer is he hasn\u2019t learned anything,\u201d Ramos said, pointing to Cuellar\u2019s votes against a pro-labor union measure known as the PRO Act and the abortion rights legislation. \u201cThese are consequences to real elections and real issues that constituents in the 28th District are paying attention to,\u201d she said. Ramos is not alone in her belief that Cuellar is growing out of touch with the Democratic Party in Laredo. \u201cWhat\u2019s left of the Boomers that blindly support Cuellar are fading, and the Boomers that consider themselves more moderate, like my dad, my uncles, my relatives, are listening to Gen Zers more,\u201d said Beatriz Mendoza, a deputy chair of the Democratic Party in Webb County, home to Laredo. \u201cGen Z and millennials are becoming more activated in politics and we are advocating within our families for more progressive candidates,\u201d she said. There is a third candidate in the primary race: Tannya Benavides, who is also from Laredo. While organizing with the No Border Wall coalition in South Texas, Benavides said she was constantly asked what her congressman was doing about the situation at the border. \u201cHe continuously voted to appropriate wall money, under the pretense that he didn\u2019t want a government shutdown. Time and again, I sat in these meetings with congressional delegates up and down the border. And the conversation always shifted to, \u2018Well, what is your congressman doing?\u2019 and \u2018What about Rep. Cuellar?\u2019 For me, it became clear that there\u2019s only so much you can do to organize. You can\u2019t out-organize around elected officials that don\u2019t have the political will to bring about change in their communities. And that is why I decided to launch my campaign.\u201d Benavides sought to position herself outside the progressive-versus-conservative frame through which many have viewed Cisneros and Cuellar. Pointing to Republican gains in the 2020 election among Latinos, particularly in South Texas, she said voters in the district should focus on electability. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve experienced just knocking on doors, there is a lot of voter apathy. Then you see something like your congressman being investigated by the FBI and that leads to even more disillusionment and disenfranchisement,\u201d Benavides said. \u201cWe cannot deny the red trend in South Texas,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reality is that for whatever reason, we have not been able to figure out what moves people to vote.\u201d",

            "article_content": "He might say he\u2019s the master of the art of the deal. But Donald Trump\u2019s real superpower is his talent for wriggling out of accountability after sailing close to the law and normal rules of politics, business and life in a way that would have destroyed most public figures long ago. However, after he bounced back following a lifetime of business bankruptcies, scandals and impeachments, it might soon be time to consider whether the ex-President\u2019s flair for impunity is starting to fail him after a string of legal defeats tightened a net of scrutiny around him. In the latest blow on Thursday, a judge in New York ruled that Trump and his eldest two children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, must sit for depositions in the New York attorney general\u2019s civil probe into their business practices. It was far from Trump\u2019s only recent rough day in court. While he appears to be slipping deeper into a legal swamp, some obvious caveats are in order. Pretty much everyone who has bet that Trump\u2019s run-ins with the law, truth and reality would doom his career have been proved wrong ever since his riotous entry into the 2016 presidential campaign. And his refusal to live by the rules that govern everyone else is, in fact, a key ingredient of his political appeal for millions of voters. Such followers see their own disdain for elites and authority reflected in his travails and crusades. Trump remains the dominant force in the Republican Party, even out of office. And, in all of the latest legal threats currently facing him, the former President is yet to be proved guilty. If his tough run of luck carries on, the legal protections offered by the presidency might convince Trump even more of the merits of another campaign as he sizes up 2024. But even his fortune might run out at some point, and he may find it harder to avoid the consequences of his political transgressions and alleged infringements of the law. Behind the scenes in Republican politics, the rising tides of scandal could crest into conversations about whether Trump is the ideal standard-bearer for the party going forward \u2013 at least when it comes to a critical general election audience in the vote-rich moderate suburbs. Already, some Republicans fear that Trump\u2019s obsession with his false claims that he was voted out of power illegally will overshadow a GOP midterm election campaign focusing on high inflation and gas prices, anger at school lockdowns and immigration. A recent CNN poll backed up the idea that Trump\u2019s appeal may not be as rock solid as it once was. Some 50% of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents to the survey conducted by SSRS said they wanted the GOP to nominate him again, while 49% wanted someone else. The more the ex-President gets dinged up, the more some of these voters might be open to a candidate who promises Trumpism without Trump. Former Trump White House communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin suggested Thursday on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d that if the ex-President\u2019s legal woes deepen, they will not go unnoticed among potential 2024 candidates. \u201cNot only is the retired former President watching this from Florida, but I would also note that potential 2024 Republican candidates, I believe, are paying very close attention to this,\u201d Farah Griffin said. \u201cThere are many people, gearing up \u2013 considering \u2013 to run. And they are looking for that lane of an opening where Trump is weakened. \u2026 If you are a Mike Pompeo or a Mike Pence, this opens a window to you if it goes further,\u201d she added. Still, there is a lot that can be fixed by the $122 million political war chest the former President has already amassed. And Trump would have to be grievously wounded politically and legally for a major Republican rising star to openly take him on in the 2024 primary. The ex-President will also profit from the conservative media\u2019s power to shape the perceptions of GOP base voters and to spread misinformation about the legal cases pending against him. The right-wing machine\u2019s zeal for Trump was underscored again this week by its willingness to hype his claims that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign spied on his White House and the Trump Organization. The allegations were the product of distortions of a cryptic legal filing by special counsel John Durham, who is investigating the origins of the FBI\u2019s Trump-Russia probe. Thursday\u2019s ruling, related to a civil investigation into the Trump Organization\u2019s finances by New York Attorney General Letitia James, crowns yet another rough patch for the ex-President. In a related development earlier in the week, his longtime accountants, Mazars, disowned a decade of financial documents they had prepared for him. Given that he is being investigated over claims he inflated his assets to get loans and underestimated their value for tax purposes, this looks like a very grave development for the former President. And he keeps having bad days in court. Thursday\u2019s ruling followed soon after the Supreme Court dashed Trump\u2019s bid to keep White House documents secret from the House investigation into the January 6 insurrection. His defeat raised the likelihood that the committee will be able to piece together a broad reconstruction of the Trump team\u2019s attempt to steal the election and prevent Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and the extent of its role in planning or inciting the insurrection. Yet again however, political dynamics in a deeply divided nation may end up shielding Trump from the worst damage from a damning final report by the committee. But his problems don\u2019t end in Washington. A judge in Georgia last month granted a district attorney\u2019s request for a special grand jury to investigate his pressure on local officials to overturn his 2020 election loss. And there are multiple other probes and legal investigations facing Trump. The Justice Department, for instance, is investigating a scheme to seat fake electors who backed him and his lies about voter fraud. He\u2019s also the target of several personal lawsuits, including by his niece Mary Trump over her inheritance and by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. For any normal person, one encounter with the law is cause for extreme stress and financial anxiety. Few people have ever faced the onslaught of accountability that Trump must now stare down. Yet the ex-President has lived his entire life in a vortex of scandal, controversy, legal mazes, risks of financial ruin and quarrels he has picked or from which he will never back down. Far from being beaten down by being pursued by legal and political scrutiny, Trump appears to gain strength from it, flipping attacks to create a cult of victimization around himself with which his voters identify. For example, when Mazars walked out on him, Trump issued a furious counterattack, making an unsubstantiated claim about his wealth \u2013 apparently around $6 billion \u2013 and portraying himself as the victim of a massive plot. He claimed Mazars walked because of the \u201cvicious intimidation\u201d attacks against him by New York legal authorities. \u201cThis crime against me is a continuation of a Witch Hunt the likes of which has never been seen in this Country before,\u201d wrote Trump, who has demagogued his legal troubles for political gain by suggesting that Black prosecutors pursuing him are racially motivated. The Trump playbook is playing out already after his latest setbacks. First, the ex-President\u2019s lawyers announced an immediate appeal. This is his right. But it is also consistent with his previous legal strategy of seeking to tie up the system in endless litigation to stave off the moment of truth. Trump, for example, went all the way to the Supreme Court in his failed quest to keep White House call logs, records and other documents from the January 6 committee. He has invoked what many experts view as outrageous claims of executive privilege to try to prevent the committee from talking to key witnesses. In 2020, Trump and his allies mounted scores of cases alleging electoral fraud \u2013 even though many were laughed out of court by judges. Ticking off another Trump tactic, those moves were rooted in his belief that any judgement against him is not based on law but on bias against him. And, in another tried-and-true tactic, Trump\u2019s team attacked the judge after Thursday\u2019s ruling. \u201cI am not surprised,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorney, Ronald Fischetti, said. \u201cI had no belief at all that we would win before this judge.\u201d \u201cWe lost before we argued,\u201d he added. \u201cI told my client that, so I had no hope whatsoever that this judge would give us the relief that we wanted.\u201d The former President\u2019s team argues that Trump is the innocent victim of a political vendetta led by Democrats like James, who are afraid of that he will reclaim the White House in the next presidential election. And his team warns that the effort to force his deposition during the civil lawsuit is a ploy to draw him into jeopardy in a separate criminal investigation being mounted by the Manhattan district attorney. But as part of her investigation, James has alleged numerous \u201cmisleading statements and omissions\u201d in tax submissions and financial statements used to obtain loans. A deposition by Trump would not only threaten to go deep inside the opaque world of the family business, it would also be a potentially legally hazardous exercise for a client with a reputation for exaggeration and an often-distant relationship with the truth. Trump and his children would have the option of pleading their Fifth Amendment rights to protect themselves against self-incrimination. But the encounter might provide some nervous moments for the lawyers charged with keeping him out of trouble. And more broadly, there is also the chance that a cascade of troublesome legal woes could soon begin to raise questions about his famed political impunity.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden often says America\u2019s best days are ahead. It just doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. A nation exhausted by a two-year pandemic, struggling against rising food and gas prices, driven to distraction by school closures and torn apart by a political schism that erupted into violence is far from at ease with itself. The sense of turmoil was captured in a new CNN/SSRS poll released Thursday that showed waning faith in US elections and found that most of the nearly 60% of Americans who disapprove of how Biden is handling his presidency were unable to name one single thing they like that he has done. \u201cHe\u2019s not Donald Trump. That\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d one despondent respondent said. Another answered: \u201cI really like his new cat, Willow Biden.\u201d Vulnerable Democrats feel inflation squeeze and call for more White House action Also on Thursday there was news that a key measure of inflation had climbed to a near-40-year high last month. Rising prices have a kind of strange magic that not only spooks voters, but also seeds the kind of political derangement in which extremists like former President Donald Trump can prosper. His assault on facts \u2013 aided by pliant right-wing media \u2013 has his fans yearning for his authoritarian return to power 13 months after he incited the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol. The country no longer has a common understanding of the truth, with 37% of Americans saying Biden did not legitimately win enough votes to be president, according to CNN\u2019s new poll. This foul national mood is primarily a disaster in the making for Democrats in November\u2019s midterm elections, but it\u2019s been a long time coming. The first two decades of this century have delivered morale-busting military defeats, a generational economic crisis and an age of political turmoil, including sweeping social and demographic change and an equally intense backlash. Rising violent crime rates are making a nation awash in guns feel less safe. Talk of a new civil war in some media outlets is overblown. But divided blocs of conservatives and liberals genuinely seem to believe that the other is determined to rip away their vision of America. A powerful force on the right is the idea that a country that is becoming more racially diverse (partly through immigration), more socially liberal on gender issues and more secular, is being stripped of its quintessential, White identity. Up-and-coming Republicans have seized on public health guidelines and masks, meanwhile, to conjure a wave of fury based on the notion that Americans\u2019 individual freedoms are being eroded. There\u2019s also angst on the left, where people are furious the Covid-19 pandemic was prolonged by vaccine holdouts. And there\u2019s rising alarm among liberals that a conservative Supreme Court, starting to make radical shifts on social, racial and other issues, is set on turning a cosmopolitan nation into an idealized right-wing version of the 1950s. Here's the *real* problem with Joe Biden's approval rating A Republican Party wielding the filibuster in the Senate, meanwhile, is thwarting Biden\u2019s power to rescue the country\u2019s democracy from a flurry of new laws in GOP-led states that make it harder to vote and easier to politicize election results. Trump has weaponized the nation\u2019s divides for his own political ends. His lie that the last election was stolen from him has captivated his followers and made Biden an illegitimate leader in the eyes of millions of people \u2013 an impression it will be impossible for the President to mend. The sense of national unease is being exacerbated by events abroad. The unipolar world led by America at the end of the 20th century has evolved into multiple challenges to US dominance from a rising China to a revanchist Russia that threatens the democratic world order. Their mission to destroy democracy is, remarkably, being aided by Trump acolytes inside the United States, in a scenario that would have been impossible to believe a few years ago. Much of this catalog of woes is impossible to quantify. But everyone sees the strain and emotional toll in their friends and families of a once-in-a-100-year public health crisis. Even if average new daily cases are currently on their way down, the pandemic will bequeath trauma that will take years to heal. Biden on Ukraine situation: 'Things could go crazy quickly' The psychological impact of the way America is feeling will be for history to describe. But it is having political consequences in real time. A grungy mood in a nation divided in multiple ways is translating to ever-diminishing confidence in political leaders and the system itself. It also helps to explain why a summer economic spurt, a dip in inflation and more legislative success on Capitol Hill are unlikely to rescue Biden\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe have to keep it going. And I think our best days are ahead of us,\u201d Biden said last month at an event highlighting a push to increase the semiconductor supply. But the President\u2019s attempt to buck up the national psyche and his own political prospects rang rather hollow. There has been some mystification in Washington as to why administration successes have not registered more. The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows following a bumper monthly jobs figure last week. America\u2019s economy is recovering more quickly than many other developed nations\u2019 after the pandemic. A huge vaccine rollout saved thousands of lives. A massive Covid-19 relief bill that passed early in Biden\u2019s presidency made significant reductions in child poverty. And while an audacious multitrillion-dollar climate and social spending bill is stalled in the Senate, Biden did what all of his recent predecessors had failed to do \u2013 pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill. But Biden is getting little credit, and CNN\u2019s latest polling is simply brutal for the President. Just 41% of those asked approve of the way Biden is handling his job. His approval rating on the economy has dropped to 37% \u2013 down 8 points since early December alone. Only 45% approve of his handling of the pandemic he was elected to end. When those who disdain Biden\u2019s overall performance were asked to name a single thing he\u2019d done that they approved of, 56% had nothing positive to say. \u201cI\u2019m hard pressed to think of a single thing he has done that benefits the country,\u201d wrote one respondent. CNN Poll: Most Biden detractors say he's done nothing they like since becoming president It is true that no modern president has faced the confluence of crises that Biden did when he was sworn in nearly 13 months ago. And any commander in chief might have struggled. But Biden has rarely reached the heights of empathy and rhetoric he showed in an inaugural address meant to bring the nation back together after the pandemonium of the Trump years. \u201cOur history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear and demonization have long torn us apart,\u201d Biden said after he was sworn in. A year on, the second half of that equation appears to be dominating the first, not least because of the pernicious influence of his predecessor, who seems to be plotting a 2024 comeback attempt. But Biden may also have done too little to rally the nation behind him. He lacks the steadying and sunny confidence of President Franklin Roosevelt, who piloted his nation through the great crises of the Great Depression and World War II. Some Americans also saw the ambition of Biden\u2019s social spending plan as a betrayal of the moderate image he had cultivated on the campaign trail. The pandemic\u2019s refusal to loosen its grip over the first year of his presidency hammered his reputation for competence. The US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which should have been a political winner, was instead a parable of presidential incompetence when it descended into bloody chaos. High inflation has been responsible for ending countless political careers in the last century, and the White House\u2019s repeatedly wrong comments downplaying the seriousness of price hikes for basic goods haven\u2019t helped. Biden has restored decency and decorum to the White House. But a President nearing 80 may lack the galvanizing power to inspire much younger Americans. And Biden admitted last month that he had not fully mastered the role of the presidency after decades in the US Senate. \u201cOne of the things that I do think that has been made clear to me \u2013 speaking of polling \u2013 is the public doesn\u2019t want me to be the \u2018President Senator.\u2019 They want me to be the President and let senators be senators,\u201d he said. So entrenched are America\u2019s divides that it\u2019s hard to see how Biden will get his approval rating up the 10 or 15 points or so that history suggests is a safer zone for the party of first-term presidents in midterm elections. Even sudden deliverance from Covid-19 and an economic spurt might not alter perceptions of a country in crisis, especially given the lack of a common national reality. The Republican Party is enabling Trump's politics of violence Given the circumstances, the midterm elections ought to be some of the easiest on record for Republicans hoping to win the Senate and the House of Representatives. But the party is tearing itself apart, split between lawmakers fully bought into Trump\u2019s personality cult \u2013 either by conviction or political cowardice \u2013 and an apparently smaller, more traditional bloc of conservatives. The feud erupted afresh this week when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized a Republican National Committee censure resolution that described the January 6 insurrection as \u201clegitimate political discourse.\u201d Trump and his acolytes quickly hit back, raising the possibility of internecine GOP strife that could detract from its midterm message and once again alienate the suburban voters who helped eject Trump from the presidency after a single term. The widespread appeasement of Trump and efforts by his partisans to whitewash the truth about the Capitol insurrection, which are being revealed by the House select committee, have raised questions of whether the GOP has now become an anti-democratic movement that sees violence as a legitimate form of political expression. Trump has, for instance, recently issued racially explicit threats against prosecutors probing his election-stealing efforts and his business empire. While he retains a hold over the party, the GOP\u2019s course only seems more certain to tear the country further apart. In previous eras, an election might have been seen as a cathartic device to ease divides and frustration. But the fury of recent months may have rendered that traditional, democratic balm less powerful. In the CNN poll, 56% of respondents said they have little or no confidence that elections reflect the will of the people and about half think it\u2019s likely that a future election will be overturned for partisan reasons.",

            "article_content": "Since Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott deployed thousands of personnel to the US-Mexico border, the operation has been slammed as overtly political and a waste of resources by Democratic lawmakers and even some of the National Guard members participating in the mission. Last March, Abbott, who\u2019s up for reelection, launched \u201cOperation Lone Star,\u201d citing a crisis at the US southern border. The operation \u2013 which leaned on resources from Texas Department of Public Safety and Texas National Guard \u2013 has swelled to more than 10,000 service members. The speed at which the operation launched and its scope has fueled frustrations internally and among veterans of the Guard. Multiple members of the Guard who are deployed as part of Operation Lone Star and spoke to CNN described long hours with little to do, poor planning, and a lack of mission \u2013 all of which, they say, are contributing to low morale among soldiers. Eight years. Three Presidents. And still no resolution on an asylum claim. \u201cAs military, people know the term hurry up and wait. This is just the biggest hurry up and wait I was a part of, and there\u2019s really no set, \u2018hey, we\u2019re doing this, or hey, go out and do this.\u2019 It\u2019s just, we\u2019re sitting around doing nothing,\u201d one soldier said. Last year, several Republican governors across the country sent state law enforcement officials to the US-Mexico border, giving each the opportunity to emphasize their fealty to former President Donald Trump while simultaneously lambasting President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. RELATED: CDC extends controversial Trump-era border policy despite opposition from Biden allies Abbott has been a vocal critic of the White House, pinning an increase of migrants at the border to Biden\u2019s immigration policies, although there were spikes during the Trump administration as well. Here in Del Rio, authorities faced a surge of migrants last September that resulted in thousands of people, primarily Haitians, waiting to be processed under a bridge and required a rush of resources. Since that crisis, border arrests have remained high. In December, US Border Patrol arrested more than 33,000 migrants in the Del Rio sector, up from the previous month, according to the latest available data, compared to just under 9,200 in December 2020 and 3,000 in December 2019. The National Guard, though, generally serves in a support role and notifies US Border Patrol if they encounter migrants, so that agents can pick them up. In Del Rio, Humvees are located along the border at observation points with soldiers assigned to them to monitor for activity, which can range depending on location. CDC extends controversial Trump-era border policy despite opposition from Biden allies \u201cThere\u2019s guys standing at our points doing nothing, so they don\u2019t really see a mission. They just see this as we\u2019re just used as political pawns for an election year,\u201d the soldier said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of soldiers down here break down. I\u2019ve seen just a lot of soldiers, like their attitudes have changed drastically,\u201d the soldier added. \u201cMorale has been definitely low and the mental health has been declining.\u201d Other common complaints reported to CNN included cramped quarters leading to Covid-19 outbreaks among soldiers, delayed paychecks, and lack of proper equipment. Retired Command Sgt. Major Jason Featherston, who was involved in initial planning of the operation and retired last year, argued it didn\u2019t have to be that way. \u201cWe want to have soldiers provide these specific sets of tasks down there, and then that those tasks be planned out properly,\u201d Featherston said. \u201cAnd to be honest with you, if this thing was planned properly, we wouldn\u2019t be sending soldiers down there with improper gear.\u201d Immigration court backlog nearly equals size of Philadelphia's population, study finds Those concerns bubbled up during a two-hour virtual town hall in mid-January where senior commanders fielded questions from deployed units. Among the issues raised were soldiers swapping out gear because there wasn\u2019t enough for each person, insufficient tools, living conditions, and a failure to pay soldiers on time, according to audio obtained by CNN. RELATED: Eight years. Three Presidents. And still no resolution on an asylum claim. The Texas Military Department said it\u2019s working on the issues raised, equipment and living conditions and is following Covid-19 protocols. As of Wednesday, approximately 2.5% of service members assigned to the operation have been impacted by Covid-19, according to the department. \u201cThe mission for the National Guard and Texas DPS has been clear from the beginning: deter and prevent immigrants from entering Texas illegally, including building barriers to achieve those goals, and to detain and arrest those who are violating Texas law,\u201d said Nan Tolson, a spokesperson for Abbott, in a statement. But the slate of problems has already taken a toll on deployed soldiers. \u201cIt made me lose faith in a lot of the stuff that I had faith in as far the military goes,\u201d another solider told CNN, citing frequently changing plans. \u201cMy frustrations are mostly at the state level. The lack of planning, general care about individuals on the ground,\u201d echoed another soldier deployed under Operation Lone Star. Val Verde County Sheriff Joe Martinez told CNN the mere presence of authorities is keeping residents of Del Rio, which falls under his jurisdiction, safe. \u201cIf their duty is to, you know, sit on at a post and make sure that nobody comes across and if somebody comes across, call Border Patrol, you know, so be it, I think it\u2019s needed,\u201d Martinez said. A large white tent has been mounted in the parking lot in front of the sheriff\u2019s office to serve as a processing center for migrants arrested by state authorities for criminal trespassing. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, more than 2,900 migrants have been arrested by state authorities for criminal trespassing as part of Operation Lone Star. A key tactic of Abbott\u2019s operation is arresting suspected undocumented immigrants for trespassing onto private property after crossing the border. CNN previously reported that hundreds of migrants, through their attorneys and court documents, claimed their constitutional rights are being violated under the effort Abbott spearheaded. 'Horrific tragedy' as scores of migrants killed in road accident When asked about Operation Lone Star, a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said the agency doesn\u2019t have a \u201ca role or partner in any way with Texas DPS on Operation Lone Star.\u201d Texas civil rights groups filed a federal discrimination complaint with the Justice Department in December about Operation Lone Star, calling it \u201cunlawful,\u201d \u201cxenophobic,\u201d and \u201cracist.\u201d Democratic members of Congress from Texas along with some of their colleagues, have also previously raised issues about the operation to the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, arguing the programs have led to violations of state laws and constitutional due process rights. And in January, lawmakers urged the Texas Military Department inspector general to launch an investigation into the department\u2019s actions related to Operation Lone Star. Among the concerns listed by lawmakers was a spate of deaths, first reported by the Army Times, connected to the operation. There have been four deaths of service members who were assigned to Operation Lone Star, according to the Texas Military Department. Two were suicides and two were non-mission, accidental firearm discharges. This week, the Texas Military Department announced a Texas National Guard soldier died in a non-mission-related incident in the town of Brackettville, which 30 miles from Del Rio. Texas sheriff under investigation for allegedly seizing money from undocumented immigrants The soldier \u2013 identified as Texas Army National Guard Spc.

            "article_content": "During an appearance on Fox Monday night, former UN Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was asked for her take on the ongoing fight between Donald Trump and Mike Pence over the 2020 election and its aftermath. Here\u2019s the key part of what she said: \u201cI will always say, I\u2019m not a fan of Republicans going after Republicans because the only ones that win when that happens are the Democrats and the media, and we have to keep our eyes on 2022.\u201d Which, OK. She\u2019s not wrong from a purely political standpoint. But she is also sort of missing the point \u2013 and, in so doing, minimizing exactly what\u2019s at stake here. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! We are not talking about a policy disagreement between Trump and Pence. This isn\u2019t about immigration or trade or education. At root, this fight is about the health of American democracy. Trump is saying that Pence was within his constitutional rights to reject some of the electors on January 6, 2021. Pence is saying that to do so would have been to ignore not just the Constitution, but also the will of the public, which elected Joe Biden. The stakes of that fight are massive. It\u2019s about protecting both free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power \u2013 two traits that sit at the heart of American democracy. And it\u2019s not a \u201creasonable people can disagree\u201d sort of issue. On one side are people who see that the Constitution gives the vice president a purely ceremonial role in the counting of the Electoral College votes. On the other side are those who would overrun that prescribed role in pursuit of furthering their own political interests. Haley is far from the only culprit here. Asked Monday about the Republican National Committee\u2019s decision to censure Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for their roles on the January 6 committee, Texas Sen. John Cornyn told CNN, \u201cI think Republicans ought to stop shooting at Republicans.\u201d Which, again, isn\u2019t wrong politically. The more Republicans fight amongst themselves, the less time they dedicate to shining a light on Biden and the Democrats. But it fundamentally misunderstands \u2013 and underestimates \u2013 what is going on here. The battle lines here are not Trump versus Pence or the RNC versus Cheney and Kinzinger. It\u2019s democracy versus an attempt to overthrow that democracy. Republicans \u2013 up to and including Haley \u2013 do a disservice to the fight for democracy when they paint the debate between Pence and Trump in standard political terms. This is about way more than just an internecine fight within the GOP.",

            "article_content": "The spread of conspiracy theories and disinformation is fueling the \u201cheightened threat\u201d environment in the United States, warns the latest national bulletin issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security. The terrorism bulletin is in part a response to recent events, including a hostage attack on a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, and threats directed at historically black colleges and universities, as well as a shift in Russian influence campaigns related to Ukraine. This bulletin \u201coutlines the key factors that have increased the volatility, unpredictability, and complexity of the current threat environment, and highlights resources for individuals and communities to stay safe,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. For example, supporters of foreign terrorist organizations have encouraged copycat attacks following the attack last month on the synagogue in Texas, the bulletin says. And ISIS or its affiliates \u201cmay issue public calls for retaliation due to the strike that recently killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi,\u201d according to the bulletin. The National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin is the principal way DHS informs the public about any changes to the terrorism landscape in the US. The last one, issued in November, was set to expire this week. Threats against the United States are increasingly unpredictable and complex amid a host of conspiracy theories, foreign interference and calls for violence, the new DHS bulletin says. Although Russia is not named in the bulletin, a senior DHS official said it is \u201cone of those foreign hostile powers that has engaged in a sustained level of information influence operations targeting the US.\u201d Those efforts have in part been aimed at undermining credibility in the US government, the official added. Russia has promoted content through various means to US populations, particularly focusing on government response to Covid-19 and issues of race and immigration, as well as the 2020 election, according to the official. However, in recent months Russia has included messaging about Ukraine, according to a law enforcement source and a DHS memo that was shared with state and local officials in late January. Since September, Russia has also promoted narratives pointing to the US as the aggressor that is exacerbating the situation between Russia and Ukraine, according to the source. \u201cThis campaign constitutes the most significant Kremlin-driven messaging campaign in the last year and we expect this to continue to increase as the crisis over Ukraine worsens,\u201d reads the memo, obtained by CNN. What stands out in Monday\u2019s bulletin, according to Thomas Warrick, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Future of DHS Project, is the emphasis on false and misleading narratives and conspiracy theories, originating with or amplified by foreign and domestic threat actors. \u201cMost notable in recent months have been Russian disinformation efforts relating to Ukraine,\u201d he said, adding that DHS and US intelligence officials have previously pointed to state actors Russia, China and Iran, as well as terrorist groups, for their efforts to mislead and confuse the US public. \u201cWhat is most important, as the DHS NTAS Bulletin advises, is for the American people to recognize that hostile nation-states and terrorist groups alike are trying to mislead the American people on a wide range of issues,\u201d he said. Last month, a 44-year-old British national held four people hostage at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas. All the hostages escaped and the attacker was killed after an hours-long standoff that prompted federal government outreach to Jewish communities across the US. The synagogue attack highlights the continuing threat of violence based on racial or religious motivations, as well as threats against faith-based organizations, the bulletin says. US officials prepare for potential Russian cyberattacks as Ukraine standoff continues During and after Colleyville, DHS began seeing content posted online pointing to the attack \u201cas an example of the types of activities that lone offenders or others should be taking \u2026 in support of ISIS or al Qaeda,\u201d the senior DHS official said. There was also an increase in calls for attacks among those who are supportive of Aafia Siddiqui, an al Qaeda operative who is in custody in Texas, and the hostage taker referenced, according to the official. Investigators believe the hostage taker may have been motivated by a desire to release Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year sentence, CNN previously reported. \u201cIronically,\u201d the official said, there have also been calls on White supremacist platforms \u201cnoting the events in Colleyville.\u201d The primary terrorism threat to the US continues to be from lone offenders or small groups who are motivated by a range of foreign and domestic grievances \u201coften cultivated through the consumption of certain online content,\u201d the bulletin says. Both the Colleyville incident and the threats against universities and colleges are examples of continued calls for violence directed at US critical infrastructure, mass gatherings, faith-based institutions, institutions of higher education, racial and religious minorities, government facilities and personnel, and perceived ideological opponents, according to the bulletin. To combat the threats, DHS has been sharing information and intelligence with state and local officials, as well as impacted communities. While we are \u201cvery concerned about a threat environment,\u201d the DHS official said, \u201cI feel that we are much better prepared to deal with that threat as it is evolving than we were, say, a year ago.\u201d Mayorkas has called for a \u201csignificant enhancement\u201d in the funding allocated for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which provides money to organizations to invest in physical security enhancements, for example, another DHS official said. The synagogue in Colleyville was a recipient of one of these grants. This story has been updated with further details. CNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is still waging his hopeless fight to win the last White House race. But his possible heir apparent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, already seems to be trying to triumph in the next one. The former President\u2019s increasingly fantastical obsession with an election that he lost shows his determination to pin the Republican Party\u2019s future on a personal quest for vengeance that would restore his tarnished self-image as a winner. But DeSantis is directly engaging President Joe Biden, who plans to run for reelection, on multiple fronts that send an electric political charge through the GOP base. Internal documents show heated back-and-forth between DeSantis and Biden admin over care of migrant children Trump was most recently seen on conservative network Newsmax, downplaying the January 6, 2021, insurrection and insisting, falsely, that ex-Vice President Mike Pence could have made him president again. At the same time, DeSantis was opening a direct front against Biden on immigration \u2013 an issue that fired up Trump\u2019s first campaign \u2013 and lacerating Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has become a favorite target of conservative media. Sure, the 2024 election is still a ways away, and the rightward march of the GOP risks damaging all of its candidates with a broader electorate. And Trump still appears to have the next Republican primary by a stranglehold. The noncommittal responses from Republican senators asked whether they\u2019d back him in 2024 after his vow to pardon Capitol insurrectionists was proof of that. As was news that the former President has a $122 million campaign war chest. And a possible new Republican House run by Trump\u2019s henchmen and women after the midterm elections would give him real access to power and a vehicle for vengeance. But successful candidates position themselves well ahead of time to take advantage of future openings. All a potential GOP presidential hopeful can do now is prepare for a post-Trump era, if it happens. And DeSantis is using his flair for leveraging his official role as governor and his reelection race to pick fights on issues that matter to Trump voters, to saturate conservative media and to emerge as the dominant potential 2024 Republican not named Trump. If the ex-President stumbles, decides not to run or becomes embroiled in his own legal troubles, DeSantis is already presenting himself as an alternative. And in some ways, their shadow boxing is offering the first sign of a fork in the road for the Republican Party. With Trump, activists can get a relitigation of an election that would then be four years in the past and the promise to use a second term to wreak havoc on the political, legal and foreign policy elites that thwarted him in his first term. There are few signs of new policies or approaches that might look to the future. Florida bill aims to overhaul state election laws -- including proposal for election police force DeSantis, however, offers all the ideological and culture war ammunition that Trump would bring without the bellyaching about 2020, although he has proposed Trump-inspired ideas about voting restrictions and an election police. He\u2019d be a lightning conductor for conservative fury over undocumented migrants, the teaching of race in schools, transgender athletes playing on sports teams and the perceived crushing of freedoms by Covid-19 restrictions. And he\u2019d have a governing record on all of them. Trump retains fierce support in the heartland \u2013 the number of signs bearing his name alongside major highways and homes remains remarkable testimony to the connection forged by the former President. But it\u2019s not a given that all of those voters, while still viewing Trump with affection, will necessarily want to see him mount a third presidential bid. An NBC poll last month for, instance, showed that there are now more Republicans who consider themselves GOP voters than Trump voters \u2013 in a steady decline in the former President\u2019s standing. DeSantis is at the head of a group of Republican governors who have used their prominence in the pandemic to oppose federal health guidelines like masks in schools, vaccine mandates and societal shutdowns and to pour skepticism on epidemiological science. Others, like Govs. Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Greg Abbott of Texas, also handled the pandemic well in the eyes of conservative media \u2013 even if their policies raised the risk of infection, hospitalization and death in red states where people are more likely to die of Covid-19 than in places that voted for Biden in 2020. DeSantis has maneuvered himself into a solid political position. If he judges that Trump is too strong to oppose in the 2024 primary, he has the luxury of a gubernatorial term that will run through 2026, assuming he wins what is looking like a manageable reelection in November. That would allow him a plausible excuse to skip a race if Trump is in the field, and to play the long game ahead of a possible White House run in 2028 or later. If Trump\u2019s growing extremism results in increasing skepticism about his prospects in a general election or if he destroys his own brand or is unable to run for another reason, DeSantis will be in pole position for the Republican primary. It is no coincidence that the former President has begun to turn on a governor he once considered a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Last month, Trump said that political leaders who refused to say whether they had received a Covid-19 booster were \u201cgutless,\u201d in a clear shot at the Florida governor who has dodged the question. DeSantis forced himself into the national political conversation again in recent days with his latest assault on Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious diseases specialist who has become an avatar for conservative fury over government pandemic guidelines. The governor is selling flip flops on his campaign website that bear the slogan \u201cFauci Can Pound Sand\u201d on the soles. The eye-catching stunt is his latest shot at an internationally respected expert who has battled Covid-19 in the Trump and Biden administrations and fought epidemics worldwide since taking the helm of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases during the Reagan administration. Previously, DeSantis condemned \u201cFaucism\u201d and accused the veteran official of covering up for China on the origins of the pandemic. Fauci\u2019s treatment reflects the evolution of the Republican Party itself. It was only 14 years ago that he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-President George W. Bush for saving millions of lives in the developed and developing world, especially in Bush\u2019s HIV/AIDS relief program. But now he\u2019s a symbol of the establishment elites that the GOP base abhors and an easy target for up-and-coming political hopefuls. He needs a security detail and has said his family faces intimidation. 'Fauci Can Pound Sand': DeSantis takes on Dr. Fauci in reelection messaging DeSantis, meanwhile, is building the kind of resume that glows in Republican primary debates. In his time as governor, he\u2019s battled teachers unions over mask mandates, elevated officials who question federal public health guidelines based on science and banned transgender girls and women from playing on girls and women\u2019s sports teams in public school. He\u2019s introduced legislation that critics say could infringe the right to protest and announced proposals to stop critical race theory being taught in schools. Each one of these issues connects directly with the base, and is one reason why he\u2019s drawing presidential speculation. The Florida governor is also making a name for himself on an issue guaranteed to fire up GOP voters \u2013 immigration. CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez on Wednesday reported that DeSantis was threatening to keep long-standing shelters in his state from caring for migrant children, in a move that triggered a showdown with the Biden White House. The children, who arrived at the US-Mexico border alone, are in government custody and remain in shelters until they can be reunited with a vetted sponsor, like a parent or relative, in the United States. But in a letter sent to the Health and Human Services Department last week, and obtained by CNN, Florida\u2019s general counsel alleged the federal government was participating in a \u201chuman trafficking scheme.\u201d DeSantis also grabbed a national spotlight earlier this week, when he lashed out at critics who complained he was slow to condemn a small group of protesters who waved Nazi flags and chanted anti-Semitic slogans near Orlando last weekend. He accused his foes of trying to \u201csmear me as if I had something to do with it,\u201d said Florida law enforcement always stood with the Jewish community and spun the episode into a line sure to explode on conservative social media. \u201cI\u2019m not going to have people try to smear me that belong to a political party that has elevated anti-Semites to the halls of Congress, like (US Rep.) Ilhan Omar, that have played footsie with the (boycott Israel) movement,\u201d he said. Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, apologized in 2019 after she had been accused of using anti-Semitic tropes in public statements she had made criticizing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying organization. His swift pivot \u2013 from defense to an attack that nailed a culture war angle and referenced one of the conservative movement\u2019s favorite targets \u2013 was purely Trumpian. And it\u2019s once reason why DeSantis is getting so much notice as thoughts turn to the next GOP presidential race.",

            "article_content": "Late last week, the FBI conducted a \u201ccourt-authorized\u201d search of Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar\u2019s home and campaign office. But, why? That\u2019s the $25,000 question \u2013 and one I put to the Houston Chronicle\u2019s Ben Wermund, who has been reporting on the story of late. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Prior to the FBI coming to Cuellar\u2019s house and campaign HQ last week, did we have any sense that Cuellar was on the radar of the Justice Department? Wermund: No, the searches last week were seemingly out of nowhere, and everyone I have talked to while reporting on this was surprised by the news. Cuellar is a big figure in Texas, and in DC. He\u2019s one of the most senior members of the Texas delegation, now in his 17th year in Congress. He has a seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee and serves as a chief deputy whip, as well. Cillizza: You reported that Cuellar has ties to a businessman with ties to Azerbaijan. Why is this important? Wermund: The investigation Cuellar is tied up in is reportedly connected to a wide-ranging federal probe relating to Azerbaijan, a former Soviet state in eastern Europe, and several US businessmen. Few details are known about the ongoing FBI investigation, but Cuellar has long ties to Kemal Oksuz, a former Houston-based businessman who was convicted of lying to Congress about Azerbaijan\u2019s role in funding a 2013 trip to the Eastern European nation for 10 lawmakers (Cuellar was not one of them). Cillizza: What has Cuellar said about all of this? Or is he not talking? Wermund: Cuellar has mostly been quiet since the FBI searches last Wednesday. His office issued a statement that night saying he was fully cooperating with the investigation. They have not responded to other requests since. Cuellar made his first public appearance since the searches on Friday. He appeared via Zoom to accept an award from Democrats for Life of America. He did not talk about the FBI case during the appearance. Cillizza: What impact \u2013 if any \u2013 has this controversy had on Cuellar\u2019s reelection prospects this November? Wermund: The FBI investigation comes just as Cuellar\u2019s reelection campaign was heating up, with early voting set to start in just a few weeks in a Democratic primary rematch with Jessica Cisneros, a progressive immigration attorney who came within 3 percentage points of unseating Cuellar in 2020. Tannya Benavides, a former teacher and political organizer based in Laredo, has joined this year\u2019s primary race, as well, inspired in part by the success Cisneros saw in 2020. Cisneros has so far opted to not use the FBI investigation against Cuellar, only issuing a statement last week that she is watching it closely. Her campaign made a bigger deal about Cuellar appearing at [an] anti-abortion rally on Friday. Benavides issued a similar statement last week, saying, \u201cWe have an opportunity with this election to start a new chapter for South Texas.\u201d Cuellar\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, launched a new TV ad over the weekend depicting Cuellar\u2019s roots as one of eight children working alongside their parents in \u2018las piscas,\u2019 or the fields. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cIn January 2023, the member of Congress representing Laredo will be ____________.\u201d Now, explain. Wermund: At this point, the March 1 primary is the race to watch. The district has long been solidly blue \u2013 Cuellar won the 2020 general election by nearly 20 points \u2013 and it was just redrawn to be a bit more Democratic. That said, Cuellar \u2013 one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress \u2013 has argued that it\u2019s actually more of a swing district and has stayed blue because of his moderate politics. The GOP is also set to compete there in a way they haven\u2019t in the past after Republicans made some surprising gains in South Texas during the 2020 elections. Seven Republicans are vying to take on Cuellar in the Republican primary, and the National Republican Congressional Committee has targeted him.",

            "article_content": "Republican Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, a doctor who formerly served as White House physician to presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, made a sensational claim this past weekend about undocumented immigrants. \u201cIn 2022, illegal immigrants will have MORE FREEDOMS and easier access to healthcare and ballot boxes than most Americans\u2026 Just think about that,\u201d Jackson, who has more than 190,000 Twitter followers, tweeted on Sunday. CNN researched his claims in detail. They are not even close to true. Facts First: Jackson was thoroughly incorrect. Undocumented immigrants are prohibited from voting in all federal elections, all state elections and almost all local elections; the vast majority of citizens have the right to vote in all three. And undocumented immigrants, unlike citizens, are prohibited from receiving health insurance coverage from Medicare, Medicaid (with the exception of emergency Medicaid), the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (though some states use CHIP to cover prenatal care for all) and Affordable Care Act exchanges. \u201cRep. Jackson\u2019s statement is wildly inaccurate,\u201d San Francisco State University political science professor Ron Hayduk, who studies political participation and immigration and wrote a book on noncitizen voting, said in an email. Hayduk added: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what world Rep. Jackson lives in but it surely is not in the real world of the U.S. and its 50 states, even accounting for variations among states. The facts are clear and indisputable.\u201d Jackson\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. As of Thursday, his tweet had generated more than 3,100 retweets. CNN won\u2019t try to fact check Jackson\u2019s extremely vague claim that undocumented immigrants will have \u201cMORE FREEDOMS\u201d than most Americans in 2022. But let\u2019s go through his claims that undocumented immigrants will have easier access than citizens to ballot boxes and to health care. Jackson\u2019s claim about undocumented immigrants having easier access to \u201cballot boxes\u201d this year than most American citizens is completely false. Like other noncitizens \u2013 from visitors on short-term visas to permanent residents with green cards \u2013 undocumented immigrants can\u2019t vote in federal elections such as the congressional midterms of 2022. And like other noncitizens, undocumented immigrants can\u2019t vote in state elections such as the 36 elections for state governor in 2022. There are a small number of communities \u2013 15 cities and towns in total, according to Hayduk \u2013 in which at least some noncitizens can legally vote in at least some local elections. In San Francisco, noncitizens including undocumented immigrants can vote in school board elections and school board recall elections if they have a child under age 19 who lives in the city. New York City just passed a law that gives certain noncitizens the right to vote in municipal elections including the mayoral election; New York City\u2019s list of eligible noncitizens includes \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2013 undocumented people who arrived in the US as children \u2013 who have obtained work authorization through the federal DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, but not the entire undocumented population. Jackson\u2019s claim would have been wrong even if it was specifically about New York City and San Francisco. Undocumented residents there do not have \u201ceasier\u201d access to ballot boxes than most citizens. Rather, in a limited set of elections, some undocumented residents there have the same access as most citizens. Undocumented immigrants have some access to health care. In general, however, they have significantly less access than American citizens do \u2013 though, of course, many citizens face their own challenges dealing with a US system that is consistently ranked as less accessible than the systems of other wealthy countries. Unlike citizens, undocumented immigrants are \u201cbasically excluded from participation in all federal health programs,\u201d said Samantha Artiga, director of the racial equity and health policy program at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies US health care. As noted above, that means undocumented immigrants are denied access to Medicare, to Medicaid except for very limited emergency coverage, to the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program with the exception of pregnancy care in some states, and to Affordable Care Act exchanges. Undocumented immigrants are not only prohibited from purchasing subsidized insurance through these exchanges but even from using the exchanges to buy insurance at full price. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported that in 2019, 46% of undocumented immigrants were uninsured, compared to 9% of citizens. \u201cAnd people who are uninsured go with less health care,\u201d Artiga said. \u201cThey face more barriers to accessing health care because of financial barriers.\u201d Even when undocumented people do have access to health services, she added, some are reluctant to access them because they fear immigration consequences. There are various ways that undocumented immigrants do receive health care. Some get private insurance through employers. Uninsured people can get some low-cost care at community health centers. Some undocumented immigrants rely on hospital emergency departments, which are legally required to treat anyone who shows up, though these patients can get stuck with substantial bills. In addition, there are publicly funded coverage options for some undocumented people in some parts of the country. For example, six states and Washington, DC, use their own funds to provide health insurance to children from households below certain income levels regardless of immigration status. California is poised to expand coverage to its entire low-income population including undocumented people. But even in a state like California, undocumented immigrants would not have \u201ceasier access\u201d to health care than most citizens do. At most, undocumented residents would be granted equivalent access.",

            "article_content": "A proposal to vaccinate migrants that was a source of tension inside the White House last year is back on the table as the Biden administration tries to change the way the United States deals with migrants at the southern border. In August, when a report on the proposal emerged, top White House officials, including chief of staff Ron Klain, tried to seek reassurance that in fact the plan wasn\u2019t happening. Klain and Susan Rice, one of President Joe Biden\u2019s top aides, shot down the proposal \u2013 intended to address public health concerns \u2013 because they thought it would encourage more people to come to the US, sources tell CNN. Fact check: A look at Biden's first year in false claims Migrants being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and minors in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services were already being offered vaccinations. But the proposal \u2013 reported in The Washington Post last summer \u2013 would apply to migrants encountered at the US southern border and released in the US as they await court hearings. The plan, which originated at the Department of Homeland Security, is before the White House again, but no decision has been made, according to a senior administration official. A White House spokesperson disputed the account about Klain and Rice, saying that \u201ca decision on vaccinations for migrants had not been made at the time, just as a decision hasn\u2019t been made right now.\u201d \u201cWe have put in place public health protocols that prioritize the health of border communities, agents and migrants. We are always evaluating potential updates to the protocols,\u201d the spokesperson said. Vice President Harris will visit Honduras for inauguration of Xiomara Castro Biden administration officials are trying to reset and resurface plans to rework how the US handles migrants at the US-Mexico border, following a year of record arrests and fierce political backlash. But the issues and political concerns that vexed the administration over the last year are likely to persist. Biden outlined ambitious goals during his first days in office to repeal the hardline policies of his predecessor, overhaul the US immigration system and create a better, more humane system at the southern border. And his administration has made inroads on several fronts. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, recorded nearly 300 executive actions taken on immigration as of January 19, 2022. The US-Mexico border, though, often gains the most attention, and there the administration has juggled executing on progressive objectives with worrying over optics as Republicans seized on the issue as an example of poor management. In recognition of increased migration to the US, Biden tapped Vice President Kamala Harris, who\u2019s expected to travel to Honduras next week, to address the root causes of migration \u2013 an intractable issue that\u2019s dogged administrations for years and takes time to yield results. Internally, the back-and-forth pits camps of officials against each other: those who wanted to take a more progressive position and others operating under a model of deterring migrants, which has long been a US position. Biden leaves Democrats hanging as midterms burst into full swing A slew of Biden appointees who had been heralded by immigrant advocates and assigned to immigration have departed \u2013 or plan to depart \u2013 the administration, including figures like Andrea Flores, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who\u2019s since joined New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s office, Tyler Moran and Esther Olavarria, who\u2019s retiring. One source familiar with internal discussions described the arrival of thousands of unaccompanied children just weeks into Biden\u2019s presidency as a \u201cbig political bruise\u201d that stalled plans to overhaul the system at the border. Instead, as border arrests climbed, discussions about the return of a Trump-era border policy requiring non-Mexican migrants to stay in Mexico \u2013 a program condemned by Biden on the campaign trail \u2013 began to ramp up inside the White House, the source said. A lower court later required the policy\u2019s revival. Administration officials have conceded that progress on building out a new system on the US-Mexico border has been a challenge. \u201cThere is still significant work underway. It has been a challenge. It has been frustrating to all of us inside and personally to me,\u201d Olavarria, the White House\u2019s deputy director for immigration, said during a Migration Policy Institute event this week, citing in part the unprecedented surge of migrant minors early in the administration. \u201cThere\u2019s much more that we need to be doing and could be doing,\u201d she added. \u201cThe building blocks for that are also underway.\u201d The whiplash of the last year, sources say, stems in part from record border apprehensions, which are often used as a barometer of success for administrations. The growing number of migrants at the US-Mexico border, which is reflected in border arrest figures, angered Klain, according to the source, who called meetings on the matter with the chief of staff tense. A White House spokesperson said \u201cno one was angered,\u201d adding that the administration knows irregular migration is a challenge. The spokesperson also maintained the administration is committed \u201cto building a fair, humane and lawful immigration system\u201d and providing access to asylum and other legal migration pathways to those seeking protection. A senior administration official told CNN that officials are now weighing proposals to chart a new path on the US-Mexico border, focusing on the use of new technologies to make asylum more accessible and evaluating models used by the United Nations to receive migrants. But that remains contingent on the end of a Trump-era public health order that has effectively barred migrants from seeking asylum \u2013 an authority the Biden Justice Department defended in court Wednesday. Administration officials say they\u2019re focused on developing a plan for when that happens. Previous administrations have similarly faced challenges on the US southern border as conditions in the Western Hemisphere have deteriorated. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated those conditions, forcing the Biden administration to contend with even larger number of migrants \u2013 many of whom are claiming asylum \u2013 at the border. \u201cThe way the President views this is that we are facing something historic in the Western Hemisphere. We\u2019ve never seen displacement at this scale,\u201d another senior administration told CNN. A recent report from the International Organization for Migration, part of the United Nations, found that the pandemic impacted migration from Central and South America, spurring movement across the region. Data collected by US Customs and Border Protection also revealed an increase of South Americans crossing the US-Mexico border. Biden acknowledged the state of the region during a nearly two-hour news conference Wednesday, saying he\u2019s in contact with the leaders of the countries in South America and working closely with them \u201cto deal with helping the countries in question.\u201d He also nodded to the plight of people who choose to leave their home countries. \u201cPeople leave because they have real problems,\u201d he said. Civil rights leaders keep pressure on voting rights in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy Harris, meanwhile, has announced private investments in the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, and administration officials are considering a potential regional compact spanning countries in Central and South America to promote coordination on stemming the flow of migration and work to stabilize the region. But the results of those initiatives take time, leaving the focus on the border. The senior administration official maintained that improving asylum at the US southern border remains a \u201ctop priority\u201d for Biden. \u201cWe want to create a system that\u2019s quick, that\u2019s transparent, that people can register and have an appointment quickly and have their claims heard. Easier said than done, but that\u2019s the goal,\u201d the official said, referring to asylum claims. \u201cIf we were to create something that makes sense, that people know how to access it, that they don\u2019t have to wait in line for very long, we think that would be more attractive to many people than crossing through the desert,\u201d the official said, adding that there\u2019s a lot of planning going on behind the scenes to bring that to fruition, including also entertaining reception models like those used by the United Nations abroad. A regulation initially proposed last year that provides asylum officers more authority by allowing them to hear and decide claims is also expected soon, according to Olavarria. The rule would overhaul the asylum system in an attempt to settle claims faster and help alleviate the immigration court backlog. Immigration judges currently decide asylum claims. First, however, comes winding down a public health authority, known as Title 42, that allows the expulsion of migrants encountered at the border and effectively bars asylum. The White House has declined to say when that might end, punting to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And on Wednesday, the Biden administration defended the use of the authority \u2013 which has resulted in more than 1 million expulsions of migrants \u2013 in court. Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments before a federal appeals court put into focus the border conundrum facing the administration: trying to defend a controversial policy that pushes people back into Mexico, while recognizing the dangers of doing so in another lawsuit. Judge Justin Walker cited what he called a \u201cself-contradiction,\u201d noting that in a case concerning the Trump-era \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy, which forces non-Mexican migrants to stay in Mexico until their US court dates, the Justice Department says migrants face persecution, abuse and other harms. (The Biden administration tried to terminate the program, but a court order required it to be re-implemented.) But in the Title 42 case, the Justice Department defended expelling migrants to Mexico. \u201cWhat are we supposed to do with this?\u201d Walker asked the Justice Department attorney. Immigrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers have posed similar questions to the administration. Revamping systems at the US-Mexico border, though, will likely require additional funds and as a result, sign-off from Congress, where both parties have been deeply divided on immigration and are unlikely to come to a consensus on an overhaul during an election year. \u201cThroughout President Biden\u2019s first year in office, his administration has taken some critical actions to fix our broken immigration system,\u201d Menendez said in a statement, adding that more needs to be done to reverse Trump policies on the border. \u201cIn 2022, when immigration policy and border management will be focal points of national debate, the Biden-Harris administration cannot run away from immigration policy,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "Living with the virus, as the world is finding out, is easier said than done. From the US Supreme Court to Australian Open tennis courts, and from a French President vowing to \u201cpiss off\u201d the unvaccinated to China\u2019s iron fist pre-Olympic lockdowns, Covid-19\u2019s political fallout is ever more contagious. Far from alleviating the extreme dilemmas the pandemic presents leaders, the milder Omicron variant is making them more acute \u2013 partly because its transmissibility is still filling hospitals and gutting vital workforces. And yet, as the global crisis enters a third year, there\u2019s a palpable sense that populations, at least in democracies, are beginning to move on \u2013 through exhaustion or collective common sense \u2013 to a new accommodation with Covid-19. But China\u2019s Communist rulers are going in the opposite direction, locking down millions of their people as they try to prevent the Winter Olympics \u2013 a showcase for the country\u2019s emerging superpower might \u2013 from becoming a humiliating epicenter of infection. In the US and parts of Europe, meanwhile, this shift is also being driven by the fact many people have tested positive, or know someone who has, and experienced few symptoms, leading to questions about the logic of current public health guidance, including recommendations for people to isolate, even if they are asymptomatic and fully vaccinated. But the pandemic pattern that saw national, state and local governments struggle to keep up with the chameleon threat of an invisible enemy is being repeated in this new phase of the struggle. Many are rushing to adapt Covid isolation protocols and testing and booster shot regimes specific to Omicron, balancing a desire to alleviate often record hospitalizations with the lessened impact of the virus elsewhere. Beijing on high alert as China's first Omicron cluster edges closer weeks before the Olympics But Covid-19 has lost none of its capacity to exacerbate existing cultural and ideological political divides, especially in the United States. The explosive political brew of increased transmissibility and the cumulative social and human toll of the long fight against Covid has played out, for example, in a bitter but newly eased Chicago showdown between the city\u2019s mayor and the teachers\u2019 union over reopening schools. Elsewhere, conservative governors who long saw political advantage in downplaying the virus may now look ahead of the curve, though at the cost of many lives, while Omicron is only beginning its assault on the heartland. Early in the pandemic, then-President Donald Trump was criticized for putting political and economic considerations ahead of science. But there are growing signs that leaders like President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron or Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison are now also adopting a more politicized approach, driven by shifting public opinion, circumstance and electoral self-preservation. Leaders now insist schools must stay open, lockdowns are not an option and, in some cases, argue that the unvaccinated \u2013 who make up most of those in intensive care units \u2013 have made their choice. In Washington, the administration is on tenterhooks to see whether one of the prime weapons of Biden\u2019s armory against the virus \u2013 vaccine requirements for large companies and certain health care workers \u2013 will survive a skeptical Supreme Court. The decision is expected at any time, but a hearing last week featured a conservative majority apparently open to arguments that Biden overstepped his powers, at least with regard to big business. Betraying its anxiety, the White House on Monday circulated a opinion piece from \u201cThe Hill\u201d newspaper by a George Washington University School of Medicine expert that warned that Covid-19 was \u201ckilling the nation\u2019s workforce\u201d and urged the justices to uphold Biden\u2019s mandates. Supreme Court ruling on mandates may depend on how the justices value vaccines The case, rooted in challenges to the measures by Republican-led states, revives the long duel between individual freedom and the extraordinary measures the government uses to fight a pandemic that threatens everyone regardless of political affiliation. If the court rules against the administration, it\u2019s hard to argue that it will not be responsible for more sickness and death simply because of the realities of the virus. At a minimum, big firms will have to consider their own powers to require vaccination, a factor that could delay post-Omicron reopening or have economic impacts at a time when the virus is still killing an average of more than 1,200 Americans every day. The Supreme Court case is a test of the complicated choices being forced on Western democracies by the worst pandemic in 100 years. In some ways, as divisive as it is, this is the safety valve of democracy working as it should \u2013 allowing the airing of opposing opinions at a time of national stress. As Biden struggles to fulfill his vow to close down the virus, he has the consolation of not facing the political heat alone. The extraordinary saga in Australia of tennis star and vaccine skeptic Novak Djokovic, who was just freed from immigration detention over a dispute over his visa ahead of the Australian Open, has put Morrison\u2019s government in the eye of a political storm. The 20-time Serbian Grand Slam champion was freed by a judge who ruled he had been treated unfairly by border authorities after arriving in the country on a vaccine exemption. Claims by the multimillionaire celebrity\u2019s family that he was a political prisoner were an insult to those languishing in jail in places like China, Myanmar or North Korea. But like Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Djokovic has become a kind of sporting dissident, and their stands on vaccines have made them heroes for skeptics and headaches for their sports. Djokovic won his court case but few Australians are cheering Morrison\u2019s government has every political incentive to take a tough stand against Djokovic. Firstly, everyone traveling to Australia, even citizens, needs to show proof of vaccination with rare exceptions. The country has endured almost two years of near isolation from the rest of the world. Families were split. Now, many Australians suspect that Djokovic got special treatment because of who he is and his capacity to pay a high-powered legal team. \u201cRules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders. No one is above these rules,\u201d Morrison tweeted last week. The government in Canberra is still deliberating whether to deport Djokovic a week ahead of the championships in Melbourne. This drama could hardly have played out in a worse place; the city has endured some of the world\u2019s most punitive lockdowns. Morrison\u2019s mind, meanwhile, will be concentrated on the fact he faces reelection in May. And while his government won early plaudits for keeping Covid out of the country with restrictions far more onerous than those experienced in the US early on, there\u2019s now deep national fatigue. And although many are angry at Djokovic, his case is also raising questions about whether such strict entry rules make sense any more with Omicron spreading like wildfire. Morrison has tried to straddle the political debate by saying the country must move past the \u201cheavy hand of government\u201d by ending lockdowns, but he\u2019s getting hammered by the opposition and feuding with states like Western Australia and Queensland that adopted more cautious Covid-19 guidance. The case of Djokovic also intersects with another debate: the extent to which those who have refused to take safe, mostly free and effective vaccines are now responsible for curtailing the freedoms of the fully vaccinated and boosted. In the United States and elsewhere, limitations on daily life might be less restrictive had more people taken their shots \u2013 and been largely protected from the serious illness that is threatening to swamp hospitals. In many cases, those most reluctant to embrace vaccines often also come from conservative areas where measures like social distancing and mask-wearing are less observed. But the clashing cultural responses to the pandemic underscore America\u2019s creed of individualism and broad suspicion of European-style collective responsibility. Macron says he wants to 'piss off' the unvaccinated, as tensions rise over new French vaccine pass In France, however, President Emmanuel Macron, is putting his political credibility on the line with a tough stance against the unvaccinated. Like Morrison, Macron is within weeks of an election. The French President, who has often seemed imperious in the Elys\u00e9e Palace and has had an up-and-down relationship with the public, is pushing stiffened legislation that would require a vaccine pass to enter restaurants, bars and to travel inside the country. \u201cNow the unvaccinated, I really want to piss them off. And so, we\u2019re going to keep doing it, until the end. This is the strategy,\u201d Macron told \u201cLe Parisien\u201d newspaper last week. His plan to ostracize the unvaccinated caused a political uproar and would never fly in the US. But it may be less of a gamble than it looks. His polling before the two-round presidential election in April is robust, and he waited until more than 74% of French people were fully vaccinated \u2013 one of the highest rates in Europe \u2013 before taking his stand. If Macron wins a second term, he will be one of the few Western leaders so far who has managed to master the politics of the pandemic. Complaints, however, that Macron is betraying Napoleonic instincts pale in comparison with draconian measures adopted by China to suppress new outbreaks of the virus that first emerged in the central city of Wuhan before spreading worldwide. Authorities just imposed various levels of lockdown isolation on the city of Tianjin, and plan to test 14 million residents after the discovery of a small number of Omicron cases. The move is a nightmare scenario for the communist leadership since Tianjin is only 80 miles from Beijing, which will next month host the Winter Olympics. China\u2019s party bosses have placed extraordinary political prestige on holding the Games, and a major outbreak in the athletes village would be a public relations disaster. Tight restrictions are in place for competitors, officials and media entering China for the Olympics. But given the highly transmissible Omicron variant, it is hard to see how China\u2019s attempt to completely keep its more than 1 billion people isolated is sustainable in the long term, especially since the country has been largely cut off from the world for two years. Even in an authoritarian nation, the pressures of the pandemic create serious strains, although they may not be as openly discussed as those in a democracy, especially one as internally divided as the United States. Strongman President Xi Jinping has tried everything to ensure China lives without Covid-19. But even he may now have no choice but to live with it, as difficult as that may be.",

            "article_content": "On Monday night, former President Donald Trump endorsed Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, for reelection. Which, in and of itself, isn\u2019t all that surprising. After all, Trump was an open admirer of Orban\u2019s time in office \u2013 even going so far as to welcome the prime minister to the White House in 2019, an honor long denied Orban by past US presidents. And Orban will be up for a fourth term sometime this spring, which explains the Trump endorsement timing. But, the words that Trump used to endorse Orban are worth spending some time on because they are so revealing about what the former president values in a leader. Here\u2019s the Trump endorsement: \u201cViktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary truly loves his Country and wants safety for his people. He has done a powerful and wonderful job in protecting Hungary, stopping illegal immigration, creating jobs, trade, and should be allowed to continue to do so in the upcoming Election. He is a strong leader and respected by all. He has my Complete support and Endorsement for reelection as Prime Minister!\u201d Let me draw your attention to two adjectives in particular that Trump used in the endorsement: \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d And let me suggest that Trump is drawn to Orban not in spite of his authoritarian tendencies but because of them. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Consider what Orban has done in recent years to consolidate power and establish himself in the mold of a prototypical authoritarian: 1. Seized control of the university system in the country 2. Changed election laws 3. Altered textbooks to reflect his anti-immigration stance 4. Cracked down on independent media There\u2019s more \u2013 lots more \u2013 but you get the general gist: Orban, over the past decade, has sought to consolidate power and eliminate both his opposition and the country\u2019s free media. And Trump admires him for it. And it\u2019s not just Orban. During Trump\u2019s time as a candidate for president and then in office, he regularly praised authoritarian leaders for their strength and toughness. (Emphasis below is mine.) On Russian President Vladimir Putin: \u201cThe man has very strong control over a country. Now, it\u2019s a very different system and I don\u2019t happen to like the system, but certainly in that system, he\u2019s been a leader. Far more than our president has been a leader.\u201d On Chinese President Xi Jinping: \u201cAnd I like President Xi a lot. I consider him a friend, and \u2013 but I like him a lot. I\u2019ve gotten to know him very well. He\u2019s a strong gentleman, right? Anybody that \u2013 he\u2019s a strong guy, tough guy.\u201d On Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan: \u201cPresident Erdogan. He\u2019s tough, but I get along with him. And maybe that\u2019s a bad thing, but I think it\u2019s a really good thing.\u201d The point here is pretty simple: Trump very much believes that might makes right. He admires authoritarians like Orban (and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whom he endorsed last year) because he is attracted to their ability to do whatever they want whenever they want. He is not concerned with the impacts on a free society of having a leader of the sort Orban is. His thought process never gets that far; it\u2019s simply that these guys are tough, and Trump not only likes tough but aspires to be tough like them. There is, of course, a big difference between being strong (or tough) and being just. Strength is not wisdom \u2013 and often strength undermines wisdom. Trump seems to not grasp that difference \u2013 or just doesn\u2019t care. In his mind, leaders take as much power as they can for as long as they can. Which explains not just his support for Orban but also his continued efforts to undermine the free and fair presidential election of 2020.",

The Peabody Awards are presented every spring in recognition of achievements in broadcasting across multiple platforms including radio, television, streaming network programs and websites. June 6-9, 2022 - Winners of the 82nd annual Peabody Awards are announced during a multi-day virtual celebration. April 13, 2022 - Nominations are announced. The awards are administered by the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Georgia. The awards are named after George Foster Peabody, a major benefactor of the University of Georgia. Award submissions are designated as documentary, entertainment, news, children\u2019s, educational and public service, but there are no categories for the awards themselves.

            "article_content": "Midterm elections are almost always about incumbent presidents, especially when they are unpopular. But in a unique twist this year, two ex-presidents who lost control of the House while in office have turned into their parties\u2019 closing messengers. Barack Obama and Donald Trump personify two rival visions of the meaning of America itself and are extending their bitter years-long duel as they find themselves on opposite sides of a profound confrontation over the future of US democracy. Obama remains an avatar of progressive change and an increasingly diverse nation, who\u2019s far more popular than current Democratic President Joe Biden. He\u2019s the most sought-after political fireman for Democrats struggling to survive tight swing state races and is being used to energize young, minority and suburban middle-class voters. Trump has mobilized his Make America Great Again movement, which first emerged as a backlash to the first Black presidency and is built around the notion that the cultural values of a largely White, working-class nation is under siege from political correctness, undocumented migration, experts and the establishment.   Obama is lambasting politicians, celebrities and sports stars who peddle conspiracy theories, fear and social media \u201cgarbage\u201d of which Trump is the most prominent exponent. And he\u2019s delivering searing take-downs of the 45th president\u2019s proteges who are running for election on the platform of his 2020 election falsehoods \u2013 like Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake. \u201cWhy would you vote for somebody who you know is not telling the truth about something? I mean, on something that important, I don\u2019t care how nicely they say it. I don\u2019t care how poised they are or how well-lit they are,\u201d Obama said of the former local TV news anchor, who has emerged as a rising MAGA star, in Arizona on Wednesday. \u201cWhat happens when truth doesn\u2019t matter anymore?\u201d Obama added. \u201cIf you just repeat something over and over again, and it\u2019s a lie, and yet because your side is saying it, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Trump adopted exactly that tactic in his return to the campaign trail in Iowa on Thursday night, in what was ostensibly an appearance for veteran GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, but felt like a first-in-the-nation caucus warmup for 2024. Trump\u2019s top aides have been eyeing the third week of November for a 2024 presidential campaign announcement, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. At the Iowa rally, Trump falsely claimed that he had won in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 2020, two of the states that helped Biden win the White House. \u201cYour favorite president got screwed,\u201d Trump told his crowd on a frigid night in Sioux City, in which he repeated false conspiracies that Obama spied on his campaign in 2016. One interesting comparison of the styles of Trump and Obama on show in their rival rallies is in their use of humor. Trump has long used comedy \u2013 often dark and cruel \u2013 to bind himself to his audience, a feature that doesn\u2019t always come across on TV. Often his crowds look like they are having a whale of a time, enthralled by a rule-breaking bull in a china shop trashing decorum with every word and lacerating his opponents with outrageous accusations and belittling nicknames. On Thursday, Trump had his crowd in stitches in a digression from an otherwise dystopian speech as a stiff wind blew around the teleprompters showing his prepared remarks. \u201cI\u2019ve got these teleprompters waving like a flag,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get sea sick!\u201d Obama\u2019s humor is typically warmer, although no less cutting, but he uses it effectively to ridicule Republicans before delivering a devastating political hit. For instance, in Wisconsin last weekend, he branded Republicans as the party of the rich when he accused Sen. Ron Johnson of voting for a tax break for private plane owners. \u201cHe fought for this. And then, his adult children bought not one, not two, but three private planes because apparently, carpooling was not an option.  Now, I mean, you need three?\u201d Obama joked. People in Obama\u2019s extended circle have remarked that their former boss has been on fire this campaign season. Lacking the burdens of presidential office, unlike his former vice president, Obama has shown the kind of freedom and relish for big political rallies that rocketed him to the Democratic nomination in 2008. It\u2019s easy to tell when the 44th president doesn\u2019t have his heart in his task. In the early rallies of his 2012 election race, for instance, he was lethargic and weary, and he didn\u2019t approach top form in his events last year in an off-year election in Virginia. But his rallies this year have rocked with the pulsating energy and enthusiasm that is often lacking at appearances by the incumbent president, an older, more conventional politician. Obama has also come up with far more relatable and focused economic messages than Biden has managed \u2013 ironically performing the same role for the current president as another ex-president, Bill Clinton, performed for him in the 2012 campaign \u2013 a service that led Obama to dub the 42nd president \u201cthe explainer-in-chief.\u201d Obama\u2019s talent for oratory is undiminished and he looks like he\u2019s having great fun showing it off. He\u2019s like a basketball star who after years retired makes a comeback and suddenly starts draining three-pointers. And his popularity means he can drop into the most crucial states where candidates running away from Biden\u2019s unpopularity wouldn\u2019t welcome a visit from the president. Yet Obama\u2019s prominence is a reminder of the kind of A-list political talent that the modern Democratic Party lacks. It\u2019s an indictment that its best messenger first ran for president 14 years ago. But despite his rhetorical impact, the question is now how effective Obama will be in driving out the vote. The former president often struggled while he was in office to translate his stardust onto other Democratic candidates and lesser talents. And the question in this election is whether he\u2019s simply preaching to the converted in addressing Democrats who already planned to vote, or whether he\u2019s actually making the sale to independents and disaffected anti-Trump Republicans who Biden badly needs to show up to vote for his party. Former Obama political strategist David Axelrod, who is now a CNN commentator, said that this onetime boss is being used by his party on a specific electoral mission. \u201cIn the main, this is the time when you try and get your base out and for Democrats this is really important because the reason why incumbent parties generally lose in midterm elections is that their base is not as motivated as the out-of-office party which tends to come and vote its grievances,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cThere is an enthusiasm gap, at least in the polls, between Republicans and Democrats.\u201d While Obama is rekindling memories of a past presidency, Trump is out on the trail seeking to build the foundation for a future one. The most recent ex-president has demonstrated the extraordinary hold he still has on the Republican Party by promoting and endorsing a roster of candidates in his election-denying image. There is a question, however, whether Trump\u2019s role in orchestrating inexperienced or extreme nominees, like senatorial candidates like Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia and Blake Masters in Arizona, could cost his party the critical seats in swing states that will decide control of the Senate. Republican officials have worried all election cycle about the former president putting his own political ambitions ahead of his party. Many still blame his false claims of voter fraud for helping two Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win Senate seats in Georgia runoffs, which enabled their party to control the 50-50 chamber with the help of the tie-breaking vote cast by Vice President Kamala Harris. While he\u2019s heading out in to the country again, Trump has not been doing his normal routine of multiple rallies in the most closely contested states. The GOP has succeeded in the last few weeks in returning the focus of the election to Biden, high inflation and the economic anxieties that are spooking voters. But there are increasing signs that Trump may not wait much longer to announce a 2024 bid, not least because he has already signaled he would use a presidential campaign to brand legal investigations he faces related to his hoarding of classified documents in his home in Mar-a-Lago and his conduct leading up to the Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021, as proof of political persecution. \u201cThey are weaponizing the Justice Department,\u201d Trump said at his rally Thursday, accusing Democrats of a transgression of which he himself was guilty when he was in the White House and treated attorneys general as his personal lawyers. Former Trump White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway praised the former president for not taking the focus off the GOP\u2019s midterm message, a decision that may repay him with a radical Republican House majority that he could use to weaken Biden in the run-up to the 2024 election. \u201cHe\u2019d like to have done it already. \u2026 I think you can expect him to announce it soon,\u201d Conway said of Trump\u2019s anticipated campaign launch. \u201cHe\u2019s being urged by some people to still have a November surprise.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is just getting started. I think you should keep your cellphone on,\u201d Conway told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Thursday. The former president used his rally in Iowa to tease a new campaign. \u201cI will very, very, very probably do it again,\u201d he said, drawing cheers from the crowd. If he follows through, this midterm is unlikely to be the last election when Trump and Obama cross swords on the campaign trail. This story has been updated with additional information.",

            "article_content": "Arizona Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake showed Sunday how a new generation of Donald Trump prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are using the former President\u2019s anti-democratic playbook to taint another election. Lake appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d days after the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection aired fresh evidence that Trump knew he lost in 2020 but was determined to declare victory anyway. Her responses made clear that Trump\u2019s strategy of casting doubt on the result even before ballots are cast is a legitimate tactic in the eyes of some GOP office seekers two years later. Pressed by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Lake repeatedly refused to say that she would accept the result of her election if she lost, implied that vote counting that happens after election night is illegitimate and insisted that the 2020 presidential election was corrupt despite high-ranking officials in Trump\u2019s administration and multiple courts denying this was the case. Kari Lake doesn't commit to accepting Arizona election result if she loses \u201cI\u2019m going to win the election, and I will accept that result,\u201d Lake said. Her response underscored the potential for a crisis around November\u2019s midterm elections if GOP candidates who lose decide they will not accept the result. And it recalled a similar statement by then-Republican presidential nominee Trump in Ohio in October 2016 when he said: \u201cI would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, if I win.\u201d Many GOP candidates who have been endorsed by Trump or who support him repeat his false claims that the 2020 election was illegitimate. The possibility that some of them could win key statewide offices that end up controlling elections alarms advocates of free elections \u2013 a particularly dangerous scenario without the courage of certain Republican officials who thwarted Trump\u2019s election-stealing bid in 2020. Lake\u2019s appearance also highlighted how the most significant political dividing line in the country is not between the left and the right but between candidates who will play by the rules of democracy and those willing to further undermine it. Trump, who remains the most dominant Republican electoral force in the country, has exacerbated this situation by making acceptance of his voter fraud lies the price of admission in many GOP primaries and an effective condition for his endorsement. His claims that he won key 2020 swing states, including Arizona, despite failing to prove any irregularities, have helped to convince millions of Republican voters that he was unfairly ejected from office \u2013 and have hurt the legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency among many conservatives. Arizona Attorney General's office asks for federal investigation of conservative nonprofit True the Vote For all of her evasions and willingness to embrace Trump\u2019s debunked accusations of election fraud in 2020, Lake also showed on Sunday why she may be one potential future voice of Trumpism when its author eventually leaves the stage. As a former veteran television news journalist in Phoenix, Lake is a skillful television performer. Her answers sound persuasive, even when she\u2019s putting across information that is false or questionable, and she\u2019s adept at flipping an answer away from an issue where she could be exposed to one that will please her voters. But her political nimbleness will not be tested on a debate stage, however, since Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs has refused to debate her. Lake also showed a facility to demagogue undocumented migrants and asylum seekers at the southern border. Trump won the presidency after making that the centerpiece of his 2016 election campaign. Lake\u2019s evasion mirrors Trump\u2019s position ahead of the 2020 election. And it is one that is deeply damaging to democracy since it implies that any time a Democrat wins, it must mean fraud took place. If GOP candidates imply to their supporters the system is corrupt, many will believe it. Any candidate has the right to challenge the result of an election if they think it was unfair. But increasingly, those who just deny the facts established by officials and courts are using the specter of fraud as a political tool. This is a deeply corrosive tactic since free and fair elections rely on a defeated candidate accepting their loss. Once that is gone, democracy is in deep peril. Trump campaigns for Arizona election deniers in a state that will test his power in 2022 and beyond Trump repeatedly raised questions about the fairness of the 2020 election well before voters went to the polls and suggested that he could only be defeated by illicit means. While Lake does not go quite as fair as the ex-President, her refusal to unequivocally say she will accept the result, whatever it is, in a currently tight race does not bode well. A recent CNN poll showed no clear leader in the race between Lake and Hobbs among likely voters. Trump is still pushing falsehoods of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, repeating many of his unfounded accusations in a screed that he issued after the House select committee voted to subpoena him for testimony and documents on Thursday. Even though his claims are spurious \u2013 for example, that he must have won in 2020 because he won more votes than in 2016 \u2013 they have contributed to widespread mistrust of the electoral system among his supporters. Trump did get more popular votes in 2020 than he did in 2016. But Biden got roughly 7 million more votes than Trump and won a comfortable Electoral College majority. Skepticism about the election that was fueled by Trump persisted after he left office, however. In a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in April 2021, for instance, 70% of Republicans didn\u2019t think Biden won sufficient votes to be elected. Lake deflected a question about why she was using debunked information about 2020 fraud as a platform in her 2022 gubernatorial bid. \u201cThe real issue, Dana, is that the people don\u2019t trust our elections,\u201d she said. When asked why multiple courts and senior Trump appointees in 2020, including then Attorney General William Barr, said there was little or no voter fraud, she insisted there was plentiful evidence, but did not produce any. \u201cThe problem is, the media won\u2019t cover it,\u201d Lake insisted. Election denier Kari Lake has a real shot of winning a swing state governorship CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale has chronicled just how many GOP nominees for federal and state office in November have questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election \u2013 including at least 11 secretary of state nominees and more than half of gubernatorial nominees. That\u2019s a scary proposition in states where those elected officials have a great say over how elections are conducted and how votes are counted in 2024, when Trump is expected to be a candidate again. Lake\u2019s answers to Bash gave an opening to Hobbs, the current Arizona secretary of state, who said her rival had a responsibility to bring forward any evidence of voter fraud. \u201cThis is absolutely disqualifying. This is somebody who will have a level of authority over our state\u2019s elections, the ability to sign new legislation into law, the responsibility of certifying future elections.\u201d \u201cAnd she has not only, as you heard, refused to say if she will accept the results of this election, but also whether or not she would certify the 2024 presidential election if she\u2019s governor.\u201d Hobbs, however, has declined to directly debate Lake, warning that she could use any debate to create a \u201cspectacle.\u201d But her position also makes it impossible for Arizona voters to compare each candidate side by side. Hobbs explains why she won't debate Kari Lake As Bash put it: \u201cIf you think she\u2019s as dangerous as you\u2019re saying to democracy, is it your responsibility as a candidate who wants to run Arizona to show and explain who their alternative is?\u201d Hobbs insisted that the kind of conversation she was having on CNN would have been impossible with Lake on stage. \u201cI guarantee you, people that are struggling in Arizona right now are not making their decisions about whether or not there was a debate between myself and Kari Lake. They\u2019re going to make their decision based on the person who understands their struggle and has real solutions to try to fix that struggle.\u201d One of the key questions in the coming election is the extent to which Democratic warnings about the fate of the system of free and fair elections influences voting. With annualized inflation at near 40-year highs and gasoline prices rising again, it is likely that voters are considering less lofty concerns than the fate of democracy as they decide the destiny of the House of Representatives, the Senate and key state races. So even though democracy itself is on the ballot next month, it could well emerge from the election even more tarnished.",

            "article_content": "The debate between Democrat Tim Ryan and Republican J.D. Vance in Ohio\u2019s closer-than-expected Senate contest began with a testy exchange on the economy and quickly devolved from there into a contentious \u2013 and at times personal \u2013 clash. This race was not a contest Republicans believed would require as much money and attention as it has, given the Republican tilt of the state, which former President Donald Trump comfortably carried twice. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the seat \u201cLean Republican,\u201d while top-tier Senate campaigns in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Nevada are all still seen as more competitive. Still, Ryan\u2019s bid to replace retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman has proven a strong match for an underfunded GOP nominee that Trump pulled through the primary. Monday night\u2019s acrimony highlighted the urgency of the moment for both candidates. Analysis: Senate control is the biggest unknown with four weeks until the midterms For Ryan, millions in ads will be spent against the congressman in the coming weeks, testing the so far relatively resilient Democratic campaign in a state that\u2019s trending red. For Vance, the Republican has found his footing after a tough summer, leaning on the natural political lean of the state by accusing his Democratic opponent of faking his moderate bona fides. In a debate where neither candidate was afraid to directly go after his opponent \u2013 Ryan called Vance an \u201cass kisser,\u201d while Vance compared Ryan to a toddler \u2013 it was clear both candidates felt they had ground to make up in the race with less than four weeks to go until Election Day. Here are five takeaways from Ohio\u2019s first Senate debate: Abortion has come to shape political campaigns across the country in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning national abortion protections, and the Ohio Senate contest has been no different. Ryan sought to cast himself as the moderate on the issue in Monday\u2019s debate, saying he backed \u201cgoing back to Roe v. Wade\u201d and arguing for \u201csome moderation on this issue.\u201d He then turned the issue on Republicans, calling efforts to pass stricter abortion laws \u201cthe largest government overreach in the history of our lifetime.\u201d The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Vance, who said he was \u201cpro-life\u201d but \u201calways believed in reasonable exceptions,\u201d responded by delivering one of his most scathing lines of the night, seemingly blaming Ryan for the rape of the 10-year-old Ohio girl who sought an abortion in neighboring Indiana by noting she was allegedly raped by an undocumented immigrant and that Ryan had voted against border wall funding. \u201cIf you had done your job, she would have never been raped in the first place,\u201d Vance said, turning to Ryan. \u201cDo your job on border security, don\u2019t lecture me about opinions I don\u2019t actually have.\u201d Later in the debate, Ryan said he supported walls along the US-Mexico border where it made sense but not one wall from \u201csea to shining sea.\u201d As he has done on the campaign trail and in paid ads, Ryan sought throughout the debate to tout his independent bona fides, noting how he broke from his own party and at times backed Trump on trade. \u201cI think everybody is to blame,\u201d Ryan said when asked if President Joe Biden is to blame for rising inflation. \u201cKamala Harris is absolutely wrong on that,\u201d he added when asked if the vice president was correct when she said the border was secure.   Ryan then used this argument to hammer his opponent, arguing that he \u201ccan\u2019t stand up to anyone\u201d because even after Trump said at a recent campaign rally that Vance was \u201ckissing my ass\u201d to get him to campaign for him, the Republican nominee didn\u2019t stand up to the former President after he took his \u201cdignity from him.\u201d \u201cHe was called an ass kisser by the former President,\u201d Ryan said, adding later, \u201cOhio needs an ass kicker, not an ass kisser.\u201d Vance went with a timely response. After noting Halloween is close, he added, \u201cTim Ryan has put on a costume where he pretends to be reasonable moderate.\u201d And the Republican did little to distance himself from Trump, his party\u2019s standard bearer. When asked if Trump had done anything that concerns him, Vance urged letting \u201cthe criminal investigation play out\u201d on the mishandling of classified documents stored at Mar-a-Lago and criticized the focus on past scandals around the former President. Vance closed the debate by contrasting his personal choice two decades ago \u2013 to enlist in the Marines \u2013 with Ryan\u2019s decision to successfully run for Congress. To Vance, the race between him and Ryan is a referendum on \u201cfailed leadership\u201d in Washington, positioning that allows the Republican to carry himself as the political outsider and Ryan as the career politician. \u201cHe has been failing at his basic job for 20 years,\u201d Vance said of Ryan, who was first elected to Congress in 2002. \u201cTalks a big game but the record of accomplishment just isn\u2019t there.\u201d Although Ryan pushed back against this narrative \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not going to apologize for spending 20 years slogging away to try to help one of the hardest economically hit regions of Ohio,\u201d the Democrat said \u2013 Vance\u2019s strategy was clear. \u201cOhioans deserve certain things from their federal leadership,\u201d Vance said, capturing his entire electoral argument. \u201cThey deserve to go to the grocery store and be able to afford food without it breaking the bank. They deserve streets you can walk down safely. They deserve a country that has a border.\u201d Some of the biggest differences of the night came on foreign policy. When asked how the United States should respond to the potential Russian use of nuclear weapons, Ryan said it would call for an \u201caggressive response\u201d but added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we are at that point where (Russian President) Vladimir Putin will.\u201d Ryan than tried to turn the issue on Vance, noting that the Republican once said he doesn\u2019t \u201creally care what happens to Ukraine.\u201d \u201cJ.D. Vance would let Putin roll right through Ukraine,\u201d Ryan said, noting the large Ukrainian population in Ohio. \u201cJ.D. Vance is weak on this.\u201d Vance, however, did not shy away from those comments, saying, \u201cThe answer is that no one knows how we would respond,\u201d and mocking Ryan for saying the use of nuclear weapons would call for an \u201caggressive response.\u201d \u201cWhat exactly does that mean? Does that mean we should be in a nuclear shooting war?\u201d Vance said, accusing Ryan of being part of the \u201cbipartisan foreign policy establishment.\u201d Vance hit Ryan repeatedly on crime and fentanyl coming into the country. When the Democrat was pressed on crime by the moderators, he said, \u201cWe need more cops. We need better paid cops. And, yeah, we have to get rid of bad cops.\u201d Still, it was clear the Republican\u2019s attacks got to Ryan, who responded by saying he would not be lectured to on crime by someone who raised money for the legal defense fund of the January 6, 2021, rioters. \u201cI am not going to take a back seat to JD Vance on law enforcement,\u201d Ryan said, urging Vance not to \u201ceven try to deny it\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019ve got your Twitter posts and everything else.\u201d Ryan used the moment to cast Vance as fake: \u201cCan you imagine one guy saying out of one side of his mouth he is pro-cop and out of the other side of his mouth he is raising money for the insurrectionists who were beating up the Capitol Police?\u201d Vance responded by comparing Ryan to a toddler and said Ryan \u201cthrew the police under the bus\u201d at the height of the summer of protests over police brutality. \u201cHe attacked them as the new Jim Crow, as systemically racist, and he voted for legislation that would have stripped funding from them and redirected it toward litigation defense,\u201d Vance said. Vance also tried to make a broader point about Ryan in his attack: \u201cTim, you don\u2019t sound too bad. If you actually tried to do the things you talk about wanting to do, you wouldn\u2019t be half bad. The problem if you got 20 years and you failed to do any of it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The race for North Carolina\u2019s open Senate seat features two leading candidates who have taken opposing paths in their bids for higher office. Democrat Cheri Beasley, the first Black woman to be a major-party Senate nominee in North Carolina, has served for two decades as a judge and state Supreme Court justice, positions she has used to distance herself from politics-as-usual. Her candidacy has given Democrats hope in a state that former President Donald Trump carried twice, though even the most upbeat members of her party acknowledge she faces long odds. Republican Ted Budd, by comparison, has a familiar political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2013 going from owning a small business to winning a seat in the US House of Representatives to seeking statewide office. Aided by a Trump endorsement in the primary, Budd is now running what Republicans believe is a cautious campaign, largely relying on the state\u2019s red tilt and a favorable national environment for his party.   With control of the evenly divided Senate on the line, the differences between the candidates reflect the parties\u2019 divergent theories on how to win in North Carolina. Like many recent statewide contests, the race is expected to be tight, operatives from both sides acknowledge, with both Beasley and Budd trying to appeal to the minute, but crucial, sliver of persuadable voters while also mobilizing the party bases. \u201cThe number of independents is ever-shrinking,\u201d said Doug Heye, a Washington-based Republican operative originally from North Carolina. \u201cThose folks are not going to decide until the last four weeks or so. So every poll is going to have it within the margin of error or close enough.\u201d Beasley, whose nomination follows decades of North Carolina Democrats picking White nominees for Senate, is counting on her non-politician profile and the potency of the abortion issue to attract more minority voters and suburban women. Budd, on the other hand, has tried to run as a no-drama, generic Republican, seeking to ride the current of dissatisfaction with President Joe Biden\u2019s stewardship of the economy while avoiding unforced errors that have plagued GOP Senate candidates in other states. Budd received a boost Friday, when Trump traveled to Wilmington for a rally with the Senate hopeful and other North Carolina Republicans. Speaking for more than an hour, the former President praised Budd\u2019s introduction of a 2019 bill to enable victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants to sue sanctuary cities if the crime occurred in their jurisdiction, describing \u201cGreat Ted\u201d as a reliable \u201cAmerica First\u201d Republican. \u201cTed, you\u2019re not losing, I can tell you that. You\u2019re not going to be losing,\u201d Trump said. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 His appearance came hours after Trump allies confirmed to CNN that the former President has launched a new super PAC aimed at boosting candidates like Budd, who received endorsements in the primary and are now facing tight general election contests, ahead of the November midterm election. The new group, MAGA Inc., is expected to start spending on ads and get-out-the-vote efforts as early as next week. Democrats are worried Budd is largely getting a pass, despite voting against certifying Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral victory and his campaign declining to say whether he would accept the results of the 2022 midterms. And by avoiding issues that have hampered Republican Senate nominees in states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, he has so far escaped the national glare or any elevation of his more conservative positions. Michael Bitzer, a politics professor at Catawba College, said Budd has been \u201cleaning on the fundamentals.\u201d \u201cRegistered Republicans will have a higher turnout rate than Democrats, the midterm environment is generally against the President\u2019s party,\u201d Bitzer told CNN. \u201cAnd I think he is counting on those fundamentals to stay at work until November 8.\u201d Central to Beasley\u2019s campaign is her title: Judge. Her events and press releases are littered with references to her judicial background. When she attacked Budd for voting against legislation that would make it harder to overturn a presidential election, she said, \u201cAs a judge who upheld the Constitution for over two decades, I will stand up against attacks on our democracy.\u201d When South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham proposed a federal abortion ban earlier this month, Beasley slammed it, noting that \u201cas a judge for over two decades I protected these constitutional rights, and I will not hesitate to vote to protect these freedoms in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Graham's 15-week abortion bill further complicates Republican midterm messaging And her campaign rolled out an ad earlier this month that highlighted a slew of Republican, independent, and Democratic judges backing Beasley\u2019s candidacy. \u201cAs judges, our job is not about politics. It\u2019s about standing up for what\u2019s right,\u201d the judges say in the spot. \u201cVoters don\u2019t think judges are politicians,\u201d said Morgan Jackson, a longtime Democratic strategist in North Carolina. \u201cAnd what Beasley has been able to do on her campaign and her paid ads is say, \u2018I have spent my career looking unbiased at an issue and making a decision based on law.\u2019 That is something voters are craving in this environment of polarization.\u201d But Trump sought to wield Beasley\u2019s background against her in his appearance Friday, accusing her of letting violent criminals off the hook with lenient sentences and supporting court-packing at the Supreme Court level by calling for the Senate filibuster to be abolished. \u201cShe was a Marxist radical,\u201d Trump said Friday, claiming that Beasley \u201chas vowed to be the 50th vote to abolish the Senate filibuster.\u201d After graduating from the University of Tennessee College of Law in 1991, Beasley spent a few years as a public defender in Cumberland County, North Carolina, before working her way up the judicial ladder as a district court judge in the county. Beasley\u2019s first run for a statewide judicial position came in 2008 when she successfully ran for the North Carolina Court of Appeals. Four years later, Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue appointed her to the North Carolina Supreme Court and Beasley successfully won a full term on the bench in 2014. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper named her chief justice of the high court in 2019, making her the first Black woman to serve in the position. And Beasley\u2019s first run as a Democrat came in 2020, when she unsuccessfully sought a full term as chief justice, losing by just 401 votes. Jackson said this background, coupled with a focus on an issue like abortion that is motivating Democrats across the country after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, \u201copens up an avenue for Beasley to swing voters and even some more moderate Republicans that Democrats have not had a chance to reach.\u201d Budd\u2019s allies, in a sign that they recognize her appeal, have responded by tying Beasley to special interests and using her judicial decisions to allege that she is soft on crime. Republicans are hopeful that this strategy \u2013 coupled with concerns about all-Democratic control of Washington \u2013 could sink Beasley, even if she is running a strong campaign. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem for her, and this is the problem for Democrats across the board: Suburban-based unaffiliated voters are split between the economy and between the social issues around abortion,\u201d said Paul Shumaker, a veteran Republican strategist in North Carolina. \u201cThe voters Democrats have a turnout problem with are minorities and young people, who are most affected by inflation.\u201d Beasley\u2019s campaign has argued that, as a history-making candidate, she is uniquely positioned to turn out Black voters across the state. A key aspect to this operation has been Beasley\u2019s focus on turning out rural Black voters, many of whom are more likely to vote in presidential cycles. In a statement to CNN, Beasley\u2019s campaign said she was focused on protecting the rights of \u201call North Carolinians, in every part of the state, of every political party.\u201d The campaign, along with the Democratic coordinated campaign in the state, has prioritized Black outreach through churches, historically Black colleges and universities, and the \u201cDivine Nine\u201d historically Black sororities and fraternities. But Democrats have been here before in North Carolina \u2013 buoyant about a statewide candidate appearing well positioned to win, only for that candidate to narrowly lose on Election Day. That includes 2020, when Democratic Senate nominee Cal Cunningham was sunk by a sexting scandal. Democrats haven\u2019t won a US Senate election in the state since 2008. Herschel Walker's bizarre move to lower expectations So far, the race has flown under the national radar, something that concerns Democrats. \u201cWhat worries me is the fact that Budd right now, because he is not Herschel Walker, because he is not Blake Masters, because he is not (Mehmet) Oz, and because he is so quiet and has been in hiding, he is just not getting that attention and that negative notoriety,\u201d a North Carolina Democratic operative close to the Beasley campaign said, comparing Budd to the GOP Senate nominees in Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania. The operative added: \u201cBudd\u2019s calculation is I can ride this out and stay quiet.\u201d In Budd, North Carolina may have the closest candidate to a generic Republican. The 50-year-old former gun range owner, who was first elected to the House in 2016, represents a district that stretches up and down Interstate 85 and encompasses suburbs of both the Charlotte and the Piedmont Triad regions. In Congress, he has aligned himself with Trump and the pro-Trump Freedom Caucus, acquiring a conservative voting record but not one distinguishable from other members of the Republican Conference. Budd\u2019s low-key approach to his Senate bid is seen as an asset in a large and politically split state like North Carolina. \u201cSometimes boring and reliable is the way to win,\u201d said a person close to the campaign. It\u2019s also something of a necessity for Budd, who has raised far less money than Beasley \u2013 the Democrat had raised about $16 million through June 30, compared with around $6.3 million for Budd. That limited his campaign\u2019s presence on the TV airwaves, a space Beasley dominated through much of the summer. Budd has since received help from outside groups, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, reserved $27.6 million in TV ads between Labor Day and Election Day. Budd\u2019s first general-election ad for TV \u2013 which was paid for by the NRSC \u2013 features the congressman in a grocery store, blaming \u201cBiden\u2019s reckless spending\u201d for \u201crecord inflation that\u2019s crushing working families in North Carolina.\u201d In addition to these well-funded pitches to undecided voters, Budd will need to run up the numbers with the Republican base, something Trump aimed to help with during Friday\u2019s rally. Trump is back in the headlines, and it may cost Republicans in November But Trump\u2019s visit is hardly without risk for Budd. Democrats hope that the former President injecting himself further into the race will remind swing voters of the 2020 election and anger over the political climate that followed. And Trump\u2019s return to North Carolina will help Democrats highlight Budd\u2019s votes against certifying certain 2020 presidential election results. Budd has also attempted to moderate his tone and stances on other issues that put him at odds with voters in the middle, particularly abortion. Earlier this year, Budd told TV station WRAL that he opposes abortion and suggested that he could oppose exceptions even if the life of the mother is in danger. That has made it into attack ads from Democratic groups, including one from Senate Majority PAC that accuses Budd of backing legislation \u201cthat could criminalize abortion for women and put North Carolina doctors in jail.\u201d Republicans watching the race told CNN that Budd\u2019s recent co-sponsorship of a 15-week abortion ban, which is less unpopular than a total ban, can help him appear less extreme on abortion \u2013 or, at the very least, nullify the Democratic attacks. But it\u2019s a delicate act, they admit. \u201cHow Republicans manage that one issue alone determines whether they have a good year,\u201d said Shumaker. CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The last time Donald Trump delivered a major speech in Washington, DC, from outside the White House it unleashed a vicious mob attack. There was no violence this time, but his searing bombast may have heralded the dawn of a new era of American extremism. Trump returned Tuesday for the first time since leaving the capital in disgrace in January 2021 and made clear he plans to take the country down a dark, demagogic, dystopian road in the coming months. His assurance that it is when and not if he launches a 2024 White House campaign never looked more locked in. Trump vowed at the America First Policy Institute summit to \u201csave our country,\u201d chillingly employing many of the rhetorical devices of authoritarian leaders as he brimmed with bitterness, a persecution complex and stoked resentment against vulnerable members of society like the homeless and transgender athletes. The ex-President conjured an updated and intensified picture of the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d that he first laid out in his 2017 inaugural address. He bemoaned a \u201cfailing nation\u201d swamped by historic inflation, begging the Saudis for oil, a media that sees itself as \u201cthe police of honesty,\u201d deep state bureaucrats, \u201chacks and thugs\u201d in Congress and cities overrun by undocumented migrants preying on innocent citizens that exemplify contempt for the law and the police. Latest moves suggest DOJ investigation of 2020 election is looking at conduct directly related to Trump and his closest allies Amid new signs of an expansive Justice Department probe into the election-stealing scheme launched by his cronies and shocking evidence about his 2020 coup attempt from the House select committee, Trump complained Democrats had \u201cweaponized law enforcement \u2026 against the opposition party.\u201d His railing against the investigations that could hold him to account for his dereliction of duty while in office highlighted the absurdity of the only president ever to launch an insurrection lecturing on law and order. That was a point picked up by President Joe Biden, who tweeted: \u201cCall me old fashioned, but I don\u2019t think inciting a mob that attacks a police officer is \u2018respect for the law.\u2019 You can\u2019t be pro-insurrection and pro-cop \u2013 or pro-democracy, or pro-American.\u201d As so often, Trump\u2019s complaints about the supposed actions of others mirrored his own transgressions. It was he who tried to weaponize the Justice Department, to pursue political enemies, offer pardons to allies and to seek to overturn the 2020 election. And when Trump complained that his Democratic foes were guilty of misinformation against him \u2013 \u201cThey say stuff and they think you are going to believe it\u201d \u2013 he could have been describing his own lies and alternative realities that are amplified by the conservative media machine that convinced millions of Americans that the election was stolen. Merrick Garland does not rule out charging Trump and others in January 6 probe Trump\u2019s comments also seemed a hedge against any attempt by the Justice Department to hold him criminally liable for his conduct after the 2020 election. Still, Attorney General Merrick Garland vowed that outside political forces would not deter the department if charges were merited. \u201cWe pursue justice without fear or favor. We intend to hold everyone \u2013 anyone \u2013 who is criminally responsible for the events surrounding January 6 or any attempt to interfere with the lawful transfer of power from one administration to another accountable,\u201d Garland told NBC News\u2019 Lester Holt in a taped interview that ran in part Tuesday on MSNBC. \u201cThat is what we do. We don\u2019t pay any attention to other issues with respect to that.\u201d In many ways, Trump\u2019s pitch was a supercharged version of when he first launched his 2016 presidential campaign. He again railed against undocumented migrants and crime, and promised to build his border wall. He seized on the Biden administration\u2019s economic struggles and portrayed his own tenure as a golden age by comparison when Americans were safe, prosperous and respected. Democrats may not like to hear it, but Trump\u2019s message remains a seductive one to many Americans who believe the country is beset by open borders, political correctness, weak policing and mistreated by leeching foreign allies. A democratic system channels the frustrations and beliefs of large sectors of society into political campaigns and administrations. (Not that Trump has shown he has much respect for the will of the voters.) So while Trump\u2019s methods are often authoritarian and outrageous, he is not operating in a political vacuum. His strength as a candidate is that he sensed deep disillusionment with the political system in 2016 and rode it to power. He\u2019s trying a similar formula now. Trump pushes harsh criminal justice agenda in first DC speech since leaving office Some liberal critics of the media still complain that an ex-President gets so much coverage \u2013 years before the 2024 election \u2013 and that the attention only boosts Trump. But while he is banned from Twitter and has been mostly confined to conservative media for the last 18 months, the pulse of Trumpism beats strongly in the heartland. Forests of Trump 2020 and Trump 2024 banners outside major cities may be an anecdotal sign of strength, but they are ubiquitous and a sign that he touches some voters like no other politician. And before much longer, Democrats, and the small but courageous band of anti-Trump Republicans, will have to confront the former President directly. Biden appears to have recognized this already given his own strident attacks on Trump over the last two days. Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday was an unmistakable sign he is on the comeback trail, is deadly serious about trying to regain power and would use any means at his disposal to make it reality. This time around, Trump\u2019s campaign would take place in the full knowledge of his authoritarian impulses and his willingness to use violence \u2013 on January 6, 2021. A second Trump presidency would make the first one look conventional and calm. The ex-President, for example, called on Tuesday for homeless Americans to be loaded up from city centers and taken to tented camps. He mocked trans athletes and said presidents should be able to send National Guard troops into Democratic states where governors didn\u2019t fight violent crime. He called for quick trials for drug dealers to speed swift executions and demanded the return of \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policies in cities that critics decried as institutionalized racism. \u201cOur country is now a cesspool of crime,\u201d the former President said, painting of a vision of country hostage to \u201cdrugged out lunatics\u201d and \u201csadists.\u201d He promised to purge the education system and to sack \u201crogue\u201d bureaucrats who constrained his wildest impulses the first time around. In short, Trump was advocating an all-powerful presidency that would trample over the guardrails of the law and the Constitution and the elected power of governors. In other words, an administration that would be even more aberrant and authoritarian than his first. Trump's revenge tour over Michigan Republican's impeachment vote endangers a GOP House seat Unlike many of his campaign speeches, Trump did not dedicate his entire appearance to fomenting lies about his 2020 election loss. But he did fire up the crowd with claims that he won two elections, not one. This argument appears to be effective with his most fervent voters, according to a new CNN/SSRS poll released on Tuesday. Sixty-six percent of Republicans said Biden\u2019s 2020 election win was not legitimate. Still, Trump\u2019s continual harping on 2020 may not be a winning argument with a broader electorate. Some 69%, of those asked, a new high in CNN polling, reject the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen. Trump\u2019s delivery on Tuesday was not the exuberant tour de force of his rallies. It also lacked the outrageous comedy of his events in his first campaign that did not always come across on television, but was vital in convincing supporters they were at the best party of their lives with a host who dared to say everything polite society disdained. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s monotone dirge summed up his own bitterness and his sinister arguments. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Trump\u2019s appearance \u2013 given what we know about the steps he took to cling onto power in 2020 \u2013 was his use of authoritarian tropes. For instance, he portrayed himself as persecuted by the forces of the law \u2013 but insisted he endured the suffering to save the country. \u201cWho has been through anything like this?\u201d Trump said, slamming the Russia probe, his two impeachments and the January 6 committee. \u201cI\u2019m doing it for America. And it\u2019s my honor to do it. It\u2019s my great, great honor to do it. Because if I don\u2019t do our nation is doomed to become another Venezuela or become another Soviet Union,\u201d Trump said, tapping into a classic demagogue\u2019s toolbox to pose as a Superman leader shouldering the peoples\u2019 burden. Tuesday\u2019s speech by Trump may come to be seen as the unofficial launch of his presidential campaign. He told Republicans convinced they will win the midterm elections in November they need help in the White House, and it will be coming soon. But his march to the Republican nomination is far from assured. In the CNN poll, 55% of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters said they did not want Trump as their party\u2019s nominee in 2024. The GOP nominating system, however, means that Trump does not need majority support to secure a place atop the GOP ticket in 2024. A huge field like in 2016 could balkanize opposition to him within his party. A consensus anti-Trump candidate whom his opponents unite behind could doom a campaign by the former President. But that would require a major contender to show the kind of courage in standing up to Trump that has been at a premium since the former business tycoon\u2019s hostile takeover of the GOP in 2015. Trump\u2019s speech on Tuesday at times came across as an attempt to strangle any such attempts before they really get started. And it also underscored that not only has the ex-President not changed, but that the next stage of his political evolution will be darker and potentially more dangerous than what came before.",

            "article_content": "Georgia has become the center of the political landscape \u2013 and it\u2019s likely to stay there for the remainder of 2022. President Joe Biden traveled there Tuesday to kick off a push for voting rights legislation. With Republican primary wars brewing, Democratic discontent over Congress failing to stymie the state\u2019s restrictive new voting law growing and two of the nation\u2019s marquee gubernatorial and Senate races set for this fall, Biden used his visit to Georgia on Tuesday as a springboard for a push for national legislation to protect voting rights. \u201cThe question is, where will the institution of the United States Senate stand? Every senator, Democrat, Republican and independent, will have to declare where they stand not just for the moment, but for the ages,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWill you stand against voter suppression? Yes or no? That\u2019s the question you\u2019ll answer. Will you stand to against election subversion? Yes or no? We stand for democracy? Yes or no,\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing every senator, every American, should remember: History has never been kind to those who have sided with voter suppression over voters rights. And it\u2019ll be even less kind for those who side with elections subversion,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSo I asked every elected official in America: How do you want to be remembered?\u201d It\u2019s an effort to counter Republicans in statehouses across the country who have enacted restrictive new laws in response to former President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. However, there is reason for skepticism that Biden\u2019s public push will have much impact. Georgia\u2019s move into the center of the political universe is certain to be overshadowed by much bigger news in the football-obsessed region. The University of Georgia\u2019s win over the University of Alabama in Monday night\u2019s national championship game \u2013 the biggest win for Georgia in more than 40 years \u2013 will continue to dominate headlines in the state. Meanwhile, where Biden\u2019s administration hoped to find unity for a speech being attended by family members of Martin Luther King Jr., Georgia\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation and the heads of a host of civil rights and voting rights leaders, the President was instead met by skepticism within his own party. The state\u2019s most prominent voting rights activist, Democratic candidate for governor Stacey Abrams, skipped Biden\u2019s event due to a scheduling conflict. And voting rights groups that have long criticized Biden\u2019s White House for failing to take a more aggressive approach to legislation that has stalled in the Senate, where Democrats don\u2019t have enough votes to overcome a Republican filibuster or to change the filibuster rules to work around it, are increasingly vocal about their frustration. Democrats are set to force votes this week on bills that have no way forward unless filibuster rules are changed. A coalition of voting rights groups boycotted Biden\u2019s event in Atlanta on Tuesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another speech from the President,\u201d Cliff Albright, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a group boycotting the event, said on CNN Tuesday morning. \u201cWe don\u2019t need them to come to Georgia and use us as a prop. What we need is work.\u201d Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the Atlanta University Center Consortium on the grounds of Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University. The site, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, \u201cis a crossroads for students and for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Many of their students participated in the civil rights movement through sit-ins and protests.\u201d Biden is expected to use his speech to argue for a carveout to the Senate\u2019s filibuster \u2013 which requires at least 60 votes to advance legislation \u2013 for voting rights bills. The two measures he is pushing \u2013 the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act \u2013 would jointly bolster voting protections by, among other things, creating national standards for mail-in voting and restoring some stripped-out elements of the Voting Rights Act. However, even as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, vows to bring those bills for votes as soon as Wednesday, some Democrats remain unwilling to change the filibuster rules. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia reiterated his belief Tuesday morning that \u201cgetting rid of the filibuster doesn\u2019t make\u201d the Senate \u201cwork better.\u201d Democratic officials and strategists and voting rights groups have long seen Georgia as the forefront of the nation\u2019s voting rights battle. Prior to Trump\u2019s election, Republicans in the state had already enacted strict laws that experts said disproportionately disenfranchised people of color. None of that has stopped Trump from sniping at the state\u2019s top Republican officials from the right, though. He has blamed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger for his loss to Biden by nearly 12,000 votes in the state in 2020. Kemp now faces a primary challenge from former Sen. David Perdue, a Republican who lost his seat in a 2020 runoff. Perdue has Trump\u2019s support and has echoed his lies about fraud in the 2020 election. US Rep. Jody Hice, meanwhile, is running against Raffensperger in the GOP primary for secretary of state. Still, the Republican officials that Trump has targeted were using Biden\u2019s trip to try to shore up support with their own base. Raffensperger held a news conference Tuesday in which he characterized Biden as seeking a \u201cfederal elections takeover\u201d and misrepresenting the state\u2019s restrictive new voting law. He said he wants an amendment to the US Constitution that would ban undocumented people from voting and establish a national voter ID requirement. \u201cPresident Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are coming here later today to push for policies that will undermine the integrity of our elections,\u201d Raffensperger said. \u201cMake no mistake. This is as an attempt to weaken election security under the guise of voting rights.\u201d CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein, Manu Raju, Ali Zaslav and Jason Morris contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a progressive Democrat who campaigned on sending Americans a monthly $1,000 check, will win a special election on Tuesday to replace the late US Rep. Alcee Hastings in his South Florida district, CNN projects. Cherfilus-McCormick defeated Republican Jason Mariner for the heavily Democratic seat, leading with more than 78% of the vote as of 8 p.m. ET. She now heads to Washington, where she will be the first Democrat of Haitian descent to serve in Congress, according to the National Haitian American Elected Officials Network. The Democratic majority in the House now grows to 10 lawmakers ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, when President Joe Biden\u2019s party will attempt to hold on to its legislative power. Cherfilus-McCormick, a businesswoman who had twice unsuccessfully challenged Hastings, surprised many when she emerged as the victor in the crowded November primary to succeed the longtime lawmaker who died in April. Running on an unabashedly progressive platform while spending millions of her own dollars, Cherfilus-McCormick defeated several seasoned politicians also running for the seat. Florida was once the perennial swing state. 2022 may prove how red it has become The Democratic primary proved much closer than Tuesday\u2019s contest. Cherfilus-McCormick pulled ahead in the primary by the narrowest of margins \u2013 five votes \u2013 over Broward County Supervisor Dale Holness after a hand recount. Cherfilus-McCormick built her campaign around progressive policies like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. She has also embraced a universal basic income, a policy made popular by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, and has proposed providing $1,000 monthly checks to Americans paid for with tax increases on the wealthy. In Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota has introduced a bill to provide most Americans with a universal basic income, though it hasn\u2019t gained traction. Given the demographics of the district \u2013 it\u2019s one of only two majority Black seats in Florida \u2013 and its voting patterns (Biden won 77% of the vote there in 2020), winning the primary made Cherfilus-McCormick the heavy favorite in Tuesday\u2019s special general election. She also had a significant financial advantage thanks to her personal wealth. She loaned her campaign about $6 million while Mariner had raised about $100,000 through mid-December, according to campaign finance reports. Cherfilus-McCormick is CEO of Trinity Health Care Services, a home health care company in Miramar. On a financial disclosure filed in December, she reported earning $6.4 million in 2021. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis scheduled the election to take place on the first day of the state\u2019s legislative session at a time when many voters were just returning to work from the holidays. Hastings died in April after a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer. His constituents, overwhelmingly Black and Latino, have been without representation in the House for the 280 days since his passing. Democrats accused DeSantis of intentionally delaying a vote to deprive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of critical votes in the narrowly divided chamber. It won\u2019t be long before Cherfilus-McCormick will have to hit the campaign trail again since she\u2019ll have to defend her seat in November. First, though, she\u2019ll have to win the nomination again. Holness, the primary opponent who finished second, has already filed to run in the regularly scheduled Democratic primary for the midterms, setting up a rematch with Cherfilus-McCormick in August. The district boundaries are subject to change when Florida lawmakers finalize new congressional maps this spring. This story has been updated with additional information.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. With the midterms two months away, both parties are ramping up efforts to connect with Latino voters. Republicans are investing in Latino outreach, while Democrats are pumping money into close races. Latino voters may play a key role in elections in Georgia, Florida, Arizona and Texas, and could decide which party gains (or keeps) control of Congress. But so far, Democrats have not mobilized Latinos around the issue of abortion. This failure represents a missed opportunity to make gains in an election in which nearly 12 million Latinos are projected to vote. Although many observers assume that Latinos are social conservatives who oppose the legalization of abortion, the Latino community is evolving, and such perceptions are outdated. Polls show that a majority of Latinos say abortion should be legal in most or all cases. It\u2019s time for Democrats to make abortion rights a reason for Latinos to turn out and vote in the midterms. There is no denying that Latinos have a stake in the debate over abortion access. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion, will disproportionally affect Latinos and undocumented people, human rights groups say. These GOP Latina candidates are not the 'real deal' Although Latinos represent 19% of the US population, they account for 25% of abortion patients, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization on reproductive health that supports abortion rights. Latinos tend to earn less income than other Americans, according to a study by McKinsey & Co., so many Latinas may now have difficulty accessing reproductive health care. Among the states with abortion bans is Texas, home to the second-largest Latino population in the country. Meanwhile, surveys show that most Latinos hold progressive views on abortion. According to the Pew Research Center, 60% of Latinos say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A July Public Religion Research Institute poll found that 75% of Latino Catholics believed that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 72% of Latino Catholics were against overturning Roe v. Wade. These findings present a chance for Democrats to win back some of the Latino support that they lost in 2020. While more than 60% of Latinos voted for President Joe Biden, Latino support for former President Donald Trump went up compared with 2016, and Republicans were able to make inroads with Latinos in South Texas and Florida. Texas governor is cynically using immigrants as props Since then, the conventional wisdom seems to be that Democrats are bleeding Latino support. While that view remains to be seen, Democrats would be smart to contrast their position on abortion with that of the GOP. How can Republicans call themselves \u201cpro-life\u201d when lack of access to a safe and legal abortion can endanger the lives of Latinas? Polling also shows that support for legal abortion is higher among second- and third-generation US Latinos. Given that, on average, 1 million Latinos reach voting age every year, Democrats have the potential to galvanize this demographic. These new voters need to know that their views on abortion access likely align with the Democratic Party. In a state such as Florida, which has a significant Latino population as well as new limits on abortion, this could be critical to Democratic gains. True, faith and family are important to Latinos, and some Latinos welcomed the Dobbs decision. But for many Latinos, their view on abortion is probably similar to that of Biden, who differentiates between his personal Catholic faith and his political opinion on the issue.  Likewise, potential Latino voters may go to Mass regularly and be opposed to abortion; it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they want to limit the rights of others. Democrats should not shy from a message for Latinos centering on this distinction. How ironic that many Latinos\u2019 ancestors came from countries where women were treated as second-class citizens. Now abortion is legal or accessible in Argentina, Cuba, Colombia, Guyana, Uruguay and parts of Mexico, while US Latinas increasingly face the economic, health and social costs of abortion restrictions. Like other Americans, many Latinos were disappointed by the Supreme Court ruling taking away the right to an abortion. Democrats must capitalize on the new political landscape \u2013 and use this backward decision to move forward with Latino voters.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Oren Cass is the executive director at American Compass, a policy shop developing a new conservative economic agenda. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Earlier this summer, a highly unpopular President Joe Biden floundered in the White House. He was facing multiple crises \u2013 Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, crime on America\u2019s streets, record migrant crossings at the southern border, surging gas prices and inflation and stalled economic growth. Polls and forecasts pointed to a Republican Party romp in the upcoming midterms. But Republican candidates failed to capitalize on that momentum, and party strategists are beginning to sweat about their likely margin in the House of Representatives and their chances of winning a Senate majority at all. Candidates and incumbents don\u2019t decide whether gas prices are going up or down, but one important factor they can control is the agenda they present to voters \u2013 their broad priorities and their actual plans. It\u2019s here that Republicans seem determined to sabotage their own chances, by refusing to say anything at all. According to Axios, in the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has reportedly adopted the view that his party should be solely focused on all the \u201cterrible\u201d things the Democrats are doing. Asked what Republicans would do with a congressional majority, he responded, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when we take it back.\u201d In the House of Representatives, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republican Study Committee chairman Jim Banks have made major efforts to develop proposals, but with two months to go before the election, McCarthy\u2019s \u201cCommitment to America\u201d website says nothing but \u201cReturning soon\u2026\u201d Of course, criticism of an opponent\u2019s failings is an important part of any campaign. But an affirmative agenda is the way that candidates demonstrate their own values and priorities, prove their understanding of voters\u2019 problems and a commitment to finding solutions, and model how they would use the power they\u2019re working so hard to acquire. The point of an education plan isn\u2019t to show mastery of education policy or to persuade the very few voters who will pore over its details. The point is to show where education ranks on your list of priorities, what you think is wrong with our schools, how good ones should look and what you think government can do about it. An agenda might also help to explain how this time will be different. Many voters are unhappy with Democrats and itching for change, but it has only been a few years since they were sufficiently fed up with the Republican Congress to throw it out and bring the Democrats in. Will voters actually be ready to make the switch again so soon? Here\u2019s one version of a conservative midterm agenda that might appeal to voters \u2013 focused on the simple theme of helping working families. This help should begin by replacing the existing Child Tax Credit with a more generous family benefit: $250 to $400 per child per month paid to families who are also earning income of their own. Parents should get a 20% bonus if they are married. Opinion: If Democrats don't get serious now, a cruel America may become permanent That\u2019s a policy, but as importantly for a candidate it communicates values: the importance of raising kids, working to support them, and getting and staying married. Opponents will surely argue that a marriage bonus is perverse \u2013 it\u2019s single parents who need the most help \u2013 but a debate over rewarding marriage versus subsidizing its collapse is exactly the sort that conservatives should welcome. And lest all this seem pie-in-the-sky, three Republican senators have already introduced such a proposal, with support from a wide range of conservative organizations and commentators. Next, candidates should promise to give workers more power in the labor market, so that they can earn more and better support their families. One element of that plan should be raising federal minimum wage. Another element should be imposing a robust \u201ce-verify\u201d system that requires employers to confirm the legal status of their employees, with stiff penalties for hiring people who are in the country illegally. Less skilled and lower-wage American workers often suffer when they have to compete against a large pool of undocumented workers willing to work for less, often under the table and in sub-standard conditions; they have more bargaining power when employers lose that option. Enforce the law, raise wages \u2013 not complicated. And yes, this already has a GOP proposal in the Senate as well. Empowering workers also requires equipping them for success, which our education system typically fails to do. According to research that American Compass compiled from the Department of Education and Federal Reserve, only one-in-five young Americans goes smoothly from high school to college to career \u2013 they\u2019re much more likely to never even enroll in college, or to drop out or else land in a job that doesn\u2019t require their degree. So, Republicans have rightly excoriated Biden\u2019s plan to spend approximately $500 billion forgiving the debt of college-goers while doing nothing to fix the unaffordable higher education system. But that criticism would have more weight if paired with some fixes. Policymakers have to eliminate the hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies flowing to higher education, little of which goes to useful instruction. Instead, offer a simple grant worth half the cost of tuition at a public university. Then, take that savings and invest it in other pathways that connect young people with employers and help them gain valuable skills and on-the-job training. A bachelor\u2019s degree is fine, but about 60% of young American workers (age 25 to 34) don\u2019t have one. Millions more Americans would be positioned for success if we focused on getting them to age 20 with work experience, an industry-recognized credential and savings in the bank. Finally, it\u2019s long past time to protect kids on the internet the same way we try to do in the physical world. According to a Pew Research Center study, nearly half of kids report being online \u201calmost constantly,\u201d where they are at risk of encountering all manner of illicit content and exploitation. As their time spent on social media skyrockets, they are also suffering an unprecedented decline in mental health. Neither parents nor our laws would allow kids into the real-world equivalent of these online spaces, but many parents are overwhelmed and ill-equipped, and our laws \u2013 particularly around social media \u2013 are hopelessly outdated, having been written in the 1990s when \u201conline\u201d meant listening to the crackles and squeals of a modem establishing its connection through the family phone line.  A comprehensive agenda here would ensure that online platforms must verify the ages of users and then prohibit those platforms from showing minors inappropriate content. Social media activity for minors would be restricted, and targeted advertising would be banned. Silicon Valley would scream, and no one should care \u2013 when it comes to kids, we don\u2019t ask whether a policy is good for growth or innovation or profits, we ask whether it\u2019s good for kids. A winning GOP agenda might encompass other priorities \u2013 from winning the economic competition with China to bringing back US manufacturing to developing our natural resources. Candidates don\u2019t all have to focus on the same thing. But in the upcoming election, while not being Democrats still looks pretty good, it may not be enough. Support families, empower workers and protect kids. America could get behind that.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jodi Enda is an award-winning political journalist and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. A former White House correspondent, she was the editor in chief of ThinkProgress and an assistant managing editor at CNN, where she oversaw the 2016 election book, Unprecedented: The Election That Changed Everything. The opinions in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. In another era, Liz Cheney would have been exactly the kind of candidate Republican leaders would champion. She has the voting record, the pedigree, the fortitude, the eloquence and the smarts they might look for in the party\u2019s first female presidential nominee. But in this, the Era of Trump, traditional political strengths have been supplanted by blind loyalty to the standard bearer. So it is that Wyoming\u2019s sole member of Congress has become a pariah in her own party, stripped of her House leadership position, expelled by her state\u2019s GOP, widely derided and essentially banished for having the audacity to fight for something conservatives like her used to hold dear: America\u2019s democracy. Because Cheney had the gall to take on Donald Trump and his insurrectionists, the former president has taken on Cheney by promoting her primary challenger. On Tuesday, if the polls are to be believed, Cheney will lose. But shed no tears for Liz Cheney. Her star has never shone more brightly. Cheney is the breakout star of this summer\u2019s blockbuster TV series: the hearings of the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. As the vice chair and one of only two Republicans with the mettle to serve on the committee, Cheney has been granted the lead in hearings that have methodically and dramatically revealed the role that Trump and his sidekicks played in the violent attempt to overturn the election of Joe Biden. She has not minced words as she questioned witnesses \u2013 most of them Republican \u2013 excoriated her fellow party members for their timidity and bluntly warned the nation that Trump poses a \u201cdomestic threat\u201d that is placing the very republic at risk. She has boldly declared that she intends to prevent the former president from becoming a future president. Here, she might get an assist from any of the myriad investigations into Trump\u2019s actions, including a Justice Department probe that led the FBI to remove top-secret and confidential documents from his Florida manse last week. Opinion: Why Trump thinks the FBI search could be a winner for him Cheney\u2019s forthrightness evokes a time when patriotism (occasionally) trumped partisanship and officials (sometimes) worked across the aisle for the greater good. Her bravery in the face of overt hostility has made this conservative\u2019s conservative \u2013 the daughter of the man liberals deemed a political Darth Vader \u2013 the darling of the left. Democrats are hanging on her every word, delighted to the point of giddiness that she has become the point person in what might well be the most consequential congressional panel since Watergate. Progressive donors meanwhile, are rushing to fill her campaign coffers as, in desperation, the congresswoman urges non-Republicans to change their voter registration and cast their primary ballots for her. Unfortunately for Cheney, nearly 73% of Wyoming residents already identify as Republican, and many have made clear to pollsters and journalists that they hold her in contempt. (Cheney has received so many security threats that, even with a special protective detail, she has largely avoided campaigning in the state that has sent her to Congress three times.) Now, as she faces a potential loss, Cheney is being touted as a future presidential candidate. But who would support her? The Democrats who fawn over her oppose pretty much everything Cheney stands for beyond Trump\u2019s threat to the union. After all, she is a rock-ribbed Republican who voted with Trump 93% of the time (and with President Biden less than 18% of the time). Cheney has been a staunch opponent of abortion rights and an advocate for gun ownership, though she was one of just 14 House Republicans to back a bipartisan bill on gun safety in June. She has opposed creating a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, strengthening the Voting Rights Act and reforming the police in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder. Like most of her Republican colleagues, she yearned to repeal Obamacare. On Friday, she extended her broad opposition to Biden\u2019s signature initiatives, voting against legislation to combat global warming, decrease the cost of prescription drugs, raise taxes on wealthy corporations and reduce the federal deficit. Democrats passed the bill without a single Republican vote. Opinion: A seismic shift in Trump's legal woes When she ran for the Senate in 2013 \u2013 a race she ultimately abandoned \u2013 Cheney voiced her opposition to same-sex marriage, though her own sister had married a woman the previous year. Mary Cheney said her sister previously supported her relationship, insinuating that she spouted anti-gay rhetoric to win votes in deep-red Wyoming. (Liz Cheney has since said she was wrong.) And while, with words and attire, she has paid tribute to women\u2019s suffrage and to the young women who have testified about Trump\u2019s behavior on January 6, Cheney never has been a reliable advocate for women\u2019s rights. Just the opposite \u2013 she has voted against such feminist standards as paycheck fairness, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and protecting pregnant employees from workplace discrimination. She was the only congresswoman of either party to oppose the creation of a women\u2019s history museum near the National Mall. Granted, she was one of eight House Republicans who voted to protect access to contraceptives this summer, but her position is less gutsy than pragmatic, as it places her comfortably in the American mainstream. It seems highly unlikely then, that the feminists who extol her fearlessness in the face of the nation\u2019s biggest bully would catapult to the White House a candidate who has tried to thwart them at almost every turn. Ditto the progressives who love her heroism but loathe her policies. Perhaps some moderate Republican women and men would back her, but they are little more than a fading memory in a party now dominated by Trump loyalists. That leaves conservatives, the reliable voters who elected her in years past, who elected her father, Dick Cheney, to the seat she now occupies and stuck with him when he served as George W. Bush\u2019s contentious vice president. To win the GOP nomination for president (or for any other elected office), Cheney needs the conservative voters of her party\u2019s base. But those most Republican of voters are not Cheney people anymore. They are Trumpists. Could she win them back? Over Trump\u2019s dead body.  Still, don\u2019t write off Cheney just yet. She has no shortage of courage or chutzpah. She\u2019s a formidable adversary. Even if she loses this week, she will return to America\u2019s living rooms in September, in the much-anticipated new season of the January 6 committee hearings. She might, as her admirers portend, be sacrificing her political future in order to save the republic. All in all, not a bad trade-off. Then again, perhaps she \u2013 with the help of other democracy lovers \u2013 can salvage them both.",

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Primary elections were held in Nevada, South Carolina, Maine and North Dakota on Tuesday. Much of the attention was on Nevada, where Republicans chose a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud as their nominee to become the state\u2019s top elections official. In South Carolina, voters delivered the vengeance that Trump had sought as they ousted Rep. Tom Rice, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment last year. But In a district near Rice\u2019s, a one-time Trump critic, Rep. Nancy Mace, narrowly survived a challenge from a Trump-endorsed rival \u2013 displaying the difficulty of surviving in a GOP still dominated by the former President without embracing his grievances. A special election in Texas also resulted in a GOP win after Democrat Dan Sanchez conceded to Republican Mayra Flores in a contest for what had long been a Democratic-held House seat. All eyes on are the Federal Reserve as it wraps up a two-day meeting on interest rates today. In a move to fight rampant inflation, the central bank is expected to increase its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point \u2013 the biggest single hike since 1994. This follows the Fed\u2019s decision to raise rates by half a percentage point in May, the biggest increase in 22 years. So, what does this mean for consumers? Experts say every time the Fed raises rates, it becomes more expensive to borrow. That means higher interest costs for mortgages, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, student debt and car loans. Business loans will also get pricier. More than 45 million people are under an enhanced severe weather threat across the Southeast US this morning, where a powerful storm could deliver a triple threat of wind, tornadoes and flooding. Parts of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and the western Carolinas could see damaging winds and a few tornadoes in the coming days, according to the latest forecasts. A flood watch is also in effect for about 2 million people in the region, with some isolated areas getting around 5 inches of rain. The storm system is hitting the region at an unfortunate time, as most areas remain in recovery mode from recent\u00a0 tornadoes and treacherous thunderstorms. At least two people were killed yesterday by the storms, local officials said. The US expects more announcements of weapons and equipment packages to be sent to Ukraine to help in its fight against Russia at a meeting of nearly 50 countries in Brussels today, according to a senior US defense official. Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is gaining ground in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, specifically in the city of Severodonetsk, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting. Without an influx of more weapons, some Ukrainian officials say it will be difficult to halt Russia\u2019s progress or reclaim occupied ground in the region. This, however, could force a tough decision for Western governments, which have offered immense support to Ukraine at an increasing cost to their own economies and national stockpiles of weapons. The Oklahoma legislature yesterday passed a near-total ban on abortion, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. The bill would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both. The legislation passed the state Republican-led House by a 70-14 vote, without debate or questions on the floor. The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who previously promised to sign every bill limiting abortion that came across his desk. This comes as several state legislatures have advanced bills restricting abortion access. Last week, Arizona\u2019s Republican governor signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The inaugural flight of a controversial UK government scheme to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda was stopped on Tuesday at the eleventh hour, after an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights. According to the UK\u2019s PA Media news agency, \u201call migrants have been removed from the plane and the flight to Rwanda will not take off as scheduled tonight.\u201d Britain\u2019s government had announced the deal with the east African country in April. Those people granted asylum would then be allowed to resettle in Rwanda. The government insisted the program was aimed at disrupting people-smuggling networks and deterring migrants from making the dangerous sea journey across the English Channel from France.

View more opinion on CNN. \u201cCan\u2019t we just lie to ourselves for a while?\u201d Glenn Beck, the right-wing talk radio host, was half-joking when he made this suggestion the day after Tuesday\u2019s elections, but he voiced a longing that a number of Republicans had after the midterms: a hope to linger with the visions of a red tsunami that wiped out Democratic power across the country. The reality \u2013 that the party had an unusually poor showing in a midterm that many expected would be a historic blowout \u2013 felt too sour to linger on. For one Republican, though, the night got better and better as it went on. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis won reelection by nearly 20 points, in a night that saw the one-time swing state turn decisively red. As Republican losses piled up over the course of the evening, it became clear that he would not have to share the spotlight \u2013 and that anyone on the right looking for a beacon of hope would have to turn their eyes to Florida. At the DeSantis victory rally, supporters made clear that they saw his winning platform as a springboard. Chants of \u201ctwo more years!\u201d filled the room, a sign that they would rather see DeSantis in the White House than the governor\u2019s mansion come 2025. They weren\u2019t alone. Across right-wing media outlets the day after the election, commentators heaped praise on DeSantis while excoriating former President Donald Trump. Recriminations came swiftly. \u201cTrump Is the Republican Party\u2019s Biggest Loser,\u201d read the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board\u2019s headline, capturing a sentiment repeated on Fox News and right-wing podcasts and radio shows in the days after the election: Trump now carried the stench of losing; DeSantis was the party\u2019s new future. But before declaring this the dawn of DeSantis, remember: It is just as likely the next few weeks will be the high-water mark of his presidential aspirations. The spotlight can very quickly become the hot seat, and DeSantis is both untested as a national candidate and as a Trump adversary. Those who see an easy pivot from the era of Trump to the age of DeSantis are likely in for another wave of disappointment, both because of the particulars of DeSantis\u2019 victory and the persistence of Trump\u2019s power. Opinion: People said voters wouldn't care about this issue. Midterm election results tell a different story On paper, DeSantis looks like Trump\u2019s natural heir. Since winning the governorship by a whisper-thin margin in 2018, he has consciously molded himself after Trump, picking up everything from Trump\u2019s hand gestures and speech cadence to his media-bashing and calculated viciousness. DeSantis leaned into the politics of resentment and resistance, flouting Covid-19 guidelines, attacking schools for teaching about racism and sexuality and dumping asylum-seekers in Massachusetts as part of an anti-immigrant publicity stunt. He has married that political style with a strongman persona. As governor, he has targeted protestors, universities, public health workers and corporations for opposing his policies. He has sent police to round up voters with felony convictions who, confused by the state\u2019s efforts to strip their voting rights after voters reinstated them a few years ago, mistakenly voted in recent elections. He has bent the Florida legislature to his will, whipping up support for anti-gay laws, a new redistricting map and punitive legislation targeting Disney after the company criticized the state\u2019s infamous \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill. Such actions bolstered his popularity in Florida, as did his attention to public opinion. He introduced a gas-tax holiday in the month before the election, and focused on effective hurricane relief rather than campaigning in the wake of the recent storm. As a result, he appears to have won not only traditional conservatives in the state but also made more headway with Latino voters and voters in more Democratic areas like Miami-Dade. If the dream for many on the right was Trumpism without Trump, DeSantis seems to be the ideal politician to carry them into that future. Opinion: A rising star for the Democrats But as Sen. Marco Rubio, a one-time frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, knows, neither success in Florida nor success in theory naturally translates into national victory. Part of that is due to the particulars of Florida. The electorate there has been trending more conservative in recent years, even as the country as a whole has coalesced around center-left policies (note how even many red states now vote for Medicaid expansion, abortion protections and higher minimum wage laws). Meanwhile, unlike the national party, the Democratic Party in Florida is in tatters, struggling to field and support candidates and to organize and mobilize voters. And Florida has a specific mix of Latino voters that is unlike most other states, weighted heavily toward immigrants from Cuba and Venezuela who respond favorably to DeSantis\u2019s attack on Democrats as socialists. Then there is the issue of fellow Florida resident Donald Trump. The Dump Trump crowd, though bigger at the moment than at perhaps any time since 2016, does not seem to fully understand how deep and unquestioning the cult of personality around Trump still is within parts of the party. Just two years ago, the party failed to pass a policy platform, instead issuing a statement of loyalty to Trump. When party elites inched away from Trump after his election loss and the insurrection that followed, they did not manage to bring the party with them. Instead, the majority of Republicans in the House voted to overturn the election and the vast majority of Republican voters clung to the belief that the 2020 election was stolen.  The DeSantis bubble has also inflated during a period in which Trump has been relatively absent from the national scene. DeSantis has not yet had to contend with Trump\u2019s peculiar media power, his ability to create noise and spectacle and soak up every moment of media attention. Nor has he been on the other side of a sustained Trump attack. Sure, DeSantis may find a way to win in a head-to-head fight with Trump \u2013 but it is just as easy to imagine him instantly wilting in Trump\u2019s presence, as all the other Republican presidential candidates did in the 2016 primaries. Now, it\u2019s possible that while a violent insurrection could not break the base\u2019s loyalty to Trump, an uninterrupted losing streak could. DeSantis is certainly better positioned than any other Republican in the country to challenge Trump for the nomination, especially since he has attracted broad support from Republican elites and right-wing media. Trump, however, has an exceptional track record against such odds. Which means that the dream of a DeSantis victory in 2024 may prove just as elusive and illusory as Tuesday\u2019s red wave.",

For a man so schooled in Sophistry that truth has no meaning, it\u2019s hard to imagine more meaningful words from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson than when he warned that \u201cthe consequences for the world are absolutely catastrophic\u201d if Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine prevailed in Ukraine. He\u2019s absolutely right about that. Right too when he described Ukraine as being on a \u201cknife-edge\u201d during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit in Bavaria this week. Which is odd. Because Johnson has two things in common with Putin that serve the Russian president\u2019s strategic aims far more than his support for Ukraine threatens them. Ukrainians are dying for the right to join the European Union \u2013 an international body Johnson fought to leave, and that Putin\u2019s worked hard to undermine. Ukrainians are also seeking the protections afforded by international law \u2013 the rules-based global order that Johnson is proudly tearing apart \u2013 not unlike the former KGB boss who now runs Russia and who illegally annexed Crimea and invaded Ukraine. The country that has stood up to Putin\u2019s invasion is now feeding its young into a Russian meat grinder that\u2019s slowly chewing its way into territory in the east. Soldiers \u2013 both Ukrainians and foreign volunteers \u2013 repeat with ever more anxious voices, that Ukraine is losing its best men. That Russia\u2019s sheer mass is prevailing and above all it needs NATO\u2019s best weapons \u2013 and yesterday. Johnson\u2019s been telling his own nation what \u201cwe must steel ourselves for a long war, as Putin resorts to a campaign of attrition, trying to grind down Ukraine by sheer brutality,\u201d in a recent Sunday Times article. The British Prime Minister has made two pilgrimages to Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, where he\u2019s promised arms, money, and unwavering diplomatic support for President Volodomyr Zelensky. \u201cThe price of backing down, the price of allowing Putin to succeed, to hack off huge parts of Ukraine, to continue with his program of conquest, that price will be far, far higher. Everybody here understands that,\u201d Johnson said in an interview on the sidelines of the G7 summit. Ukrainians, he said, are facing real pressures, they\u2019re having to source energy from elsewhere, but they\u2019re doing it and making the effort and making the sacrifice. That\u2019s because they see that the \u201cprice for the freedom is worth paying,\u201d he added. Opinion: 'Show them our pecs!' The G7 'boys club' is back Johnson has long sought to channel Second World War-era British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. But he\u2019s convincing very few, no matter how welcome he\u2019s made in Kyiv, that he understands that many of the freedoms Ukrainians seek lie within the EU. In 2016, Johnson galvanized support for leaving the EU with a mendacious campaign that pledged, erroneously, that \u00a3350 billion ($425 billion) of money sent to Europe would come back into the Bank of England. Johnson promised \u201csunlit uplands\u201d for the green and pleasant land. But today the sceptered isle is more septic island. The freedom to work anywhere in the bloc \u2013 one now lost to Britons. The freedom of access to a market of half a billion people, now also lost to Britons. For years Johnson, the disheveled political magus, was the golden boy of Britain\u2019s Conservative Party. A favorite of comedy shows; the faux bumbling of Johnson delivered Brexit and a landslide general election win. According to his sister, Rachel, a young Johnson said he wanted to be \u201cworld king.\u201d As an adult he\u2019s had to settle his ambitions at being Britain\u2019s head of government. And he stopped at very little to achieve that aim. But in June Johnson\u2019s political crown slipped over face when his Conservative party was wiped out in two by-elections. He has survived one vote within his party to unseat him. But may soon face another as Tory back benchers are reportedly trying to change the rules \u2013 meaning he could be kicked out in another confidence vote inside 12 months. These domestic travails may explain his passionate interest in Ukraine. But he\u2019s studiously avoided any mention of the essence of its fight with Russia which is, deep down, Ukraine\u2019s desire to join the European Union. Why more air travel chaos is on its way Meanwhile Britain is struggling with the near implosion of an airline industry facing cancellations of international flights and luggage mountains at Heathrow Airport. The legal system is in disarray as barristers go on strike over claims that their net earnings are below the UK\u2019s minimum wage. Railway workers have staged walk outs and threatened more. Teachers too are on the verge of taking action as inflation surges ahead of wage increases. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says the UK economy will grow at 3.6% this year and not at all next year. Only Russia will do worse, the 38-country organization says in its latest report. It\u2019s shrinking at 4.1%. But it has the expenses of invading Ukraine and the consequences of punitive international sanctions to blame. Britain\u2019s economic malaise can\u2019t all be blamed on Brexit. Global growth has slowed due to Russia\u2019s \u201cunprovoked aggression\u201d the OECD says. It\u2019s slumped to 3% this year and is expected to dwindle to 2.8% in 2023. Covid-19 has taken its toll too. But the UK\u2019s GDP growth was the highest in the G7 a little over a year ago. Its slide to 19 out of 20 in the OECD rankings of G20 countries must be partly attributable to the supply chain chaos, slowed trade, shortage of labor across the board and decline in investment which has followed Brexit. For all his crowing about being the prime minister to break the political deadlock and \u201cGet Brexit Done,\u201d Johnson\u2019s government has failed to secure a trade deal with Brussels. On top of that his government has published a bill that will tear up the one deal it has managed to do with the EU, the Northern Ireland Protocol, which Johnson himself negotiated and signed. Doing so will almost certainly breach international law. Plans to impose tariffs on steel imports to the UK risk breaking World Trade Organization Rules. And risks a trade war with steel-producing China, India and Turkey. Opinion: Dear Prince Charles, don't shake hands with the tyrant who kidnapped our father Incensed by a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which stopped Britain sending asylum seekers from England to Rwanda, Johnson\u2019s government is now threatening to leave its jurisdiction. The World Trade Organization (WTO), the child of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was a very British vision. The Northern Ireland Protocol is a British-EU treaty intended to secure the Good Friday Agreement which brought peace to Northern Ireland. Ripping into the fabric of these contracts undermines Britain\u2019s standing in the world. A British Prime Minister\u2019s threat to leave the ECHR, a court the British helped set up to establish a pan-European legal system to prevent atrocities in Europe in the wake of the Second World War, must seem bizarre to Ukrainians. They\u2019d no doubt love a bit of ECHR right now. Ukrainian investigators will seek the help of international organizations to pursue alleged war criminals. It\u2019s as committed to joining international organizations like the EU as Johnson is to leaving them. Indeed it\u2019s Ukraine\u2019s desire to join the EU that provoked the revolution against pro-Putin anti-EU president Victor Yanukovich in 2014. That same desire is probably the biggest reason for Putin\u2019s invasion. Though his stated excuse for a brazen abuse of international law was to \u201cde-Nazify\u201d Ukraine and stop the country joining NATO. But a democratic, free, EU member state on Putin\u2019s doorstep with a substantial Russian-speaking population is the sort of personal existential threat that must conjure up the images of Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Gadhafi\u2019s ignominious demise. No dictator wants to end their rule with a bayonet up the backside. \u201cWe all know the Ukrainians are willing to die for the European perspective. We want them to live with the European dream,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the EU Commission President said.  That\u2019s not a cause Johnson can understand. And he doesn\u2019t ever mention it. Instead, at the NATO meeting in Madrid this week he\u2019s talking of \u201callies \u2013 all allies\u201d needing to \u201cdig deep\u201d and meet NATO\u2019s needs with additional defense spending. It\u2019s not a new argument and one NATO members will listen to. But not from a British Prime Minister who\u2019s in trouble at home and cannot be trusted to keep even written promises abroad.",

The Oklahoma legislature yesterday passed a near-total ban on abortion, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. The bill would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both. The legislation passed the state Republican-led House by a 70-14 vote, without debate or questions on the floor. The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who previously promised to sign every bill limiting abortion that came across his desk. This comes as several state legislatures have advanced bills restricting abortion access. Last week, Arizona\u2019s Republican governor signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria.

Former President Donald Trump and a right-wing lawyer were part of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot alleged in a court filing yesterday. The 61-page filing is part of an attempt to gain access to emails from lawyer John Eastman, who the committee says helped Trump orchestrate the plot. House members have also signaled they may make a criminal referral to the Justice Department about Trump, depending on their findings. To date, no top advisers around Trump have been charged for crimes related to the attack on the US Capitol.

            "article_content": "Ruwa Romman remembers the sadness she felt as an 8-year-old girl sitting in the back of a school bus watching classmates point to her house and erupt in vicious laughter. \u201cThere\u2019s the bomb lab,\u201d they jeered in yet another attempt to brand her family as terrorists. On Tuesday, the same girl \u2013 now a 29-year-old community organizer \u2013 made history as the first known Muslim woman elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, and the first Palestinian American elected to any office in the state. After 10 months of relentless campaigning, the Democrat said she is eager to begin representing the people of District 97, which includes Berkeley Lake, and parts of Duluth, Norcross, and Peachtree Corners in Gwinnett County. As an immigrant, the granddaughter of Palestinian refugees, and a Muslim woman who wears the hijab, or Islamic headscarf, the road to political office hasn\u2019t been easy, especially in the very Christian and conservative South. \u201cI could write chapters about what I have gone through,\u201d Romman told CNN, listing the many ways she\u2019s faced bigotry or discrimination. \u201cAll the times I am \u2018randomly\u2019 selected by TSA, teachers putting me in a position where I had to defend Islam and Muslims to classrooms being taught the wrong things about me and my identity\u2026 it colored my entire life.\u201d A Marine who hated Muslims went to a mosque to plant a bomb. His intended victims ended up saving his life But those hardships only fueled her passion for civic engagement, especially among marginalized communities, Romman said. \u201cWho I am has really taught me to look for the most marginalized because they are the ones who don\u2019t have resources or time to spend in the halls of political institutions to ask for the help they need,\u201d she said. Romman began in 2015 working with the Georgia Muslim Voter Project to increase voter turnout among local Muslim Americans. She also helped establish the state chapter for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization. Soon after, Romman began working with the wider community. Her website boasts: \u201cRuwa has volunteered in every election cycle since 2014 to help flip Georgia blue.\u201d She said her main focus is \u201cputting public service back into politics,\u201d which she intends to do by helping expand access to health care, bridging the economic opportunity gap, protecting the right to vote, and making sure people have access to lifesaving care like abortion. \u201cI think a lot of people overlook state legislators because they think they\u2019re local and don\u2019t have a lot of impact, not realizing that state legislatures have the most direct impact on them,\u201d Romman said. \u201cEvery law that made us mad or happy started in the state legislature somewhere.\u201d Romman said she always wanted to influence the political process, but never thought she\u2019d be a politician. The decision to run for office came after attending a Georgia Muslim Voter Project training session for women from historically marginalized communities, where a journalist covering the event asked if she wanted to run for office. \u201cI told her no, I don\u2019t think so, and she ended up writing a beautiful piece about Muslim women in Georgia, but she started it with \u2018Ruwa Romman is contemplating a run for office,\u2019 and I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Romman recounted. \u201cBut when it came out, the community saw it and the response was so overwhelmingly positive and everyone kept telling me to do it.\u201d Two weeks later, Romman and a group of volunteers launched a campaign. She was surrounded by family, friends and community members who were rooting for her success. Together, they knocked on 15,000 doors, sent 75,000 texts, and made 8,000 phone calls. Her Republican opponent John Chan didn\u2019t fight fair, she said. \u201cMy opponent had used anti-Muslim rhetoric against me, saying I had ties to terrorism, at one point flat-out supporting an ad that called me a terrorist plant,\u201d she said. Flyers supporting Chan\u2019s candidacy insinuated she is associated with terrorist organizations. Chan did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. It was the same type of bullying Romman faced as a schoolgirl, she said. Only this time, she wasn\u2019t alone. Thousands of people had her back. \u201cWhat was incredible is that people in my district sent his messaging to me and said \u2018This is unacceptable. How can we help? How can we get involved? How can we support you?\u2019 and that was such an incredible moment for me,\u201d she said. It was also ironic, Romman added, because her passion for her community and social justice is rooted in her faith: \u201cJustice is a central tenant of Islam,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cIt inspires me to be good to others, care for my neighbors, and protect the marginalized.\u201d It\u2019s also rooted in her family\u2019s experience as Palestinian refugees, who she said were banished from their homeland by Israel in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. \u201cMy Palestinian identify has instilled in me a focus on justice and care for others,\u201d Romman said. \u201cEveryone deserves to live with dignity. I hope that Palestinians everywhere see this as proof that consistently showing up and working hard can be history making. \u201cI may not have much power on foreign policy, but I sincerely hope that I can at least remind people that Palestinians are not the nuisance, or the terrorists, or any other terrible aspersion that society has put on us,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are real people with real dreams.\u201d Romman joins three other Muslim Americans elected to state and local office in Georgia this election cycle, according to the Georgia Muslim Voter Project. The other three candidates, all Democrats, were Nabilah Islam, the first known Muslim woman elected to the Georgia State Senate, Sheikh Rahman, elected to the Georgia State Senate, and Farooq Mughal, elected to the Georgia State House. 'Those people are not me' \u201cWe\u2019ve had Muslim representation at the state level in Georgia, but these wins take representation for Georgia Muslims further than ever before because now we have more gender and ethnic representation for Muslims,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director Shafina Khabani told CNN. \u201cNot only will we have a representation that looks like us and aligns with our values, but we will have an opportunity to advocate and influence policies that impact our communities directly.\u201d \u201cHaving diversity in political representation means better laws, more accepting leadership, and welcoming policies for all of Georgia,\u201d she said. More than anything, Romman hopes her election points to a future free of hate and bigotry. \u201cI think this proves that people have learned that Muslims are part of this community and that tide of Islamophobia is hopefully starting to recede,\u201d Romman added. Looking back at her childhood, Romman wishes she could tell her younger self things would get better with time, and that one day she would not only make Georgia history, but hopefully a real difference in the world.",

            "article_content": "The candidates running for election chief in the battleground state of Georgia sparred Tuesday over the impact of the state\u2019s controversial 2021 election law and their records defending the right to vote. The contest features one of the country\u2019s best-known secretaries of state \u2013 Republican Brad Raffensperger, who famously rebuffed Donald Trump\u2019s request to \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn his loss in the Peach State. His refusal \u2013 and later star turn as a witness before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol \u2013 has burnished his reputation as a defender of election integrity as he seeks a second term. Record turnout and long lines mark first day of early voting in Georgia \u201cI\u2019ve had to stand up to incredible pressure,\u201d the Republican said during Tuesday\u2019s debate, sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. \u201cMany people buckled and folded. I didn\u2019t, and I won\u2019t.\u201d His Democratic challenger, state Rep. Bee Nguyen, argued that Georgia\u2019s controversial election law, SB202 \u2013 which Raffensperger supports \u2013 has erected new hurdles for the state\u2019s voters and election workers. This midterm marks the first major election carried out in the state since the law was enacted. It prompted denunciations from civil rights groups and corporate leaders, including a decision by Major League Baseball to relocate its All-Star Game from Atlanta. Among other things, the law added new voter identification requirements to cast ballots by mail, imposed limits on the availability of ballot drop boxes and made it a crime for third-party groups to hand out food and water to voters as they wait in line at polling places. SB202 also made it explicit that any individual voter could challenge the eligibility of an unlimited number of other Georgians, unleashing tens of thousands of voter challenges from conservative activists in recent months. And although most have been dismissed, they have consumed election workers\u2019 time and attention as they also tried to prepare for the general election.   On Tuesday, Nguyen said she would work to repeal the provisions of the law that \u201chave added additional burden on our election workers,\u201d including the mass challenges. She said she also would develop a plan to protect poll workers and their family members from harassment. Raffensperger said the legislature should \u201creform\u201d that provision to avert \u201cfrivolous challenges\u201d that \u201cjust gum up the works.\u201d But he also defended efforts to ensure the state\u2019s voting rolls are accurate and pointed to strong turnout during Georgia\u2019s first day of early voting Monday to rebut claims that the law had suppressed voting in the state. He said nearly double the number of voters had cast ballots on the first day of early in-person voting than had done so during the last midterm election four years ago. In an election year in which GOP voters in several key states have rallied behind secretary of state nominees who back Trump\u2019s falsehoods about a stolen election, Raffensperger is one of the few politicians to buck Trump and survive to the general election. In May, he pulled off a major political upset by beating his Trump-endorsed challenger, Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, outright in the primary without needing to win a runoff. That national profile has made him a tougher target for Nguyen, who has been a rising political star in her own right. She has put expanding access to the ballot at the center of her candidacy. The daughter of Vietnamese refugees also is seeking to make history by becoming the first Asian American elected to a statewide political office in this increasingly racially and ethnically diverse state. On the stump and again on the debate stage Tuesday, Nguyen seized on Raffensperger\u2019s views on abortion in an attempt to gain ground.   When he was a state lawmaker, Raffensperger sponsored a resolution that proposed a constitutional amendment to recognize \u201cthe paramount right to life of all human beings as persons at any stage of development.\u201d The measure failed, and Raffensperger argues his position on abortion is not relevant to the job he now holds. During the televised face-off with Raffensperger and libertarian Ted Metz, Nguyen said: \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate on this stage who is both pro-choice and pro-democracy.\u201d She also cast Raffensperger\u2019s office as mishandling an investigation into a breach of the election office in Coffee County, Georgia. As previously reported by CNN, recently released surveillance video shows a Republican county official escorted two operatives working with an attorney for Trump into the county\u2019s election offices on the same day a voting system there had been breached. Raffensperger\u2019s office initially expressed skepticism about the breach. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is now investigating, and Raffensperger last month said his office would replace voting equipment in the county. \u201cIt\u2019s been 21 months and no one has been held criminally accountable,\u201d Nguyen said Tuesday. Raffensperger said he believes that \u201cwhat happened in Coffee County will have a thorough investigation and people that broke the law should be held accountable and sent to jail.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Fifteen minutes into a recent Sunday service, a man in a trim pinstriped suit with coiffed white hair and a blue disposable mask strolled to the front row of The Fountain church and began nodding along to a live and loud contemporary gospel band. \u201cIs that Charlie Crist?\u201d Virginia McNair, a local retiree, whispered from a few rows back at this predominantly Black church. \u201cMy favorite.\u201d It was Charlie Crist \u2013 that instantly recognizable, enduring enigma of Florida politics \u2013 in his element: campaigning. At age 65, Crist, currently serving his third term in the US House, is running for governor, a job he first won in 2006 as a Republican, left after losing a 2010 US Senate race as an independent, and failed to win back in 2014 as a Democrat. And he\u2019s doing it the only way he knows how: by trying to shake every hand in the state. In 36 hours, he attended the Sunday service, spoke to parents of children killed by gun violence, huddled with Nicaraguan refugees, lunched with Haitian American Democrats and toured Cuban American businesses in Little Havana with his new fianc\u00e9e. Florida was once the perennial swing state. 2022 may prove how red it has become Democrats in Florida, entirely shut out of state government for more than two decades, are desperate for power to slow the state\u2019s rightward lurch, but they face a fundraising juggernaut and rising GOP star in Gov. Ron DeSantis. Meanwhile, the country is souring on President Joe Biden, and some Democratic candidates are distancing themselves from their standard-bearer heading into the midterm elections. Crist, though, is not just embracing Biden, he is channeling the President\u2019s campaign playbook. Like Biden in 2020, he\u2019s running on reestablishing civility, a bet that enough independent and moderate GOP voters are exhausted by the divisive politics of the incumbent Republican administration. Crist is playing up his bipartisan background \u2013 at times, even leaning into his Republican roots \u2013 in hopes voters will rally around a familiar face with a track record of working across the aisle. A year ago, Crist\u2019s entrance into the race was met with a sigh from many state Democrats ready for younger blood and fresh faces. But as mail ballots for the August 23 primary are sent out in many Florida counties, party forces have coalesced around Crist\u2019s strategy. With about five weeks left before the primary, Crist has built a solid fundraising advantage and has endorsements from more than 100 elected Democratic officials and the backing of labor unions and progressive leaders alike. Crist on Thursday released his first statewide ad of the campaign focused on DeSantis \u2013 not his main primary opponent, state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried. In another sign Crist is already readying for the general election, his campaign has made an eight-figure reservation of airtime for the fall, CNN has learned. \u201cWhoever has the best chance is who we have to nominate,\u201d said state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, an Orlando Democrat and LGBT leader who endorsed Crist last month. \u201cThe stakes are just too high.\u201d Biden framed the 2020 race as a \u201cbattle for the soul of America.\u201d Crist, who has mentioned the Golden Rule at campaign stops for more than a decade, framed the race as \u201cnot right versus left, it\u2019s right versus wrong.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a similarity, of course,\u201d Crist told CNN. \u201cGood experience, caring heart \u2013 I think people are hungry for that.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m a Floridian,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd, God bless the President, but he\u2019s from Delaware.\u201d Thomas Kennedy, a Miami activist and Democratic National Committee member known for disrupting DeSantis events, said he thinks Crist is a good foil for DeSantis, a conservative favorite who has brought former President Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational style to Tallahassee. \u201cPeople are tired of the toxicity and partisanship,\u201d Kennedy said at the event where Crist vowed to help Nicaraguan immigrants gain temporary protected states to remain in the US. \u201cThere\u2019s so much meanness in the state right now. He\u2019s similar to Biden.\u201d Not everyone is on board. Fried, the lone Democrat in statewide elected office, has built her campaign around the promise \u201cSomething new.\u201d Her allies are quick to point out that Crist as the Democratic nominee in 2014 couldn\u2019t beat then-Gov. Rick Scott and that though Biden\u2019s strategy proved successful in his 2020 race, he lost Florida to Trump by a healthy margin. Fried, meanwhile, won office four years ago in a cycle that saw all other Democrats running statewide lose. \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome, and our party has a history of that insanity,\u201d said Evan Ross, a Democratic consultant and Fried supporter with deep ties to South Florida\u2019s large Jewish community. \u201cCharlie Crist would be the pinnacle of it. If we\u2019re crazy enough to nominate him, I think it will be one of our worst losses in state history.\u201d Gavin Newsom goes on the air against Ron DeSantis as political rivalry grows Crist dismissed 2014 as a bad year for Democrats everywhere. He noted that he lost the race by less than 1 percentage point and has since outperformed the top of the Democratic ticket three times en route to winning his purple-hued House seat in the Tampa Bay area. Crist\u2019s advisers have also vowed a robust campaign by Democrats this year, unlike 2020 when Democrats acknowledge Biden was more focused on other battleground states. Asked what he had learned from his last statewide defeat, Crist responded: \u201cGo to north Florida more.\u201d But even some Crist supporters question if his brand of politics can win a head-to-head battle against DeSantis, who is seeking a blowout victory to bolster his resume before a possible 2024 run for president. \u201cAll of Charlie\u2019s success was by being nice. And that works until it doesn\u2019t. The Republicans, they don\u2019t play around,\u201d said John Morgan, an Orlando lawyer and longtime friend of Crist. \u201cThere\u2019s not a mean bone in Charlie\u2019s body. DeSantis is a brawler with brass knuckles in one hand and a switchblade in the other.\u201d CNN has reached out to DeSantis\u2019 campaign for comment. On the Saturday before his church appearance, Crist donned a traditional Cuban guayabera shirt and roamed the festive streets of Little Havana in Miami wide-eyed and curious, despite it being an iconic stop for past Florida campaigns, including his own. A Cuban band had serenaded him and Arizona Sen. John McCain there in 2006. He paraded through it in a convertible in 2007. He opened a campaign office there in 2014. Inside a Cuban coffee shop, Crist watched a worker roast beans and then introduced himself to patrons, including Matt Granat, a graphic designer from Palm Beach Gardens, who had identified the former governor from across the room. Out of earshot from Crist, Granat told CNN he was leaning toward voting for Fried. \u201cShe strikes me as someone who has been a thorn in the side of DeSantis,\u201d Granat said. \u201cHe\u2019s switched parties, so I\u2019m not sure about him.\u201d Ten minutes later, Crist returned after meeting a dozen other people and handed Granat a bumper sticker. \u201cMatt, I want you to have this.\u201d Granat looked impressed: \u201cWow, he remembered my name.\u201d \u201cYou need name ID to do this thing in a state this size,\u201d Crist later told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be recognized unless you\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve done.\u201d As Crist leans on old connections and a personal touch, Fried has built on an online following through late-night Twitter chats with her audience, sharply edited videos highlighting Crist\u2019s Republican past and capturing viral moments on the campaign trail. The two will debate for the first and only time on July 21. \u201cCharlie has been doing this for 30 years. He has relationships that go back decades,\u201d Fried said. \u201cAnd a lot of my relationships are newer and people know I\u2019m not a typical Democrat, meaning I stand up for things differently, I talk differently and I don\u2019t play internal party politics. And unfortunately that\u2019s what Charlie does. I don\u2019t play games. He offers positions to people, he cuts deals, and I\u2019m not willing to do that.\u201d Fried has seized on the Democratic outrage over the US Supreme Court eliminating the federal right to an abortion to jump-start a campaign that has been beset by staff shake-ups, lackluster fundraising and an ethics complaint over past income disclosures. She said that as a woman, she is uniquely situated to capture this reinvigorated wave of energy from Democratic voters. \u201cI\u2019m talking to a lot of women from across the state,\u201d Fried said. \u201cThey\u2019ve all turned to me with a collective voice, saying, \u2018You have to win, you\u2019re our protector and our fighter.\u2019\u201d Crist, meanwhile, has a complicated and conflicting history on abortion. He has called himself \u201cpro-life\u201d in the past. He explained to a Florida television station earlier this year, \u201cI\u2019m still pro-life, meaning I\u2019m for life. I hope most people are.\u201d He recently said he regretted appointing to the state Supreme Court a pair of justices who have ruled to uphold abortion restrictions. Yet, Crist has been a reliable vote for abortion rights in the House, and he has secured endorsements from Barbara Zdravecky, the former CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida, and Alex Sink, the state\u2019s former elected chief financial officer who founded an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women who support abortion rights to run for office. \u201cI just think he\u2019s certainly best prepared to be governor and do the things we need him to do,\u201d said Sink, who lost a bid to succeed Crist as governor in 2010. \u201cBut also he\u2019s best prepared to win and raise the money to wage the fight against DeSantis.\u201d In Florida, both sides in abortion fight wait to see how far DeSantis will go State Rep. Anna Eskamani, an outspoken advocate for abortion rights, was publicly dismissive of Crist\u2019s gubernatorial run when he first announced in May of last year, tepidly calling him \u201cbetter than DeSantis.\u201d But Crist worked to convince her of his progressive bona fides. They held events together to oppose a state bill that would curb residential solar power and to fight DeSantis\u2019 tax policies. Eskamani was surprised how many people who showed up knew Crist. \u201cThat name ID, of course, it can trigger different emotions, there\u2019s that trust there and it reminds me of Joe Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t predict we would be there, but this is Florida.\u201d Much as Biden did, the Crist campaign is banking that his familiarity with Black Floridians will carry him through the primary. Black voters make up 30% of registered Democrats in the state and have been instrumental in determining the party\u2019s nominee in past elections. Despite earning the moniker \u201cChain Gang Charlie\u201d for championing the return of chained prison work crews as a state senator in the 1990s, Crist has built long-standing connections with African American and Caribbean American state leaders. At the lunch with Haitian American Democrats, state Rep. Marie Paule Woodson, who was born in Haiti, gave a full-throated backing of Crist and laid out the stakes for November. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wake up and help Charlie be the next governor, every single one of you will be sitting in the back of the bus,\u201d she said. Crist backs legalization and decriminalization of marijuana and has promised to restore the voting rights of felons who have served their sentences. But as he positions himself for the general election, Crist has also sought to distance himself from some of the more divisive rhetoric on policing from his party\u2019s left flank. At a breakfast hosted by Florida Parents of Murdered Children, a predominantly Black advocacy group for families victimized by homicide, Crist received an unexpected turn at the lectern, when he called on the room to recognize a table of police officers. He promised as governor to put funding into law enforcement to stop \u201cthese horrible crimes that happen all over our country.\u201d \u201cWe know that sometimes, you know, strange things have happened in law enforcement like in Minneapolis, and George Floyd, but you\u2019re good,\u201d Crist said to the table. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d Florida is losing two Black-led congressional districts Aramis Ayala, Florida\u2019s first Black state attorney and the event\u2019s keynote speaker, appeared stunned by Crist\u2019s remarks. Ayala, who earned a reputation as a reformer, once published a list of officers who couldn\u2019t be trusted to testify in criminal cases. During her turn at the microphone, she called out the \u201cmass incarceration of Black and brown people.\u201d By then, Crist was on his way to his next event. Asked by CNN about Crist\u2019s remarks, Ayala, who is running for Florida attorney general, said: \u201cEach person has to have their own message. If he\u2019s the governor, he has to explain what he\u2019s going to do, and I must explain what I would do.\u201d She declined to say which Democratic candidate she intends to vote for in August. Fried has earned the endorsement of the Democratic Black Caucus of Florida and the Florida College Democrats, signaling that her campaign has gained a foothold with the party\u2019s grassroots. Camara Williams, a Florida attorney and community organizer, recently hosted both candidates on his Black culture and politics podcast. He told CNN he was unimpressed by Crist\u2019s folksy one-liners and thought the Democrat was relying on a dated mentality for getting Black voters to the polls. Crist said he would bring former President Barack Obama to campaign for him. When Williams suggested some Black voters think DeSantis has helped their economic standing by keeping businesses open during most of the pandemic, Crist scoffed. \u201cDoubtful,\u201d Crist said. \u201cNot for you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard Black voters say that,\u201d Williams responded. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy, man,\u201d Crist replied. He ultimately cut the interview shorter than the requested hour. Williams this past week endorsed Fried. The two clicked during a wonky 70-minute interview that touched on Black farming, generational wealth and marijuana policy. In an interview last month with CNN, Williams said he felt Crist lacked authenticity and was underestimating DeSantis. \u201cHe may hold a fond place in some African American voters\u2019 hearts, but if you think that\u2019s going to bring tailwinds to get people interested in your campaign, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Williams said. \u201cDeSantis will do a good job of messaging to a certain sector of Black voters because of economics. You have to address that.\u201d Crist shrugged off the criticism. Black voters know him, he insisted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he feels that way,\u201d Crist said of Williams. \u201cHe has a right to his opinion. But he doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d",

The nation recently faced a jarring split screen: In Washington, DC, witnesses before the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol described then-President Donald Trump\u2019s unrelenting pressure on his vice president to overturn his 2020 election loss \u2013 even as an angry mob threatened Mike Pence. And nearly 2,000 miles away in rural New Mexico, a group of Republican county commissioners set off alarms over potential election sabotage last week when they declined to certify the results of this month\u2019s primary election in Otero County, citing unfounded claims about the security of voting machines and questions about a handful of ballots. The showdown in New Mexico \u2013 along with the growing number of election deniers winning GOP primaries in this year\u2019s midterms \u2013 demonstrates how falsehoods about election administration spread by Trump and his allies have \u201cpenetrated all levels of governments and certain segments of the public,\u201d said Jonathan Diaz, senior legal counsel for voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. Last week, Republican Jim Marchant, who has said he would not have certified the 2020 election results in his state, won his party\u2019s nomination for secretary of state in Nevada, a key presidential battleground. And, over the weekend, Republican activists meeting in Texas for the state party convention approved a resolution that rejects President Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election \u2013 in another sign of GOP fealty to Trump\u2019s election falsehoods. For months now, pockets of rebellion against normal election operations have been building around the country as GOP-led county commissions weigh extreme ideas, such as yanking vote-tallying machines and returning to hand-counting ballots. Election clerks and experts warn that would throw the US election system into chaos, given the impracticality of counting millions of votes by hand. At the same time, law enforcement officials have investigated growing incidents of unauthorized people attempting to gain access to the voting systems targeted in the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to challenge his defeat. But the standoff in Otero County rocketed to national attention when New Mexico\u2019s Democratic secretary of state, Maggie Toulouse Oliver, sought a state Supreme Court order last week to force the GOP commissioners sign off on the June 7 primary results after they had initially refused to do so. On Friday, the statutory deadline for counties to certify the primary results, the Otero commissioners relented and certified the results by a 2-1 vote, citing the high court\u2019s order and threats of legal action from state Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat. But Otero County wasn\u2019t the only New Mexico community that witnessed defiance. Officials in Torrance County, New Mexico, another Republican stronghold, also waited until the very last day to certify their county\u2019s election results. When they did so, during a raucous public meeting, cries of \u201ctraitors\u201d and \u201ccowards\u201d broke out from the crowd. Joanna Lydgate \u2013 the CEO of States United Action, a nonpartisan group working on fair and secure elections \u2013 views the confrontations in New Mexico as a sign of the growing peril American democracy faces. A multi-pronged attack on democracy is underway, she said, as election deniers seek key offices, state legislatures transform the ground rules for running elections and partisan actors test ways to change election results if they \u201cdon\u2019t like the outcome.\u201d \u201cI think we all remember watching the attack on the Capitol and that it felt like the darkest day,\u201d Lydgate added. \u201cBut the truth is that the threats to democracy didn\u2019t end on January 6. Really, what we\u2019ve seen since then is an insurrection in the states that hasn\u2019t been televised.\u201d Washington, DC, and Virginia are holding primary elections Tuesday, and runoffs are underway in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia. (There are no statewide or congressional runoffs in Arkansas.) I\u2019m keeping an eye on the runoff that will determine the Democratic nominee for secretary of state in Georgia. State Rep. Bee Nguyen is the front-runner for the nomination \u2013 having captured roughly 44% of the primary vote last month, but still short of the majority required to win outright under Georgia law. She faces former state Rep. Dee Dawkins-Haigler, who took nearly 19% of the vote. Nguyen, a rising star in Democratic circles, has scored endorsements from a slew of national and state politicians, including Stacey Abrams, Georgia\u2019s Democratic nominee for governor. The daughter of Vietnamese refugees, Nguyen would become the first Asian American elected to a statewide political post in Georgia, should she prevail in the primary and in the fall. In November, the Democratic winner will face the Republican incumbent Brad Raffensperger, who famously refused Trump\u2019s request to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn his 2020 loss in Georgia. On Tuesday afternoon, Raffensperger and his deputy Gabe Sterling are slated to testify before the House January 6 committee. Also scheduled to speak: Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, another Republican who resisted Trump\u2019s post-election pressure campaign to overturn the results in his home state. We\u2019ve written about Bowers and the ways he has handled some of his party\u2019s most outrageous election proposals in an earlier newsletter edition. (For the record, we at CNN \u2013 and other news organizations \u2013 covered Trump\u2019s fundraising bait-and-switch here and here and elsewhere as it was happening. A bit of advice: Always read the fine print on fundraising solicitations before giving any money to any politician.)",

Once-sleepy secretary of state contests are taking on new urgency in the aftermath of efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election outcome. Twenty-seven states will pick election chiefs in this year\u2019s midterm elections, and some of the biggest races will develop in four of the six states where Trump\u2019s allies sought to challenge his loss to President Joe Biden: Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan. Trump has endorsed candidates in all but one of those states, Nevada. We\u2019re using this edition of the newsletter to highlight five key races to watch this primary season, starting today. Voting ends today in the contests that decide who will advance to the November ballot in one of country\u2019s most closely watched battles for secretary of state. The GOP primary pits the current officeholder Brad Raffensperger against three opponents. His most prominent rival: Rep. Jody Hice, a four-term congressman endorsed by Trump. Raffensperger, who is seeking a second term as Georgia\u2019s election chief, rebuffed Trump\u2019s demand to \u201cfind\u201d the votes the then-President needed to overcome Biden\u2019s nearly 12,000-vote victory in Georgia in 2020. That call now is part of a special grand jury investigation into whether Trump or his allies committed any crimes in their quest to overturn the election results. And while Raffensperger has defended the 2020 election process, he also has embraced a controversial law enacted last year in Georgia that imposed an array of new voting restrictions, including requiring identification to vote absentee. And, as he works to burnish his conservative credentials, he has pushed for a constitutional amendment to ban noncitizen voting, although it\u2019s already illegal under Georgia law. Hice, meanwhile, was one of 147 GOP members of Congress who objected to certifying Biden\u2019s victory on January 6, 2021, and he has centered his campaign on false claims about the 2020 election. (For the record, three recounts in the state confirmed Biden\u2019s win. And just last week, the Georgia State Election Board voted to toss out complaints alleging illegal ballot collection in that election.) Among Democrats, state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who helped lead the charge against voting restrictions passed by the GOP-controlled Georgia legislature, is the best-known candidate outside the state in a five-person race for her party\u2019s nomination and has scored a slew of prominent endorsements in her bid. Her methodical takedown of voter fraud claims advanced by a Trump ally during a December 2020 legislative hearing went viral, immediately boosting her national profile. Other Democratic contenders include former Cobb County Democratic Party Chairman Michael Owens, former state Rep. Dee Dawkins-Haigler and John Eaves, a former chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, which oversees government functions in the state\u2019s most populous county. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters will compete in a June 21 runoff election. Nevada\u2019s current Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, is term-limited, leaving an open seat. She defended the integrity of the 2020 election in the Silver State following Biden\u2019s win and was censured by members of her own party. Cisco Aguilar, a Las Vegas attorney who worked for late US Sen. Harry Reid, is already the choice of Democrats. Among the Republican contenders, Jim Marchant, a former state assemblyman and unsuccessful candidate for the US House of Representatives, is arguably the best-known. He has said he would not have certified Biden\u2019s win \u2013 although Trump lost the state by more than 33,000 votes. And Marchant has pushed to eliminate voting machines, early voting and mail-in voting. Other candidates on the Republican ticket include Kristopher Dahir, a Sparks city council member; Jesse Haw, a former state lawmaker and real estate developer; former Las Vegas TV anchor Gerard Ramalho and former District Court Judge Richard Scotti. Nevada\u2019s primary is June 14. Democratic Secretary of State Jena Griswold is seeking a second term as Colorado\u2019s top election official in a state viewed as reliably blue. Biden won Colorado by double digits in 2020. But the Republican nomination battle has seized the spotlight. Tina Peters, the Mesa County clerk indicted by a county grand jury earlier this year as part of an local investigation into a security breach of voting systems, is running to face Griswold this fall. And many of her fellow Republicans have brushed past Peters\u2019 legal woes; she received some 60% of the vote at a recent gathering of Colorado Republicans, making her a front-runner for the GOP nod. Peters has denied the charges, saying the investigation is partisan and politically motivated. A county judge, however, has barred Peters from overseeing either the June primaries or the November general election in the county \u2013 even as she seeks run elections statewide. Colorado Republicans will officially pick their nominee in late June. Peters faces two other GOP contenders: former Jefferson County clerk Pam Anderson, who served as executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association and Mike O\u2019Donnell, who founded a nonprofit small-business lending firm. The primary is June 28. Arizona, a state that Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes, has become a hotbed of fringe conspiracy theories about election fraud. Exhibit A: The widely discredited Cyber Ninjas review of election results in Maricopa County, commissioned by the Republican-led Arizona Senate. The conspiracies dominate the fight over who will oversee elections in this battleground state during the 2024 presidential race. State GOP Rep. Mark Finchem, who earned an early endorsement from the former President in his bid for secretary of state, has called for the decertification of the 2020 presidential results. He recently filed a lawsuit with another Trump-endorsed candidate, gubernatorial hopeful Kari Lake, seeking to ban the use of any machines to cast or count votes in this year\u2019s elections. Other GOP contenders: Advertising executive Edward \u201cBeau\u201d Lane, state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita and state Rep. Shawnna Bolick. State Rep. Reginald Bolding, the minority leader of the Arizona House of Representatives, and Adrian Fontes, the former head election official in Maricopa County, are vying for the Democratic nomination. Current Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor this year. Not only does the secretary of state set the ground rules for elections, the officeholder is first in line to succeed the state\u2019s governor in the event of illness, death or removal from office. Arizona does not have a lieutenant governor. That primary is August 2. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, is looking to win another four-year term. Benson rose to national prominence amid the 2020 election fallout \u2013 as she defended the election process and results, in the face of efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the state. At one point, she said, armed protesters showed up outside her home to demand she reverse the outcome. This fall, Benson is expected to face Kristina Karamo, a political newcomer and community college professor who was endorsed at the Michigan GOP state convention earlier this year. Karamo\u2019s nomination is expected to be reaffirmed at an official party vote in August. Karamo, who has won Trump\u2019s endorsement, gained attention after the 2020 election when she alleged witnessing fraud as a poll challenger during the counting of absentee ballots. She also signed on to an unsuccessful US Supreme Court challenge to Biden\u2019s win. Two hundred and fifty post-election audits by Michigan\u2019s secretary of state confirmed the accuracy of the 2020 election and that Biden won the state by more than 150,000 votes. In addition, a GOP-led state Senate investigation found no evidence of widespread fraud in the election.",

            "article_content": "The two dozen volunteers who gathered outdoors on a humid Saturday morning had a very specific assignment: Fan out through the surrounding neighborhood in the hopes of persuading Democrats to show up in Tuesday\u2019s primary election and vote for secretary of state candidate Bee Nguyen. But Nguyen, a state lawmaker who has helped lead the fight against Republican efforts to restrict voting in this presidential battleground, framed the mission in stark terms. \u201cThis race is about defending the freedom to vote,\u201d Nguyen said, standing before a picnic table covered in glossy campaign flyers. \u201cIt is about protecting the future of our democracy.\u201d The battle to become Georgia\u2019s next secretary of state and preside over the 2024 presidential election here has emerged as one of the most hotly contested fights for election chiefs this year. The job has taken on new weight after repeated attempts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 loss in the state. In the aftermath of that election, the Republican-controlled legislature passed sweeping changes to voting rules \u2013 actions that critics say are aimed at dampening the record turnout from 2020 that helped President Joe Biden become the first Democratic presidential contender in nearly 30 years to win the Peach State. Republicans are facing a contentious primary of their own on Tuesday, with the incumbent, Brad Raffensperger, who famously rebuffed Trump\u2019s request to \u201cfind\u201d votes, facing several challengers including Rep. Jody Hice. Hice, one of the 147 House Republicans who voted against certifying Biden\u2019s win on January 6, 2021, won Trump\u2019s backing in the race as the former President seeks to exact revenge on Raffensperger and other Republicans he views as disloyal. For Nguyen to take on the eventual Republican nominee in the fall, she will first have to win Tuesday night. If she does capture the Democratic nomination and then prevails against the GOP candidate, she would become the first Asian American elected to a statewide political post in Georgia. And that win might signal that the fast-changing demographics that helped propel Biden to victory here nearly two years ago had become a durable path to power for Democrats in this Deep South state. \u201cWe\u2019re battling for the soul of the nation right here in Georgia,\u201d said veteran Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia, and the whip of the Congressional Black Caucus. He\u2019s endorsed the 40-year-old Nguyen, bypassing four other Democratic contenders. \u201cShe is our future,\u201d he said. Nguyen, the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, has risen swiftly in the state\u2019s Democratic politics. The founder of an youth-focused nonprofit was first elected in late 2017 to fill the Atlanta-area state House seat then held by Stacey Abrams, who was seeking the governorship at the time. Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor, is making her second consecutive bid for the office this year. Nguyen\u2019s victory in a runoff made her the first Asian American woman in the Georgia General Assembly. But Nguyen (pronounced \u201cwin\u201d) vaulted to national prominence in December 2020 when a video of her methodical and public takedown of election fraud claims by Trump allies went viral. Nguyen had spent time before a legislative hearing holed up in her office, examining the lists of voters who the Trump campaign alleged may have committed election fraud in Georgia. In one case, she drove to see a constituent who the campaign claimed had voted in both Georgia and Virginia. The voter and her husband have \u201clived in Georgia their entire lives\u201d and \u201chave lived in that same house since 1985,\u201d Nguyen said during the Q&A with an analyst whose research had been cited in lawsuits brought by Trump and his allies. \u201cThey\u2019ve never even been to the state in which they are alleged to have double-voted.\u201d Since announcing her bid last year, Nguyen has racked up national endorsements, including the support of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State and EMILY\u2019s List, the influential Democratic political committee that backs female abortion-rights candidates. This month, EMILY\u2019s List gave her the Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award, named for the former Arizona Democratic congresswoman and gun-safety advocate. Previous honorees include Abrams. And just days before the primary, Atlanta\u2019s Mayor Andre Dickens, who scored an upset in last year\u2019s elections, added his backing. Four other Democrats are on Tuesday\u2019s ballot: John Eaves, a former chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners; former Cobb County, Georgia, Democratic Party Chairman Michael Owens; former state Rep. Dee Dawkins-Haigler; and former state Sen. Floyd Griffin. Georgia\u2019s election rules require candidates to win more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff. So, in the final sprint to the primary, Nguyen darted around the metro Atlanta area, seeking last-minute face time with voters. Further complicating matters for down-ballot Democratic candidates like Nguyen, the early data suggest that thousands of Democrats who have voted early crossed party lines to vote in high-profile Republican primaries. So, Nguyen\u2019s supporters are trying to urge reliable Democrats to show up on Tuesday, grab Democratic ballots and back her. On Friday, she played bingo at a senior citizen center. On Saturday morning, she met with canvassing teams, before slipping out to attend a family christening \u2013 where she says she badgered guests about their voting plans for Tuesday. Saturday evening, she and her team made a pitch for votes and campaign money at a backyard party attended by a clutch of business owners, other Democratic politicians and some of her staff and volunteers. In an interview with CNN, she talked wistfully about the half-marathons she no longer has time to run. Her skateboard, a pandemic gift from her partner and fellow Democratic state representative David Dreyer, sits unused in the trunk of her car these days. (The couple met while door-knocking several years ago for Democratic Rep. Sam Park, the first Asian American Democrat elected to the Georgia General Assembly. Nguyen would become Park\u2019s campaign manager and his legislative chief of staff before running for office herself.) Her rivals for the nomination have bristled at the national attention showered on Nguyen. \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate \u2013 especially compared to Bee Nguyen \u2013 who has direct experience with elections,\u201d said Eaves, 60, who served 11 years on the Fulton County commission. Fulton County, which includes swaths of Atlanta, is the state\u2019s most populous. And Nguyen\u2019s supporters, he said, are misreading Georgia\u2019s Democratic electorate, which remains heavily African American and that he needs in his bid to become the first Black person elected secretary of state in Georgia. In the interview, Nguyen said she has defied expectations ever since she began running for office. \u201cI was told, \u2018You\u2019re not the right candidate. Wait your turn,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBut no one said, \u2018You\u2019re not smart enough. You\u2019re not committed enough or you\u2019re not going to do a good job for the people in your district.\u2019 \u201c Her team hopes that the relentless campaigning by Nguyen and her volunteers, along with her fundraising, will deliver an outright victory Tuesday. Her donations have topped $1.2 million for this once low-profile seat, records show \u2013 giving her the budget to pay for television ads to introduce herself to Democratic voters. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her face on TV,\u201d said Dexter Green, a 71-year-old retiree, as he listened to music at a festival in Hapeville, Georgia, on Saturday afternoon. He said he had cast his ballot during Georgia\u2019s early voting window and had voted for Nguyen. \u201cShe seems like she might be OK,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to give her a chance.\u201d Several yards away, Nguyen\u2019s campaign manager Maria Banjo handed Nguyen\u2019s flyer to an African American woman, who chatted politely with Banjo about having a Vietnamese student with the same surname. But after Banjo walked away, the woman told a reporter that \u201cif there\u2019s another Black person running, I\u2019m voting for them.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t see enough of us in these positions,\u201d she added, declining to provide her name. In a sign of Georgia\u2019s emergence as a political battleground and Nguyen\u2019s national profile, volunteers from as far away as Washington state joined the campaign\u2019s final get-out-the-vote push over the weekend \u2013 brought together by Common Power, an organization that helps blue state progressives volunteer in swing states. Diane Douglas, a nonprofit and foundation consultant in the Seattle area, was among the out-of-state volunteers. She had taken a red-eye flight that landed in Atlanta at 7 a.m. Saturday, and by early that afternoon, she was knocking on doors. Georgia\u2019s swing to Biden \u2013 and to Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the 2020 election \u2013 has made the state central to Democrats\u2019 future hopes, Douglas said. And hitting the streets to help Georgia Democrats like Nguyen, she said, is \u201cmy duty as a citizen.\u201d As Nguyen stumps in Georgia, she touches frequently on how her family\u2019s refugee experience shapes her views. Following the fall of Saigon in 1975, Nguyen said her father \u2013 a pharmacist and lieutenant who served in a medical role in the South Vietnamese army aligned with Americans \u2013 was imprisoned for three years in a reeducation camp. Once he was released, the family fled \u2013 a harrowing journey that included a rescue at sea by a Thai fisherman. The family resettled in Iowa in the late 1970s, where Nguyen was born in 1981. They moved to Augusta, Georgia, when she was young. Nguyen said her parents are not particularly political, encouraging their children to \u201ckeep their heads down,\u201d study hard and build professional lives. But Nguyen said she and her four sisters also were taught not to take their civil liberties for granted. \u201cMy parents would say, \u2018We never ever thought we would lose our country, but the signs were there. The writing was on the wall.\u2019 \u201c \u201cI draw a comparison to what we are seeing as it pertains to the fragility of our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cRepublicans have told us they don\u2019t believe in the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\u201d In speeches, she warns that the US is just \u201cone to two cycles away from a constitutional crisis\u201d \u2013 that moment when some election official chooses to bypass the will of voters. Nguyen and other critics of Georgia\u2019s sweeping 2021 election law, known as SB 202, saying it lays the groundwork for election subversion. Among other things, the law grants the state\u2019s election board the power to order performance reviews of county\u2019s elections operations and appoint a temporary administrator. The board already has done so for heavily Democratic Fulton County at the request of several Republican legislators. During a recent televised debate, Nguyen and the other Democratic candidates running for secretary of state said they do not support defending SB 202 in court. Multiple pending lawsuits challenge the law \u2013 including one filed by the US Justice Department and another brought by Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, which is run by her younger sister, Phi Nguyen. (Nguyen said her sister recently told her: \u201d \u2018I hope you know that if you are secretary of state, I\u2019m still going to sue you.\u2019 \u201c) In addition to guarding against attempts to subvert the election in 2024, Nguyen said helping voters more easily navigate Georgia\u2019s election laws would be a top priority. That includes using text messages and other means to repeatedly alert voters to changes in their polling places and establishing \u201csecure kiosks\u201d where Georgians could submit absentee ballots applications and scan the forms of ID now required to vote by mail under the new law. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, used his post as state elections chief to move up the ladder to higher office. But Nguyen quickly demurs when asked about her future ambitions. \u201cOh gosh,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get past Tuesday.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is making increasingly urgent calls for the democratic world to rush arms to \u201csave Ukraine\u201d as Russia prepares to unleash a concentrated assault in the east that threatens new carnage for civilians. Zelensky\u2019s latest appeal, which has Western leaders grappling with how far they are willing to test President Vladimir Putin\u2019s red lines, came as he warned that there were \u201ctens of thousands of dead\u201d in the southern port city of Mariupol which has endured weeks of bombardment. \u201cUkraine needs support for its military, including planes and tanks,\u201d Zelensky said in a virtual address to the South Korean parliament on Monday. \u201cSouth Korea has various defense systems that could defend against Russian tanks, ships, and missiles,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cIf Ukraine can have these weapons, they will not only save the lives of ordinary people, but they\u2019ll save Ukraine,\u201d he said. Heroic resistance from Ukrainian troops, with the help of Western anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, has already claimed a famous victory \u2013 the saving of Kyiv and Zelensky\u2019s government. But now, Russia has named a new general to lead what has been a chaotic war effort and is grouping its forces in eastern Ukraine for a fearsome, concentrated assault that could stretch Ukraine\u2019s outnumbered forces as never before. The shift of strategy is forcing Western leaders to consider their own willingness to provide more offensive armaments to Kyiv ahead of what is shaping up to be a vicious battle that could dictate how much of Ukraine survives as a nation-state. Pressure on the West to do more is being exacerbated by the fact that Russia\u2019s new approach augurs yet more carnage for the civilians that it has been deliberately targeting with a vicious war plan. As Washington evaluates how to respond to Russia\u2019s latest maneuvers, there were sighs of relief in the US capital as French President Emmanuel Macron prevailed in the first round of the presidential election. But the survival in office of a key member of the Western leadership coalition will only be assured if he can beat the runner-up, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen \u2013 a longtime Putin sympathizer \u2013 in the tight campaign that will play out ahead of the second round in two weeks. New questions for the West about how best to bolster Ukraine\u2019s resistance follow a skittishness in Washington earlier in the war about antagonizing Putin with, for example, the transfer of Soviet-era jets from NATO states like Poland to Ukraine. More recently, the US has signaled it is willing to help its partners to get Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine. And Britain promised a robust package of arms following Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s dramatic visit to Kyiv on Saturday. Decisions on exactly what kind of weapons to provide could depend on the end game the West sees in the country, especially after Zelensky\u2019s increasingly caustic appeals for more offensive weaponry following the discovery of atrocities against Ukrainian civilians when Russian forces pulled back from Kyiv. President Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser Jake Sullivan gave the impression on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that Washington\u2019s policy would follow Kyiv\u2019s lead. But he also implied that broader US assistance and unprecedented sanctions on Russia\u2019s economy were also designed to better position Ukraine for any future ceasefire talks \u2013 despite the failure of such efforts so far, given that there is little sign Putin is serious about a de-escalation. \u201cThis is not a story of anyone standing by,\u201d Sullivan told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cWe are taking aggressive action in an effort to both help the Ukrainians succeed on the battlefield and help the Ukrainians have the best possible position at the negotiating table.\u201d But Republican Rep. Liz Cheney gave voice to a faction in Washington that says the US should be doing far more, though the Wyoming congresswoman is not advocating the dispatch of US troops to Ukraine. Western leaders have been concerned about igniting direct conflict with Russia amid fears of a nuclear escalation. \u201cWe should not be talking about, as Jake Sullivan did just now, improving Zelensky\u2019s position at the negotiating table,\u201d Cheney said, also on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThis is about defeating Russian forces in Ukraine. It\u2019s about much more than Ukraine,\u201d Cheney said, calling for shipments of tanks, artillery and armored equipment to be sent to the country. \u201cWe need to be doing much more, more quickly.\u201d CNN reported over the weekend that Putin has, for the first time, put a single military officer in charge of the Ukraine invasion, which has so far been plagued by poor strategy, supply issues, indiscipline and low morale among the troops. The appointment of Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, the commander of Russia\u2019s Southern Military District, has raised alarm in Washington. White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that Dvornikov was responsible for \u201catrocities we saw in Syria\u201d and pledged that the US will continue to work to ensure Ukraine has the weapons it needs. Washington has been walking a line between providing Ukraine with hardware that would allow it to repel the Russian invasion and inflict a heavy cost on Putin\u2019s troops and being seen to take steps that would turn the war into a direct clash between the United States and Russia, which could cause a dangerous escalation. But there are clear signs now that the West is reevaluating where those red lines are as the war enters a new stage. The process comes as the world reels with revulsion from atrocities against civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha and from an attack on a train station in the eastern city of in Kramatorsk that refugees were using to flee the fighting in eastern Ukraine. Cheney said on CNN that the attack \u201cclearly is genocide.\u201d US and Western officials have stopped short of using that designation, citing the need for a legal process on a term that is typically used with specificity, but have frequently accused Putin and his troops of committing war crimes. Both Psaki and Sullivan mentioned a two-hour call that took place between senior US military and administration appointees with top Ukrainian officials last week. During that call, the Ukrainians went down a list, item by item, of hardware and armaments that they\u2019ve requested. Psaki said that the administration was working to ensure that if the US couldn\u2019t provide the requested material, its allies could. Johnson, for instance, laid out a package of equipment that the UK was willing to provide, including 120 armored vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems. It was not clear what limits that Washington might place on the criteria of weaponry that might be available to the Ukrainians.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is doing it again \u2013 putting his personal goals and burning zeal for revenge above the national interest \u2013 as he once more appeals for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s political help in the midst of the brutality in Ukraine. Trump\u2019s call on the Kremlin strongman to dig up dirt on President Joe Biden is no surprise. He\u2019s called on Russia and China before to interfere in US elections to boost his chances and got impeached for trying to blackmail Ukraine to do the same. But this may be the ex-President\u2019s most twisted and pathological attempt yet to corruptly advance his own political career ahead of a possible 2024 White House bid. His thinking seems to be clear. Putin might be raining atrocities on Ukrainian citizens, bombing hospitals, apartment blocks, razing entire cities and sending 4 million refugees west into Europe. But Trump seems willing to overlook all of that in service of his own perceived interests. The Hunter Biden soap opera is far from over Not only is Trump seeking to cook up a self-serving conspiracy with a Russian President much of the world now regards as a war criminal. He\u2019s also asking an enemy of the United States, who has threatened nuclear war, to damage the American commander-in-chief who is leading the West in an effort to aid an innocent, invaded nation and to save democracy. Trump\u2019s latest appeal offers a window into his twisted morality as he lines up again alongside Putin, whom he called a \u201cgenius\u201d earlier in the Ukraine crisis even as much of his own party condemned the invasion. And it raises fundamental questions about the patriotism of an ex-President who sometimes hugs the stars and stripes at his rallies but who often showed while in office that he cared only for his own interests. Trump issued his public appeal to Putin in an interview with sympathetic conservative news network Just the News. He pushed an unproven claim about Hunter Biden\u2019s potential business dealings in Russia, and asked Putin to release any information that he might have about the situation. \u201cI would think Putin would know the answer to that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think he should release it. I think we should know that answer.\u201d It\u2019s not clear that any material exists, or if the Kremlin has access to it. A Justice Department investigation into the President\u2019s son is gathering steam, CNN reported Wednesday citing multiple sources. Investigators have examined whether Hunter Biden and some of his associates violated money laundering, tax and foreign lobbying laws, as well as firearm and other regulations, multiple sources said. But Hunter Biden has not been charged with any crimes and has denied any wrongdoing. His father is not being investigated as part of the probe of his son\u2019s business activities, according to sources who have been briefed. Some will argue that Trump\u2019s latest outrageous comments should be ignored, to deprive him of the political oxygen that he craves. Republicans will no doubt accuse Trump critics of taking his words too literally. But the words of an ex-President, especially at a time of war, carry weight. Trump remains the effective leader of the Republican Party. He\u2019s a hot favorite for the GOP nomination in 2024, won nearly 47% of the popular vote in 2020 and could have a reasonable chance in a presidential rematch against Biden. Therefore the ex-President has enormous political power, and his behavior and rhetoric must be examined by voters as they consider whether to return him to the Oval Office. There is every reason, especially in the light of his latest comments, to suppose a second Trump term would turn into an even greater quest for personal power and enrichment than the first. After all, he was willing to destroy American democracy by inciting an insurrection against a free and fair election to stay in power. The ex-President is also playing a huge role in November\u2019s midterm elections, endorsing candidates who back his democracy-threatening claims of electoral fraud. Trump\u2019s latest appeal to Putin also offers another possible preview of the future. It shows he still thinks he can gain political advantage by siding with the Russian leader, who was assessed by US intelligence to have meddled in the 2016 election in a bid to help him win. There\u2019s no sense that the Russian leader\u2019s brutality makes him radioactive to Trump. This episode is also a reminder that while much of the world has been transfixed by Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s fight for his country, Trump chose to try to extort the Ukrainian President over the kind of military aid Ukraine is now using to fend off the Russian offensive. Trump had hoped to force Zelensky to announce a probe into the Bidens before the 2020 election. Trump\u2019s newest comments will also fuel concerns of European leaders standing alongside the US in supporting Ukraine that a return to office by the former President could buckle NATO. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah expressed exactly those fears in an interview Tuesday on CNN+ with Kasie Hunt. When Trump was impeached for a second time, for inciting a coup attempt based on his lies about a stolen election, most Senate Republicans backed off convicting him. Their reasoning was that as an ex-President, stripped of power, Trump could do no more harm. His latest appeal to Putin exposes the cowardice of that decision. It also suggests Trump has realized that there is no cost to be paid for calling on America\u2019s most sworn enemies to help his own political career. His bet on impunity is so brazen that as usual, he\u2019s performing the corruption out loud. Why you can't just ignore this statement from Donald Trump One interesting question is whether Trump is making a political error in seeking assistance from Putin despite his recent atrocities. Only 6% of Republicans in a February Quinnipiac University poll had a favorable impression of the Russian leader. Since the invasion, Trump has struggled to balance his fixation with Putin with the outrage of Americans about Ukraine\u2019s fate. He has taken to insisting that Putin would never have dared to invade had he still been President, despite his long record of advancing Russia\u2019s foreign policy goals while he was in the White House. House Republicans, who lost the last two elections because of Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the suburbs, will hardly welcome the ex-President\u2019s pro-Putin slant as the midterms approach, though Democrats found out in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race last year that running an anti-Trump campaign at a time of high gas prices and inflation didn\u2019t work. One of the ironies of Trump\u2019s latest attempt to enlist Putin\u2019s help was that it would have been easy for him to take a swipe over his successor over Hunter Biden without invoking a Russian leader he has always hero-worshipped. As usual, Trump\u2019s call out to Putin led to uncomfortable moments for Republican senators when confronted by journalists on Capitol Hill this week. And as is often the case, some of their reactions suggested that much of the party would follow him yet again in order to secure power, or at least would not actively thwart his dangerous impulses. North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer seemed to endorse Trump\u2019s suggestion for Putin to publicize any information he has that might be damaging to the current President. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he has dirt on Biden. If he does, he should reveal it, but he is a war criminal so I don\u2019t expect that he\u2019s right now sitting around thinking about ways that he can reveal other information,\u201d Cramer told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has called for Russians to assassinate Putin, was also offered the chance to condemn Trump for seeking to conspire with a US enemy. 'He's an embarrassment': Republicans threaten to primary Cawthorn over controversial antics \u201cMy message to Putin is he needs to go,\u201d Graham told Raju. Asked about Trump\u2019s comments, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I would do.\u201d Senate Republican Whip John Thune, against whom Trump unsuccessfully encouraged the South Dakota governor to run in a primary, bemoaned the fact that \u201cwe have very little control over what the former President says.\u201d But the question that will face Republicans in the event of a likely Trump presidential run is whether the things that he says and does will make him an unacceptable choice to become the GOP nominee again. On past form, the answer will be a clear no. On the other side of Capitol Hill, Republicans were in the mood for doling out accountability. But not to Trump. GOP leaders were fuming at Rep. Madison Cawthorn, the North Carolina Republican who had embarrassed his colleagues by bizarrely claiming he was invited to an orgy and saw leaders in the effort to curb drug addiction using cocaine. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. I told him he\u2019s lost my trust,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. \u201cHe did not tell the truth, that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d But the California Republican has rarely defended truth as a standard of public life while dealing with Trump. As he seeks to become the next speaker in a House GOP conference that is the ex-President\u2019s most potent Washington power base, McCarthy has sought to whitewash Trump\u2019s conduct during the Capitol insurrection, even though he said at the time the ex-President \u201cbears responsibility\u201d for the riot. And while he came down hard on Cawthorn, McCarthy has also been reluctant to discipline other pro-Trump members of the party like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona, whose recent attendance at a White supremacist conference adds to their long list of extremist outbursts. And he\u2019s backing a primary challenge to Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost her leadership position in the House GOP for telling the truth about Trump\u2019s lies about a stolen election and threats to democratic institutions. Cheney\u2019s plight shows why Trump will continue to pay no price for courting favors from America\u2019s enemies \u2013 even from Putin.",

            "article_content": "Just nine unscripted words put an already jittery world on edge again. President Joe Biden\u2019s suggestion in Poland on Saturday that Vladimir Putin\u2019s onslaught on Ukraine should disqualify him from power triggered an international political storm. Back in Washington Sunday evening, Biden told reporters that he was not calling for regime change in Russia \u2013 echoing a message spelled out multiple times by his subordinates even before he had returned to the US. Biden's off-the-cuff remark on Putin sends shock waves on dramatic final day of trip But the global reverberations from the remarks leave the administration facing grave questions. Some are strategic and could impact the future course of the war and so-far elusive hopes for a ceasefire. Others are political and relate to Biden\u2019s standing at home, amid a torrent of Republican criticism, and internationally, as he seeks to keep the Western coalition together. They include: It was clear from the speed with which administration officials worked to clarify Biden\u2019s remark that they knew it could be a big problem that could potentially make an already fraught European geopolitical showdown much worse. In a jab not in his scripted remarks, Biden said, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power\u201d in a reference to Putin. A White House official said Biden meant that \u201cPutin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region\u201d and said Biden wasn\u2019t referring to regime change. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was even more categorical during a trip to Jerusalem on Sunday. 8 takeaways from Biden's trip to Europe \u201cWe do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia, or anywhere else for that matter,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cIn this case, as it is in any case, it\u2019s up to the people of the country in question. It is up to the Russian people.\u201d The clean-up language was hardly convincing given the clear context of the original quote. But a remark with such implications in a time of high tensions clearly needed walking back. And quickly. Any idea that the US saw the conflict as an attempt to unseat Putin would be dangerous since it would elevate the clash to a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia. Biden has scrupulously tried to avoid that scenario \u2013 notably blocking a Polish plan to send Soviet-made fighter jets to Ukraine to avoid the impression that NATO is taking a more direct role in the war. The situation is already on a knife-edge since huge Western shipments of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles are fueling Ukraine\u2019s strong resistance and apparently causing heavy Russian casualties. There\u2019s no doubt that Biden handed Putin a propaganda gift that could undermine the US President\u2019s own hard work in keeping the focus on Ukraine. Moscow\u2019s information complex is certain to present the war to the Russian people as a hostile push by the West in order to further obscure the truth about the unprovoked attack on Ukraine. This could ease the political pressure the West hopes will be built by harsh sanctions designed to change Putin\u2019s calculation. But Biden\u2019s initial efforts to avoid personalizing the conflict with Putin and characterizing the war as a direct US-Russia showdown have been undermined by his own hardening rhetoric toward the Russian leader in recent days. He made it known earlier this month that he believes that Putin is a war criminal after relentless attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians that triggered a massive refugee exodus. Bash presses NATO rep. on walking back Biden's unscripted Putin declaration Biden\u2019s comment about the Russian leader\u2019s tenure on power was not the only striking rhetoric of his tour. After meeting refugees on Saturday, Biden called Putin a \u201cbutcher.\u201d Previously, Biden had called him a \u201cthug\u201d and a \u201cmurderous dictator.\u201d And the script from which he departed to make the now notorious remark was in itself hawkish, previewing what Biden said was a long struggle, which sounded a lot like a new Cold War. Given that Biden is likely feeling the burden of world peace on his shoulders and acute empathy for those visited by unspeakable tragedy in Ukraine, his outbursts on his European trip may be understandable as a human reaction to great suffering. \u201cHe went to the National Stadium in Warsaw and literally met with hundreds of Ukrainians,\u201d US ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cIn the moment, I think that was a principled human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day,\u201d Smith said, underscoring again that the US didn\u2019t have a policy of regime change in Russia. But a President\u2019s words must also be carefully chosen. As Saturday\u2019s drama showed, it takes just a moment to cause a dangerous diplomatic crisis. Biden was largely successful in reversing his propensity for gaffes during his 2020 election bid, during a campaign robbed of spontaneous moments by the Covid-19 pandemic. It was unfortunate that his old habits of speaking his mind at inopportune moments resurfaced now. Republicans seized on the President\u2019s frank comments on Sunday, seeking to dent an impression that Biden has responded well to Putin\u2019s provocations so far in the Ukraine crisis. Clearly, they didn\u2019t just have national security in mind but also politics ahead of the midterm elections, which are being shaped by the President\u2019s diminished approval ratings. And in some of the criticism there was a sense Republicans were playing into the conservative media trope that Biden is old, is not in full control and could blunder the US into a war. Such a position conveniently forgets the tolerance of right-wing opinion hosts towards ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s volcanic rhetoric, but it has power in the GOP grassroots. Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Idaho Sen Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, appeared both to be underlining the administration\u2019s message about being opposed to regime change in Moscow while also finding a way to hammer Biden\u2019s capacity to lead. The 2022 campaign story was set. Then Russia invaded Ukraine. While praising Biden\u2019s speech in Poland, the Idaho Republican said, \u201cThere was a horrendous gaffe right at the end of it. I just wish he would stay on script.\u201d \u201cThis administration has done everything they can to stop escalating,\u201d Risch said. But he added: \u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot more you can do to escalate than to call for regime change.\u201d Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman was slightly more temperate but no less critical. \u201cFirst, I think all of us believe the world would be a better place without Vladimir Putin. But second, that\u2019s not the official US policy. And by saying that, that regime change is our strategy, effectively, it plays into the hands of the Russian propagandists and plays into the hands of Vladimir Putin,\u201d Portman said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments sent shockwaves through Europe as well as Washington. And they appeared to irritate French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been a key figure in trying, with little success, to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use terms like that because I\u2019m still in talks with President Putin,\u201d Macron told the France 3 television channel, when asked about Biden\u2019s comment that the Russian leader was a \u201cbutcher.\u201d Any future ceasefire deal Putin agrees to is unlikely to emerge from US diplomacy given the deep and mutual hostility between Moscow and Washington. But any final agreement \u2013 and indeed the long-term goal of preventing dangerous escalations between the world\u2019s top two nuclear powers \u2013 depends on them talking to one another. It was already hard to see how Biden could meet a Russian leader whom he has branded a war criminal. This weekend\u2019s events made that even more difficult. And while the US goal in Moscow is not regime change, it\u2019s hard to see any meaningful dialogue while Putin is still in charge.",

            "article_content": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine opened up a new front in the 2022 US midterm cycle, with America\u2019s role in the conflict taking a place alongside the culture war clashes, economic worries and fights over pandemic policy that had driven the early stages of the election. The global implications of the war in Europe has forced candidates in both parties to adjust their political playbooks to account for a rapidly evolving new issue that, at its core, has united voters in support of aiding the Ukrainian resistance to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression, but also underscored the rigid partisan divide that defines modern American politics. For Democratic candidates who are likely to sink or swim on public perception of President Joe Biden\u2019s job performance, Russia\u2019s war on a fledgling democracy on its doorstep has presented a new opportunity to derail a despairing narrative that many believe ends with Democrats losing both chambers of Congress. It could also potentially advance Biden\u2019s climate agenda and revive his poll numbers. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Elected Republican officials and candidates, meanwhile, have at once signaled their support for the harsh sanctions imposed on Russia by the Biden administration while criticizing the President for not acting aggressively enough \u2013 all the while continuing to hammer Democrats over domestic economic difficulties. Biden, in remarks earlier this month, sought to put the onus for rising gas prices on the Russian leader. \u201cMake no mistake: The current spike in gas prices is largely the fault of Vladimir Putin. It has nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan,\u201d Biden said, seeking in the moment to divorce his signature Covid-19 relief spending bill from rapidly increasing energy costs. On the campaign trail, Republicans are quick to point out that gas prices were on the upswing before the war began more than four weeks ago \u2013 and are eager to pin the blame fully on Biden. Rebecca Kleefisch, the Republican former lieutenant governor of Wisconsin who is challenging Democratic Gov. Tony Evers this year, said the war in Ukraine and the resulting rise in gas prices only amplified the economic concerns that she is asked about constantly on the campaign trail. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even say that I\u2019m wrapping these issues into current events,\u201d Kleefisch said. \u201cAffordability is one of the key issues that people think about and talk about with me every single day. You have to remember that gas prices began rising significantly before the war in Ukraine even began.\u201d The Wisconsin race is one of a handful of governor\u2019s races in battleground states in which Republicans are seizing on any and all Democratic environmental policy-related decisions to make the case that those Democrats bear at least some responsibility for rising gas prices. In next-door Michigan, Republicans who control the legislature have pushed Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to implement a state gas tax holiday that would temporarily save residents about 27 cents per gallon. Kleefisch said she hasn\u2019t called for a similar step in Wisconsin because it would amount to \u201ca temporary fix for long-term policy decisions\u201d \u2013 but was ready to rattle off a series of those policy decisions for which she said Evers is to blame. She accused Evers of \u201cwoke environmentalism\u201d \u2013 arguing that he should have fought against Whitmer\u2019s push to shut down an aging Great Lakes oil pipeline and criticizing a failed Evers proposal to tie the state\u2019s gas tax rate to inflation. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, one of the Democratic Party\u2019s leading foreign policy voices, said he believed Biden\u2019s actions to date \u2013 most notably his role in helping to coalesce Europe against Putin \u2013 has vindicated the President\u2019s 2020 campaign pledge to deftly manage international crises. The challenge going forward, for Biden and Democrats, will be in clearly and consistently communicating to voters the connection between the deadly disruption in Europe and economic pain on the home front, Murphy told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s important for the President to continue to explain that gas prices are going to remain high so long as this conflict continues. And that ultimately other costs, like food costs, are going to be in the crosshairs. We\u2019re not used to having to sacrifice for modern warfare,\u201d Murphy said, noting that former President George W. Bush cut taxes in the midst of US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Murphy, who serves as the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Counterterrorism, also targeted the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against a $1.5 trillion spending package to fund the government that included nearly $14 billion in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. \u201cWe need to call out the separation that exists between how Republicans talk and how they vote,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIn the end, Ukraine doesn\u2019t give a crap about what Republicans say at press conferences, they care about whether they\u2019re getting help or not.\u201d Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, one of the Republicans to vote against the bill, credited the Biden administration in a recent interview on MSNBC with \u201cbringing along some of the European central banks\u201d as it crafted its sanctions regime. But in a speech on the Senate floor last week, he argued that attaching funds for Ukraine to the larger bill was a cynical political ploy. \u201cThe reality is that the bill we voted on last week wasn\u2019t really about Ukrainian aid,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cUkrainian aid was a little bit of sugar on the larger medicine of a $1.5 trillion bill that nobody would actually want to go home and defend to the voters and to the taxpayers of America was well thought-out.\u201d Whether Biden\u2019s attempt to put rising gas prices on Putin\u2019s shoulders lands with voters and, in turn, deflects frustrations over a suite of frustrations with the economy is an open question. But a wide variety of polling so far has made one thing perfectly clear: Americans from both parties overwhelmingly support economic sanctions on Moscow and a corresponding import ban on Russian oil. Large majorities of voters have also, in multiple polls, indicated they are willing to sustain still higher gas prices as a result of the embargo. \u201cThat says that in the short term, Russia is seen as a real threat to national security. Now, how long that pain goes on and whether people start blaming Russia more and more for it, remains to be seen. But it is real,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, told CNN. But even bipartisan support for Biden\u2019s actions to date has not translated into a meaningful bump in the President\u2019s overall approval numbers or their views on his performance on Ukraine. In a recent Monmouth poll, partisan loyalties appeared to be the main drivers of a 46%-48% negative split on Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis, with 77% of Democrats giving a positive rating and only 18% of Republicans saying they approved. \u201cIn the past, when we\u2019ve seen a \u2018rally around the flag\u2019 effect, it\u2019s generally been around every aspect of Washington from the president on down,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd here we see results, perhaps for the first time, where Republicans just really can\u2019t get over the hump of saying that \u2018This is a president of a different party, ergo, I\u2019m going to judge him differently than I judge the actions that are being taken.\u2019\u201d The Russian war on Ukraine has also reignited or shone new light on intra-party debates for both Democrats and Republicans. GOP leadership has been unified in denouncing the invasion and calling for a more aggressive strategy from the White House. But some lawmakers rooted in the party\u2019s Trumpist grassroots have veered from those talking points and, in expressing concern over deeper US involvement in Ukraine, falsely claimed its democratically elected government \u201conly exists because the Obama State Department helped to overthrow the previous regime.\u201d Trump's endorsement power will be put to the test as May primaries approach The comment, in a video posted by Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who also suggested blame for the war rested with both Russia and Ukraine, was met with a sharp rebuke from Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the few Republicans eager to denounce her party\u2019s right-wing flamethrowers and the frequent target of former President Donald Trump who is now facing a primary challenge. \u201cPutin is targeting and slaughtering civilians in a brutal unprovoked war against Ukraine, a sovereign democratic nation,\u201d Cheney tweeted on March 17, in response to Greene\u2019s comments. \u201cOnly the Kremlin and their useful idiots would call that \u2018a conflict in which peace agreements have been violated by both sides.\u2019\u201d In North Carolina, where Republicans are jockeying for the party\u2019s nomination to replace retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr, former Gov. Pat McCrory released an ad earlier this month hammering Rep. Ted Budd, Trump\u2019s endorsed candidate, over what he described as Budd\u2019s sympathy for Putin. \u201cThese are serious times and we need serious senators,\u201d McCrory says in the spot. \u201cI don\u2019t compliment our enemies, I stand for truth and freedom.\u201d Politifact subsequently rated the claim in the ad that Budd \u201cexcused (Ukrainians\u2019) killer\u201d as \u201cmostly false,\u201d writing that some of the featured sound bites lacked context and excluded Budd\u2019s criticism of Putin, whom he has also described as a \u201cthug\u201d and \u201cevil.\u201d The back-and-forth presents a choice for Republican candidates over whether to remain in lockstep with Trump \u2013 who has described Putin as \u201csmart\u201d and \u201csavvy\u201d in remarks before and during the invasion \u2013 or to unreservedly criticize the Russian leader. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has sought to downplay intra-party tensions, saying on CBS Sunday that the \u201cvast majority of the Republican Party writ large, both in Congress and across the country, are totally behind the Ukrainians and urging the president to take these steps quicker, to be bolder.\u201d Democrats, though, see opportunities to pounce, pointing to Trump\u2019s long history of praise for Putin and the former President\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to produce political ammunition targeting Hunter Biden in exchange for already congressionally approved military aid \u2013 a move that ultimately led to his first impeachment. \u201cThe Republicans have a ton of baggage when it comes to their worship of Vladimir Putin,\u201d said Jay Chen, a Democratic congressional candidate in California\u2019s 45th Congressional District who is a Navy Reserve intelligence officer and the son of Taiwanese immigrants. The 45th District in Southern California is home to Little Saigon and large Vietnamese and Taiwanese populations. Chen said voters in the district are particularly empathetic for Ukrainian refugees because sizable numbers \u201cfled that type of authoritarianism\u201d that Putin is now imposing. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s what they fled to escape. And the Republican Party is embracing it and only haltingly turning away from it when they get called out,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI think this will last through November because we\u2019re dealing with a situation where there are no good options for Russia, and if Russia were to succeed, they\u2019d only succeed through more carnage, more violence.\u201d Democrats face less thorny questions over the conflict. The party is, even across its typically fractious ideological divides, in broad agreement over Biden\u2019s approach, which focuses on sanctions and has firmly ruled out any step, like the establishment and enforcement of a no-fly zone, that risks direct US military conflict with Russia. Some Democrats are also looking at the crisis in Europe as potentially illuminating moment for the American public on energy policy and its security implications. Progressives have long highlighted US dependence on fossil fuels pumped by autocrats in the Middle East and, to a lesser extent, Russia, as not only an environment scourge, but a strategic liability that prevents the country from asserting a human rights agenda for fear of risking relations with repressive governments in places like Saudi Arabia \u2013 and Russia. Leaders in the climate movement have expressed some cautious optimism that Putin\u2019s ability to insulate his economy from further damage because of its status, especially in Europe, as a key energy exporter could increase the impetus among congressional Democrats to pass a slimmed down form of the legislation formerly known as Build Back Better with significant investments in clean, renewable domestic sources. \u201cThere is an incredible opportunity to connect the dots for electeds making the case that we can no longer enable petrostate dictators like Vladimir Putin,\u201d said Jamal Raad, executive director of climate group Evergreen Action. \u201cAnd the only way we can do that is by moving to a clean energy economy. I think this is an incredible opportunity to make that case this summer and fall.\u201d Success in delivering on key pieces of the ambitious climate agenda Biden campaigned on in 2020 and pushed for during painful, and ultimately fruitless negotiations, last year would mark a significant victory for the White House and give Democrats facing reelection this year more strings in their electoral bows. Both Raad and Murphy cited a recent survey released from Data For Progress, a progressive Democratic think tank and polling firm, that showed broad bipartisan support \u2013 including a net 14-point advantage with Republicans \u2013 for the \u201cfederal government making investments to clean energy production in America.\u201d At a press conference last week, Democratic Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, along with Reps. Jim Langevin of Rhode Island, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Tom Malinowski of New Jersey and former foreign policy leaders, sought to make a clear connection between spending on clean energy as a means of breaking US dependence on fossil fuels from overseas and national security concerns. \u201cThe long-term solution,\u201d Crow said, \u201cis we continue a rapid and aggressive transition to renewable energy and cleaner sources of fuel that are cheaper, that will create more jobs, that are better for our economy, and will unleash us from the tether of tyrants and dictators around the world.\u201d Republicans, though, argue that conversations about clean energy are looking past the immediate economic pressure caused by rising gas prices. Kleefisch, the Wisconsin Republican gubernatorial hopeful, said Americans face a more immediate \u201caffordability crisis\u201d that those arguing for broad, long-term changes to the United States\u2019 energy economy are ignoring. \u201cThat\u2019s so out of touch with regular people, I can\u2019t even tell you.

            "article_content": "Madeleine Albright died just as the murderous historic forces that she had spent her career trying to quell are raging in Europe again, unleashed by a nemesis, Vladimir Putin, who she had consistently warned was a grave threat to peace. The first female secretary of state was exiled twice as a child refugee from the country of her birth, the former Czechoslovakia, by fascist and communist tyranny. That experience and the impact it had on her family forged her destiny as an academic, a diplomat and an American patriot. It also informed her approach to post-Cold War Europe and the shattering conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo during her time in the Clinton administration, as well as her strong support for NATO expansion into former Warsaw Pact nations. As he held Ukraine hostage before the invasion, Putin sought to force the Western alliance to reverse that move east. Albright\u2019s passing on Wednesday comes at a moment when Europe is again being swept by fears of a belligerent Russia, mass refugee flows, civilian carnage and the fear of nuclear war as Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine shatters 30 years of strategic stability. Biden and Clinton remember Albright as a 'force' for freedom around the world Until the end of her life, Albright was sounding the alarm about Putin\u2019s intentions and character and she predicted the strategic disaster and bloody resistance he would face if he invaded Ukraine. \u201cInstead of paving Russia\u2019s path to greatness, invading Ukraine would ensure Mr. Putin\u2019s infamy by leaving his country diplomatically isolated, economically crippled and strategically vulnerable in the face of a stronger, more united Western alliance,\u201d Albright wrote in an essay in The New York Times on the eve of the war last month. \u201cUkraine is entitled to its sovereignty, no matter who its neighbors happen to be. In the modern era, great countries accept that, and so must Mr. Putin,\u201d Albright wrote. \u201cThat is the message undergirding recent Western diplomacy. It defines the difference between a world governed by the rule of law and one answerable to no rules at all.\u201d Those words, some of the last Albright would publish, defined a diplomatic career characterized by staunch support for democracy and the right of people to live in freedom, but also a willingness to try to talk strongmen down, including Putin or the late North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Il, the father of the Stalinist state\u2019s current dynastic leader, whom she had visited in 2000. Albright had an early chance to examine Putin\u2019s character, and she was the first senior US official to meet the new Russian President, early in 2000, soon after he took over from Boris Yeltsin. She emerged from their first three-hour encounter in the Kremlin praising the Russian leader\u2019s \u201ccan-do approach\u201d as she sought ways to engage Moscow in order to avoid a return to the Cold War chill. But as she revealed in The New York Times last month, her private opinion, recorded as she flew home, was more scathing and ominous and has been borne out by subsequent events. Madeleine Albright's life in pictures \u201d \u2018Putin is small and pale,\u2019 I wrote, \u2018so cold as to be almost reptilian,\u2019 \u201d Albright recalled in the Times essay. She also quoted another of her impressions at the time that predicted more than 20 years of growing hostility to the West, which culminated in the invasion. \u201d \u2018Putin is embarrassed by what happened to his country and determined to restore its greatness,\u2019 \u201d Albright wrote, quoting her impressions at the time. Ironically, Albright used that meeting to try to convince Putin to show mercy in a war against separatists in the Russian republic of Chechnya, which involved a relentless bombardment that killed thousands of civilians. \u201cNeither of us minced words on Chechnya,\u201d she told reporters after failing to ease an offensive by Moscow that is now seen as a blueprint for the relentless bombing of civilians in Ukraine in a bid to break their will and resistance. Albright was generally supportive of efforts to convince Russia that NATO did not pose a threat to its security \u2013 at a time when the Obama administration tried to \u201creset\u201d relations with Moscow. But by 2014, when Putin annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in what was, in hindsight, a rehearsal for his march into the rest of the country last month, Albright was again warning of the Russian leader\u2019s wider ambitions. \u201cPutin is delusional,\u201d she said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d in March of that year. \u201cI think either he does not have the facts, he\u2019s being fed propaganda or his own propaganda,\u201d she said, responding to Russia\u2019s claims it had a right to be in Crimea, which mirror the Russian leader\u2019s justification for the wider war eight years later. Again, in 2016, Albright was warning of the need to confront Putin, calling him \u201csmart, but a very bad person\u201d in an interview with Austria\u2019s Die Presse. But Albright\u2019s domestic political loyalties as a Democrat had occasionally led her to disregard her own instincts. In 2012, for instance, she argued that then-Republican presidential nominee and now-Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah didn\u2019t know what he was talking about when he said Russia was the number one security threat. But unlike many others, she said \u201csorry.\u201d \u201cI personally owe an apology to now-Sen. Romney,\u201d Albright said at a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019. \u201cWe underestimated Russia, and Putin has put them back on the scene.\u201d Albright, a Georgetown University professor, had spent decades studying communist and fascist autocracy before she was plucked from relative obscurity to be then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. That experience also informed her outspoken criticism of ex-President Donald Trump, who she warned was a threat to American democracy long before his denials of his 2020 election loss and incitement of the US Capitol insurrection. Madeleine Albright Fast Facts \u201cI am not calling him a fascist \u2013 I am saying he has undemocratic instincts that trouble me a lot,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria in 2018. Albright put her comments about Trump in the context of the need to confront anti-democratic movements early on, before they mushroomed into dangerous extremism. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant demagoguery and hostility to refugees troubled her, especially as someone who had sought a haven from tyranny in the US. At the end of her life, Albright made no secret of her fear that vicious political forces of extremism, which had defined her destiny and caused so much carnage across the decades in Europe, were stirring again. \u201cI am in my 80s and I have seen an awful lot. It took me a long time to find my voice,\u201d Albright told Zakaria in the 2018 interview. \u201cI did not have a high-level job until I was 55 years old. And I\u2019m not going to shut up, frankly. I do think it\u2019s important for those who have seen these kind of things to put out a warning.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A massive spending bill that will fund the federal government through September \u2013 as well as provide $13.6 billion in fresh aid to Ukraine as the country fights back against Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 was signed into law by President Joe Biden Tuesday. The spending package, known as the omnibus, will provide funding through fiscal year 2022, which started in October. Lawmakers have been negotiating over the legislation for months and have passed three stopgap funding bills to keep the government running in the meantime. That means federal agencies have been funded at 2021 levels for the past five months. The text of the 2,741-page bill was released last week. Congress had to pass the legislation, or another stopgap bill, by midnight last Friday to avoid a government shutdown. The House passed the bill on Wednesday night and the Senate passed the bill on Thursday evening. The spending package calls for more than $1.5 trillion in annual appropriations, excluding the Ukraine aid. That\u2019s more than a 6% increase from the year before, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The legislation will provide $730 billion in non-defense funding \u2013 a 6.7% increase over fiscal year 2021 \u2013 the largest jump in four years, according to the House Appropriations Committee. It also will provide $782 billion in defense funding, a 5.6% increase over fiscal year 2021. Here\u2019s what some of the money will fund, according to summaries and fact sheets provided by the House Appropriations Committee: The law calls for an increase in funding for congressional offices by 21%, to $774.4 million, so they can recruit and retain a diverse workforce. It will be the largest boost in the Members Representational Allowance appropriation since its authorization in 1996. The package will also provide $18.2 million to pay interns. It will provide $602.5 million for the Capitol Police, an increase of $87 million. This will allow for the hiring of up to 2,112 sworn officers and 450 civilian members of the Capitol Police. The spending package will provide $12.6 billion for the Internal Revenue Service, an increase of $675 million, the largest since 2001. The funding boost is intended to help the IRS improve its customer service, increase enforcement, modernize its technology and improve its web applications. It also will provide special funding transfer authority and direct hire authority to help the agency deal with a massive backlog of returns and correspondence. The package will provide $75 million for election security grants to bolster state efforts to improve the security and integrity of elections for federal office. It also will give the Election Assistance Commission $20 million for operating expenses, a boost of $3 million. The law will provide $17.5 billion for high-poverty K-12 schools, an increase of $1 billion, the largest in more than a decade. And it calls for increasing funding for Head Start by $289 million to $11 billion. The maximum Pell Grant will increase by $400, to $6,895 a year. Pell Grants are generally awarded to undergraduate students with exceptional financial needs, and the amounts are based on their costs to attend school, family sizes and incomes. The increase will be the largest to the maximum Pell Grant in more than a decade, according to a summary of the bill. The Build Back Better package, which passed the House last year but stalled in the Senate, had called for increasing the maximum Pell Grant award by $550. The package will provide more funding for biomedical and behavioral research at the National Institutes of Health, which will receive $45 billion in funding, an increase of $2.25 billion. It will include $1 billion to establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health in order to speed up the pace of scientific breakthroughs for diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes and cancer. It will send $8.5 billion to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an increase of $582 million. And it will invest in the nation\u2019s public health infrastructure and public health and behavioral health initiatives, including $83 million for safe motherhood and infant health, an increase of $20 million, and nearly $212 million for mental health resources for children and youth, an increase of $25 million. The passage of the spending bill will allow the release of some of the funding authorized by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which passed in November. Due to a budgeting quirk, some of the money could not be spent until the fiscal year 2022 appropriations measure is signed into law. The restriction affects a portion of the funds slated for the federal highway program and public transit programs, for example. The law renews the Violence Against Women Act, which expired in 2018, by increasing funding for its prevention and prosecution programs, as well as efforts to reduce the backlog of unprocessed rape kits, according to a fact sheet. The package will provide $26.9 billion in funding for child nutrition programs, an increase of $1.77 billion above what was approved for fiscal year 2021. However, the spending law does not extend the pandemic waivers that provide schools with extra federal funds and increased flexibilities to cope with Covid-19 outbreaks, as well as supply chain and labor issues. A one-year extension of the waivers, which Congress originally approved in March 2020, would have cost $11 billion. The law will also authorize funds so that more fruits and vegetables can be included in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children food packages. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will get an increase of $4 billion over the previous year, for a total of $53.7 billion, according to a summary. Some of the funds will create 25,000 new Housing Choice Vouchers for low-income individuals and families at risk of homelessness, including survivors of domestic violence and veterans. Eligible people can use the vouchers to find their own housing and pay rent. The spending package will increase funding for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency by $568.7 million, for a total of $2.6 billion to prevent cyberattacks and protect critical infrastructure and communications systems, according to a fact sheet. A provision in the law targets vaping products that remained on the market despite growing efforts to clamp down on flavors that are especially popular among young people. It will move synthetic nicotine under the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s authority, according to an announcement Wednesday by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. While the FDA has authority over tobacco products, some companies have made their own synthetic nicotine in the lab. Because synthetic nicotine doesn\u2019t come from tobacco, companies have managed to circumvent the agency\u2019s oversight and keep their flavored products on shelves. Spending on defense and national security makes up more than half of the spending package. The measure calls for an increase in funds for military personnel, operations, research and the purchase of ground vehicles, aircraft, ships, munition and other equipment, according to a summary. The $13.6 billion would provide additional humanitarian, security and economic assistance for Ukraine and allies in the region. Roughly half of the aid package would be used to deploy troops to the region and send defense equipment to Ukraine, according to a summary of the bill provided by the House Appropriations Committee. The US has deployed thousands of troops throughout Europe, both before and during Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But putting troops on the ground in Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, is a line that the US and its Western allies have not been willing to cross. Much of the other half of the aid would provide humanitarian support for refugees fleeing Ukraine and people displaced within the country, including emergency food assistance, as well as help to respond to the economic needs in Ukraine and neighboring countries, such as cybersecurity and energy issues. The bill text originally included $15.6 billion to fund the government\u2019s Covid-19 response efforts in the US and around the world, including research and development of treatments and vaccines. But the funding was stripped from the bill in a last-minute effort to lock down votes last week. Republicans had pushed for the money to be offset by previously approved Covid-19 relief funds for state governments that had yet to be used, but many Democrats raised objections about the way those offsets were structured. Instead, House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, introduced a stand-alone bill with the Covid-19 response funds. But it\u2019s unlikely that the separate package would get the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence visited the Ukraine-Poland border on Thursday, meeting with refugees from Ukraine escaping the Russian invasion of their country. Pence was joined by his wife, Karen Pence, in a trip organized by minister Edward Graham and Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an American evangelical Christian relief charity. \u201cThe impact of the Russian invasion on these families is heartbreaking and the need for support is great,\u201d Pence tweeted Thursday alongside photos of his meeting. According to a person close to the Indiana Republican, Pence has over the years participated in several events with Samaritan\u2019s Purse, which is run by Franklin Graham, the son of the legendary Christian leader Billy Graham. (Edward Graham is the son of Franklin Graham.) Pence, who made the stop in Ukraine following a visit to Israel this week, has spoken out in recent days against the Russian invasion. Last week, he condemned \u201capologists\u201d for Russian President Vladimir Putin within his own party during a retreat with donors to the Republican National Committee. \u201cThere is no room in this party for apologists for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom,\u201d Pence said, according to a source in the room. Pence\u2019s remarks at the time came just days after his onetime ticket mate, Donald Trump, called Putin \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201csavvy.\u201d Pence\u2019s visit with the Ukrainian refugees comes as the Republican prepares for a potential White House run in 2024. His political activity through his advocacy group Advancing American Freedom has ramped up in recent months, including a recent $10 million ad buy targeting vulnerable House Democrats over Ukraine and US energy policy. In addition to forging a different path from Trump on Ukraine, Pence has begun speaking out more directly against the former President, particularly around issues involving the 2020 election and what led to the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. In a speech in Florida last month for conservative lawyers, he said Trump was \u201cwrong\u201d to suggest Pence could have done anything to change or delay the counting of the 2020 electoral votes. Pence condemned the idea as \u201cun-American\u201d and warned that Trump\u2019s position could be problematic for Republicans in the next presidential contest. \u201cUnder the Constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election, and (Vice President) Kamala Harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024,\u201d Pence said. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s location during his visit Thursday to the Ukraine-Poland border. He was in Ukraine.",

            "article_content": "As Russian President Vladimir Putin rattles the West with nuclear threats, President Joe Biden faces an even tougher-than-expected task in Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address. He must recognize the fatigue, suffering and pessimism in a nation exhausted by the Covid-19 pandemic, rocked by rising inflation and high gas prices and now suddenly thrown by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine into the worst geopolitical crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Then he must somehow conjure optimism about better times to come ahead of this year\u2019s midterms as he faces ebbing confidence among Americans that he has the plans, skills and endurance to end the crises. Biden hoped to spark a political reset at home with his first State of the Union address. A war in Europe changed those plans. At the same time, the President needs to send a message of US resolve amid fears the Ukraine crisis could spin out of control and trigger a direct clash with Russia, which has the world\u2019s most nuclear warheads. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN\u2019s Matthew Chance on Tuesday that Biden needs to give a \u201cuseful\u201d message during the speech. \u201cIt\u2019s very serious \u2026 I\u2019m not in a movie,\u201d Zelensky, a former comedy actor, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m not iconic, I think Ukraine is iconic \u2026 Ukraine is the heart of Europe, and now I think Europe sees Ukraine is something special for this world. That\u2019s why [the] world can\u2019t lose this something special.\u201d But any further escalation with Putin, who on Sunday ordered his nuclear deterrent to higher alert, carries significant risks. The Russian invasion of Ukraine shattered 30 years of relative peace in Europe after the end of the Cold War. The battle for Ukraine is the first real fight in the new war for dominance between autocracy and democracy, which the President has long predicted. Biden faces a rhetorical balancing act. He needs to avoid the impression that his role as the leader of the free world is distracting him from economic pain, rising crime, and the cascade of domestic crises that he inherited and promised to fix but has not yet done so. The unpromising political environment for Democrats \u2013 partly bequeathed by a President whose approval rating has dipped to 40% in CNN\u2019s average of the most recent national polls \u2013 is already playing out in nascent 2022 election campaigns around the country, where Democrats are finding out that strong job growth and an economic bounce-back despite the Omicron wave are being disguised by rising prices of basic goods. The Ukraine crisis is only driving gas prices higher. The Biden administration argues it has racked up a strong record of success, including the rollout of millions of vaccine doses, a pandemic relief plan that dramatically reduced child poverty and a bipartisan infrastructure law that eluded three recent presidents. But Biden\u2019s sweeping social spending and climate change bill has stalled, owing to obstruction by two moderate Senate Democrats, to the dismay of progressive base voters. Biden was never able to connect the long-term benefits of more home health care for seniors, free pre-K education and vast spending on new-generation energy sources to the immediate economic pain Americans have been facing. Biden to announce plan to lower costs for American families during State of the Union address The fate of his agenda may depend on Biden finally doing so on Tuesday night. When administration officials highlight the number of months of positive job growth or other statistics showing progress, they may be making a \u201ctechnically correct\u201d case, said Matt Mackowiak, a Texas-based Republican strategist and county party chair. But he added: \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t really reflect the mood that\u2019s out there right now.\u201d And the news in Ukraine is only further complicating Biden\u2019s efforts to connect with those everyday concerns. As Putin faces stronger-than-expected resistance in Ukraine, US officials and their allies are warily trying to anticipate his next moves as satellite images showed a more than 40-mile-long Russian military convoy reaching the outskirts of Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. After a classified briefing late Monday, several senators said they expect Russia to escalate its invasion as they called for additional military and humanitarian assistance. The UN confirmed on Monday that more than 500,000 refugees have fled Ukraine. And the acute danger faced by those who have stayed was heightened as Russian forces bombarded a residential area in Kharkiv, killing nine civilians, including three children, according to the city\u2019s mayor. Another 37 people were wounded. Russia's nuclear threats: What you need to know Late Monday night, Zelensky accused Russia of war crimes as he described the attack on Kharkiv from jet artillery \u2013 noting that Russian forces have launched 56 missile strikes and 113 cruise missiles in Ukraine over the span of five days. \u201cKharkiv is a peaceful city. There are peaceful residential areas, no military facilities. Dozens of eyewitness accounts prove that this is not a single false volley, but deliberate destruction of people: the Russians knew where they were shooting,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cThere will definitely be an international tribunal for this crime \u2013 it\u2019s a violation of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people.\u201d The Biden administration is hoping that the crippling financial sanctions that have now been placed on Putin, his inner circle and the broader Russian economy will accelerate a resolution to the crisis as Russia finds itself in an increasingly isolated position, largely cut off from the world banking system. By Monday, the ruble had crashed to a record low against the dollar and the Russian central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20%. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Biden will use his Tuesday address to highlight the global coalition that he helped build to sanction Russia, as well as the steps he has taken to \u201cmitigate the impact of President Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, on the global economy and the American people.\u201d She argued that Putin, through his actions, has become \u201cone of the greatest unifiers of NATO in modern history,\u201d another theme Biden is all but certain to touch on Tuesday. Biden ran for president touting his ability to repair and rebuild alliances abroad after four years of turbulence under former President Donald Trump. Though he did not initially expect Ukraine to be a focus of his State of the Union address, he may now be able to point to the united front of the US and its allies against Russia as evidence of the fruits of those labors. Though it is still too early in the conflict to predict how voters will assess Biden\u2019s handling of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, only 42% of Americans in a new CNN/SSRS poll say they trust him at least moderately to make the right decisions regarding the situation in Ukraine \u2013 a number that is both in line with his overall approval rating and the deep polarization of the country. US officials fear the worst is yet to come for Kyiv Even though his address is now expected to be more foreign policy focused, the President still needs to show how he is trying to shepherd the nation out of the Covid-19 pandemic while contending with the sour mood of voters hit by inflation and high gas prices \u2013 a problem that may only get worse as Goldman Sachs predicts that oil prices are likely to spike to $115 a barrel following the Russian invasion. In another ominous sign for Biden after consumer prices rose to a near-40-year-high in January, the investment bank\u2019s economists warned in new report Sunday that \u201cthe inflation picture has worsened this winter\u201d and \u201chow much it will improve later this year is now in question.\u201d One positive note for Biden is that the third spring of the pandemic is looking like its brightest. In the days ahead of the prime-time address, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new Covid-19 metrics suggesting that only about 28% of Americans live in a county where they need to wear masks indoors \u2013 a signal that the pandemic is waning and that people are resuming their normal lives. The Biden agenda faces its first test even before he speaks Tuesday, as Texas voters head to the polls in the first congressional primaries in the nation. Anthony Trejo, a 39-year-old Houston bartender who voted for Biden in 2020, said the President has handled Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine well because he has avoided direct military involvement. \u201cAs much as we want to help, there are consequences of helping that can be pretty bad,\u201d Trejo said. Biden, he said, \u201cis in a no-win situation.\u201d No one expects the midterms to be waged over Ukraine and foreign policy issues, but Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, who represents West Houston and its suburbs, said Americans have witnessed \u201creally skilled, thoughtful and engaged diplomacy\u201d and that \u201cthere is an opportunity for Americans to come together here around this issue.\u201d Still, the drag of Biden\u2019s low approval rating will be felt by Democrats even more acutely in red states like Texas, where Trump defeated Biden by 6 points, a slightly narrower margin than he posted four years earlier. But few are expecting those Democratic gains to hold in November, particularly when Trump \u2013 who alienated many voters in the suburbs \u2013 is not on the ballot. Voters in key swing states who are looking for someone to blame for the pinch in their pocketbooks give voice to the President\u2019s precarious position. Texas voters from both parties told CNN they thought Biden and the Democratic Congress handed out too much Covid-related aid and benefits \u2013 even though earlier aid packages began under Trump and were supported by Republicans. Democrats look to win back Latino voters after Trump's inroads in South Texas Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told reporters on a pre-State of the Union rebuttal call Monday that Democrats were to blame for pain in the checkout line and at the pump, as well as what she called \u201cmuddled\u201d Covid-19 guidance and rising crime in cities. \u201cRepublicans have the wind at their back at the moment,\u201d said Mackowiak. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how voters evaluate this Ukraine situation \u2013 we\u2019re in the early hours of that still. But one of the risks the Dems have is that more happy talk about the economy risks them looking really out of touch. Unless you\u2019re really, really, wealthy already and you\u2019re using your capital in a creative way, there are very few people who are doing really well right now, who feel like the economy\u2019s going great.\u201d But James Aldrete, a Texas Democratic strategist, noted that there are risks for Republicans in this moment, too, as the GOP continues to test the limits on culture war issues \u2013 which have been wielded as a torch by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott as he fends off challenges from his right. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Biden\u2019s numbers across the country are struggling. There\u2019s no doubt that Democrats are concerned about that (potential) backslide out of the suburban vote,\u201d Aldrete said. But he said he\u2019s closely watching whether Republicans can hang on to college-educated voters as GOP candidates continue to embrace Trump-like rhetoric. As Biden addresses the nation, the few competitive races in Texas are offering some evidence of how Democratic candidates may navigate the President\u2019s troubles this year. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the top Democrat challenging Abbott who narrowly lost his 2018 bid, has kept a laser focus on last year\u2019s power grid failures that left millions of Texans without electricity or running water in the midst of below-freezing temperatures. He has blamed Abbott for higher electricity costs and utility bills, shifting the focus to pocketbook concerns more tied to Austin than Washington, DC. \u201cNo one\u2019s really asking me about Congress or President Biden or federal issues,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in a recent interview in Brownsville as he knocked on doors. \u201cThey want Texas to get on the right track,\u201d he said.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. What happens when Rep.-elect George Santos of New York goes to Washington, DC, in January will be a real test of today\u2019s Republican Party. Does honesty and integrity matter at all? Or is GOP leadership so power-hungry that it will allow a serial fabulist to remain in office despite deceiving the public \u2013 and the voters who elected him \u2013 about key aspects of his biography? While running for office, Santos, who was elected in a district in New York that encompasses Long Island suburbs and parts of Queens, had either lied or been strangely cagey about everything from where he lived to which college he graduated from to where he worked to what his religious background was. The New York Times published an investigation of Santos\u2019s web of lies earlier this month, and got a very Trumpian attack-the-messenger denial from Santos\u2019 lawyer who, instead of providing any clarity or specific factual denials, simply said that it is \u201cno surprise that Congressman-elect Santos has enemies at The New York Times who are attempting to smear his good name with these defamatory allegations.\u201d A CNN KFile report, building on the Forward\u2019s reporting, further revealed how he had apparently misrepresented his Jewish roots, claiming his grandparents \u201csurvived the Holocaust\u201d as Ukrainian Jewish refugees who changed their last name to survive. But genealogist Megan Smolenyak told the KFile that \u201c\u201dThere\u2019s no sign of Jewish and/or Ukrainian heritage and no indication of name changes along the way.\u201d Santos\u2019 lawyer declined to comment at the time of publication. Now, more than a week later, Santos has admitted that the media outlets were mostly right, and he did indeed fudge his resume and much of his biography. Except he\u2019s still being less than forthcoming, claiming in a WABC interview that \u201ca lot of people overstate in their resumes, or twist a little bit.\u201d For example, he claimed he worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, listing specific roles he held in these organizations. Now he says he simply liaised with both companies through his actual employment at the company Link Bridge, and that a simple \u201cpoor choice of words\u201d gave a mistaken impression. That poor choice of words? Santos\u2019s campaign website said that he \u201cbegan working at Citigroup as an associate and quickly advanced to become an associate asset manager in the real asset division of the firm\u201d and  \u201cwas then offered an exciting opportunity with Goldman Sachs but what he thought would be the pinnacle of his career was not as fulfilling as he had anticipated.\u201d Reporter who broke the inconsistencies of GOP Rep.-elect Santos' resume says there's more to explore As for claiming he attended Baruch College and New York University and received degrees in finance and economics, Santos told the New York Post that \u201cI didn\u2019t graduate from any institution of higher learning. I\u2019m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume.\u201d But he also seemed to shrug this lie off. \u201cWe do stupid things in life,\u201d he said. Santos was similarly dismissive of reporting on his false claims of Jewish heritage. \u201cI never claimed to be Jewish,\u201d Santos said to the Post. \u201cI am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was \u2018Jew-ish.\u2019\u201d \u201cI never claimed to be Jewish, I claimed to be Jew-ish\u201d is indeed quite the dodge. Santos had also claimed that he lost four employees in the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. That wasn\u2019t true, either, although he now says it was four prospective employees; still, he didn\u2019t provide any names or other details. Santos even seems to have lied about his charity work. He claims to have founded the group Friends of Pets United, an animal rescue organization that was not registered as a charity in New York or New Jersey. According to New York Times reporting, the IRS has no record of it. The purported beneficiary of one $50-a-head fundraiser for Friends of Pets United says that she never received the money raised, according to the Times as well. Now, Santos is less clear about his work, saying he helped out the charity and found homes for the animals. One claim that Santos flat-out denied was a finding from the Times that he was charged with fraud in Brazil after writing stolen checks. According to the New York Times, \u201cIn the court file, Mr. Santos is identified by his full name and date of birth, as well as by the names of his mother and father. The documents show that Mr. Santos confessed to the crime and was charged, but that the case remains unresolved because authorities were later unable to locate him.\u201d \u201cI am not a criminal here \u2014 not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world,\u201d Santos told the Post. \u201cAbsolutely not. That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The Santos saga is utterly fascinating, in the way stories of scammers and con men are often so captivating. What makes a person lie so often and so brazenly? What makes someone whose resume is largely false put themselves in the public eye and under a media microscope by running for office? How is it possible that when this person finally gets caught, they don\u2019t slink away in shame, but rather lash out defiantly and simply refuse to face any consequences? There is no doubt that Santos deceived voters in his district. The case he made for his candidacy was based, at least in part, on his experience and his resume. And he has proven himself wholly untrustworthy, which is particularly salient given many of the outstanding questions about his finances and net worth. So why should the public trust anything further he says, given his egregious pattern of lying, dissembling and then downplaying his own lies? And how should the GOP respond?  Republican Party leaders could certainly pressure Santos not to take office. They could publicly denounce him, and say that their party stands for honesty and will not stand for brazenly lying to constituents. That may end with their party losing the seat in a special election, but that\u2019s hardly a foregone conclusion; and at some point, principles have to trump power. If he insists on taking office anyway, they could launch an ethics investigation and/or withhold committee assignments from him. It\u2019s a sad reflection of today\u2019s GOP, though, that I assume that they won\u2019t do any of this. And so far, party leaders have largely stayed silent. Nassau GOP Chair Joe Cairo, one of the few Republican leaders to speak out, said Santos would have to do a lot to regain trust, but added that Santos should be able to serve his term in Congress. But let\u2019s be clear \u2013 Santos is exactly who you don\u2019t want in office. He is a man who seemingly has no problem lying for self-aggrandizement and personal gain; a man who, even when caught, demonstrates little remorse or accountability; a man who still insists that he should be vested with significant political power. New Yorkers deserve better. And the Republican Party should demand better.",

Bergen is the author of \u201cThe Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. In the Trump White House, Jared and Ivanka Kushner were famously referred to as \u201cthe interns.\u201d Now, Jared Kushner has written a book about his internship, modestly titled \u201cBreaking History,\u201d in which he casts himself as a diplomatic genius \u2013 a latter-day Metternich with a solid dose of Henry Kissinger thrown in. Describing his time in government, he writes: \u201cHumbled by the complexity of the task, I orchestrated some of the most significant breakthroughs in diplomacy in the last fifty years.\u201d And that\u2019s just in the preface. The nearly 500 pages that follow are rife with this kind of self-congratulatory puffery. To be fair, Kushner was arguably the most important person in the Trump administration after his mercurial father-in-law. But that was less about his abilities and more because he was one of the very few people \u2013 along with his wife and Olympic-level sycophant Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 who had seemingly guaranteed job security in an administration known for its rapidly revolving door. At the Trump White House, Kushner was allowed to dabble in pretty much anything he wanted, while never officially taking responsibility for many of those roles \u2013 an enviable position to be in when things didn\u2019t go well. He took over the portfolios of China, Mexico, the Middle East and NAFTA. When the coronavirus hit, he became one of the de facto Covid-19 leaders as well. By Kushner\u2019s own account, he performed brilliantly in all of these gigs, a fact that, in his view, would be more widely recognized if only other senior administration officials hadn\u2019t been so incapable of appreciating his inestimable talents. Kushner recounts an episode in which Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, supposedly drafted a resignation letter for Kushner to sign. Kushner takes the opportunity to settle some scores with a number of those top officials, including Bannon, former Trump chief of staff John Kelly, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Kushner\u2019s real-world experience before entering the White House was running his family real estate company. In that role, he presided over what was arguably the worst real estate deal in Manhattan\u2019s history: Buying 666 Fifth Avenue for a record $1.8 billion in 2007, which became a financial albatross when the recession hit a short time later. Kushner also purchased the New York Observer, which he reportedly used to attempt to undermine his rivals and suppress unflattering stories about his cronies. The Observer went entirely digital in 2016, and CNN reported at the time that its influence had \u201cdiminished\u201d since Kushner had taken it over. Never mind those failures: When Trump took the White House, Kushner became the go-to guy on an ever-widening set of portfolios. On NAFTA, which Trump called \u201cthe worst trade deal ever,\u201d Kushner inserted himself into the re-negotiations around the trade accord. But, in the end, the deal that he struck, which was rebranded as the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA),was a lot like the old NAFTA. The new deal included relatively minor changes, such as opening up the Canadian market to US dairy farmers and requiring automobiles to have a higher percentage (75% instead of 62.5%) of their components manufactured in the three countries in order to qualify for zero tariffs. Kushner presented the USMCA as momentous (\u201cI helped renegotiate the largest trade deal in history\u201d) despite the fact that the changes between NATFA and USMCA were \u201cmostly cosmetic,\u201d according to a Brookings Institution analysis of the new deal. Kushner can certainly count the \u201cAbraham Accords\u201d as an achievement, given that two small Gulf monarchies, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain, signed deals recognizing the state of Israel for the first time during the Trump administration. Kosovo, Morocco and Sudan all forged ties with Israel as well. But the Abraham Accords hardly compare with the 1978 Camp David Accords that then-President Jimmy Carter brokered between Egypt and Israel, two countries that had been at war for decades. The UAE and Bahrain, meanwhile, had never fought a war with Israel, and the fact that they normalized relations with the Jewish state was more about creating a coalition against their common enemy Iran than Kushner\u2019s brilliant negotiations. Yet, Kushner recounts his role with blustering bravado: \u201cGetting this deal done was like trying to land a plane on an aircraft carrier in the middle of a storm.\u201d Alrighty. A key part of Kushner\u2019s plan to bring peace to the Palestinian territories was to secure $50 billion of investment for Palestinian projects. But both the Palestinians and the Israelis boycotted the much-ballyhooed Palestinian investment conference that Kushner hosted in Bahrain in June 2019. And there doesn\u2019t seem to be evidence that Kushner\u2019s investment plans ever came to fruition. Kushner also seems to have forgotten the original purpose of why he took up the \u201cpeace process.\u201d It was purportedly to bring about a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Jared Kushner is starting an investment firm and leaving politics for the foreseeable future Kushner seemed to be operating on the theory that normalizing relations between Israel and the Arab states would cause the Arab countries to push the Palestinians to agree to a two-state solution. Providing significant Arab investment in the Palestinian territories would also help sweeten the deal. But none of that worked and by the end of the Trump administration, the two-state solution seemed more a mirage than ever. Meanwhile, the Trump administration gave then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 an old family friend of the Kushners \u2013 pretty much everything he wanted: pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal, reversing American policy and declaring that it did not consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank a violation of international law and withdrawing US support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which among other things, educated hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinian kids living as refugees in countries around the Middle East. Trump\u2019s first overseas visit was to Saudi Arabia, a trip that Kushner had pushed hard for. Shortly after the trip, the Saudis imposed a blockade on Qatar, which had long found their enormously wealthy neighbor to be an irritant. The Saudis knew that with President Barack Obama in the White House, a blockade of Qatar likely wouldn\u2019t fly, but the Trump-Kushner team was another matter. It\u2019s unclear whether Trump and Kushner were either unaware or simply didn\u2019t care that Qatar sits on some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world and is also home to the largest US military base in the Middle East. The two Trump cabinet officials who knew the most about Qatar, Tillerson, who was previously the chairman and CEO of Exxon, and then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who had commanded CENTCOM, were both angered by the blockade. But Kushner sidelined them both on the Qatar issue. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, knew that the one person who really counted in all this was Kushner, who had his back. The absolute Gulf monarchies who run their fiefdoms as family businesses had a shrewd understanding of where the power really resided in the Trump administration. Kushner\u2019s relationship with MBS, who the CIA concluded ordered the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, has certainly proven lucrative. Against the advice of its own board of advisers, a Saudi sovereign wealth fund led by MBS reportedly invested $2 billion in Kushner\u2019s newly formed private equity firm just six months after Trump left office. This extraordinarily cushy deal goes unmentioned in Kushner\u2019s very long book. In fairness to Kushner, he certainly did get some things right. One of most important events in his adult life was, inarguably, the imprisonment of his father Charles Kushner, who was convicted of witness tampering and several other charges after he hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law in a New Jersey hotel room while a hidden camera rolled. As part of the revenge plot, he then sent the tape to his own sister, who along with her husband, had been cooperating with the feds in an investigation into Charles Kushner\u2019s campaign contributions. He was sentenced to two years, and his son movingly describes visiting his father every weekend at the Alabama prison where he was incarcerated. Why we're celebrating a three-month-old law Given this personal experience, Kushner campaigned for prison reform during his time in the Trump White House and helped create a coalition with Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and CNN commentator Van Jones, among others, to move this bipartisan measure through Congress. The resulting reforms helped address some of the disparities in sentencing between crack cocaine convictions and powder cocaine offenses that tended to penalize Black offenders It also lowered mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent crimes and gave judges the leeway to dole out more lenient sentences to those who deserved them. Kushner also deserves credit for helping orchestrate the Trump administration\u2019s vaccination program, known as \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d during the pandemic. The government invested $1 billion in Moderna, which produced a testable vaccine in just a matter of months and placed another $1.5 billion order for 100 million doses of the vaccine. And while Pfizer didn\u2019t directly take US government money in the research phase, the administration did strike an advance-purchase deal with the company to obtain more than 100 million doses for $1.95 billion. Yet, Kushner never grapples with his father-in-law\u2019s role as a one-man super-spreader of lies and disinformation. This surely contributed to many unnecessary deaths during the pandemic, given Trump\u2019s influence on his supporters and the key role that the president\u2019s bully pulpit plays in American life. Early on, Trump repeatedly downplayed the severity of the pandemic, saying the virus would \u201cgo away\u201d or \u201cdisappear.\u201d Trump also denigrated mask-wearing and almost invariably refused to wear a mask himself at a time when vaccines were not yet available and masks were one of the most effective ways to curb the spread of the virus. Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, told a House select subcommittee that that the Trump administration\u2019s botched response to Covid-19 proved lethal for many tens of thousands of Americans. If the administration had followed the science and implemented more mitigation measures, she testified, \u201cWe probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range.\u201d  Kushner also gives his father-in-law a free pass on spreading falsehoods about the 2020 election being stolen from him. At one point, Kushner writes that \u201c2020 was full of electoral anomalies\u201d without saying exactly what they were. He also credits Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani with efforts to overturn the election, while Kushner himself remained focused on Operation Warp Speed and his Middle East peace efforts. Of course, Kushner also fails to acknowledge his father-in-law\u2019s role in fomenting the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he makes the now debunked claim that \u201cno one at the White House expected violence that day.\u201d In fact, Cassidy Hutchinson, a top aide to the White House\u2019s chief of staff, testified publicly under oath in June that Trump\u2019s national security adviser and the deputy chief of staff for operations had raised the issue of potential violence in the days before January 6. For readers looking for a robust defense of the Trump administration that makes no pretense to being an impartial account, Kushner\u2019s \u201cBreaking History\u201d is the book for you. For those who are looking for a more wide-ranging and balanced accounting of Trump\u2019s four years in office, I\u2019m looking forward to Peter Baker and Susan Glasser\u2019s book, which is scheduled for release next month, as well as Maggie Haberman\u2019s, which will be out in October.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: William Han (@w_t_han) is a writer and lawyer. His book \u201cFrom the Wall to the Water\u201d will be published in September. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. On the day in early March when my father passed away, I went to visit my grandparents\u2019 final resting place at the military cemetery on Mt. Wuzhi just outside Taipei. Partly it was because I was in Taiwan, the place of my birth and early upbringing, whereas Dad was in New Zealand, where my family had moved to in the 1990s. There was nothing I could do about the pandemic travel restrictions that prevented me from getting to his side. But I also went to the cemetery out of a sense of being a member of a dying breed. The Russian invasion of Ukraine had recently begun. Images of young Ukrainians rushing off to join the fight were fresh in my mind as I looked for the spot where my grandparents\u2019 ashes were interred. I couldn\u2019t help but reflect that these Ukrainian teens were now doing exactly what my grandparents did when they were at that age: in 1937, when news of the Japanese invasion of China reached their respective villages, both of my grandfathers and one grandmother left home to enlist in the Army of the Republic of China (ROC). The Russian invasion has touched off a wave of soul-searching in Taiwan. Just as Ukraine faces a much larger and more powerful neighbor that seeks to absorb it, so Taiwan faces the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) that claims the island as its own. If war should come, the Taiwanese wonder, will they be as brave as the Ukrainians have been? Will they fight for their homeland just as tenaciously? Families like mine also think of our forebears\u2019 legacy of service, which has made us who we are. My grandparents\u2019 choice to volunteer in the Second World War led to them taking the side of the Nationalist or Kuomintang (KMT) government against the Communists in the subsequent Chinese Civil War. Victory by the Communists and the establishment of the PRC on the Chinese mainland in 1949 then led to their migration, essentially as refugees, to Taiwan under the auspices of the KMT government now in exile. Opinion: Biden shouldn't confuse Taiwan with Ukraine So it was that my family became part of the ethnic minority in Taiwan known as the \u201cwaishengren,\u201d literally \u201cpeople from outside the province.\u201d The term contrasts with the \u201cbenshengren,\u201d \u201cpeople from this province,\u201d referring to those descended from Chinese settlers who arrived by 1895, when China ceded Taiwan to Japan at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War before recovering it again in 1945. But the waishengren identity is on the verge of fading away. My father\u2019s passing, like my grandparents\u2019 some years earlier, has brought us that much closer to extinction. The waishengren were always a minority in Taiwan: estimates put them at as little as 12% of the Taiwanese population. After the 1949 exodus, however, they dominated the ROC government, being chiefly members of the military or KMT officials and their families. The KMT then ran an authoritarian regime until managing a gradual transition to full democracy in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the once-persecuted Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is in power, and the KMT is the largest opposition party. More representative of the benshengren majority who feel little attachment to the land of their distant ancestors, the DPP is seen as favoring de jure independence from China. Western media often seem to sympathize with this end of the Taiwanese political spectrum. In contrast, my father once in a while used to tell me: \u201cSon, don\u2019t forget we\u2019re Chinese.\u201d To waishengren true-believers like him, the ROC ought to be the legitimate government of all of China, and we are its rightful heirs. The tragedy for him was that that dream of the Republic died in 1949. This late in history, there is no realistic chance of reviving it. The waishengren identity is on the verge of fading away. My father\u2019s passing, like my grandparents\u2019 some years earlier, has brought us that much closer to extinction. William Han Demographics were not on my father\u2019s side. As the 1949 generation have mostly died out, and with second-generation waishengren aging, younger people naturally have less and less attachment to China. It doesn\u2019t help that the PRC continues on its authoritarian course while the Taiwanese have come to take pride in their democracy. An opinion survey published this week by the Election Study Center, National Chengchi University, shows that 63.7% of Taiwanese now identify solely as Taiwanese, up from 17.6% in 1992. A mere 2.4% now identify solely as Chinese, dropping from 25.5% in the same timeframe. And 30.4% today identify as both Taiwanese and Chinese. And, little by little, the DPP government is building a Taiwanese identity distinct from the Chinese. Particularly irksome to waishengren is the DPP\u2019s policy of \u201cde-Sinicization\u201d in education. A new curriculum, implemented in 2019, strips away millennia\u2019s worth of substance on Chinese history and literature. The curriculum reclassifies Chinese history as a part of \u201cEast Asian history\u201d rather than the history of our own country. It skips over entire epochs such as the Three Kingdoms and fails to mention historical figures that used to be absolutely basic knowledge. Anecdotes of young people\u2019s ignorance have shocked waishengren parents. Touching off public debate, one Taiwanese writer recently reported that her teenaged daughter and her classmates didn\u2019t know Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic. The US steps up its game as China circles the Pacific Another controversy arose over the daughter of Terry Gou, one of Taiwan\u2019s most prominent businessmen, who was allegedly unaware of the Song Dynasty national hero Yue Fei. A household name in generations past and traditionally considered the paragon of service to country, Yue Fei might well have been on my grandparents\u2019 minds when they set off. I would love for the Taiwanese government to reverse course on de-Sinicization, but I\u2019m not holding my breath. In time, with younger generations increasingly educated under the new shibboleths, the sort of waishengren who insist on their Chinese cultural identity will cease to exist. The sort of waishengren like my family. The sort of waishengren who take pride in the valor and patriotism of their parents and grandparents, as the Americans lionize \u201cthe Greatest Generation\u201d who stormed the beaches of Normandy, as the British speak proudly of their grandparents who served in the Battle of Britain, as today\u2019s Ukrainians take pride in their courageous defenders. There once was a dream called the Republic of China. It was a dream for which my grandparents were prepared to give their last full measure of devotion. It remains to be seen whether, when push comes to shove, the builders of today\u2019s nascent Taiwanese nation will be equally prepared to sacrifice for their ideal. It remains to be seen whether the Taiwanese will hang together in the event of war, now that some of them may still love the lost Republic while others try to bring forth a new one.  My father always remembered my grandparents\u2019 legacy. I, too, shall always remember it \u2013 even if in the end our memories cannot live forever. We shall rage against the dying of the light.",

She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. At first glance, there\u2019s no immediately apparent connection between Elon Musk\u2019s efforts to control Twitter, the war in Ukraine and the recent election in France. And yet, there was a perplexing similarity in the current of unease that gripped the world as all three of these events unfolded this past week. If you consider it closely, you can see the common thread. They may be thousands of miles apart in geography and substance, but at the heart of each lies a concern about the future of democracy. Whether it\u2019s Ukraine fighting Russia\u2019s efforts to destroy its independence as a democracy, or France pushing back against a far-right populist and Putin apologist, or apprehension over what might become of Twitter \u2013  that cauldron where conspiracy theories, election lies and disinformation campaigns can cook up a brew capable of infecting society and tearing a country apart \u2013 we\u2019re all witnessing the great challenge of our times play out around us. For the past 16 years, democracy has been losing ground to authoritarian rule around the world, according to the watchdog organization Freedom House. Authoritarian leaders, Freedom House warns, are working together to undercut democracy and human rights around their world, seeking to discredit the competition and spread their model of government. The challenges to global democracy are deeply worrisome, but it\u2019s not all dismal. In fact, the current crises have created unexpected opportunities. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign to erase Ukraine\u2019s nationhood and counter NATO has already backfired on multiple fronts. By unwittingly fortifying and uniting NATO, boosting Ukraine\u2019s national identity and eroding Russia\u2019s standing, Putin may have just created the conditions to strengthen the forces of democracy. For several years, Putin, along with other authoritarian leaders, have tried to use propaganda brigades to sow divisions among Americans in an attempt to weaken the West and prove to their own people that their system is superior. It didn\u2019t help that the US political discourse was dominated by divisive squabbles, many of which were fomented by politicians with authoritarian, populist leanings. It\u2019s no wonder democracy had been losing ground as people grew exhausted, apathetic and disgusted with politics. But Russia\u2019s brutal and unprovoked war, which has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties, has shown us just what is at stake. And many who have taken democracy for granted and viewed it with jaded eyes, now understand that it is in need of safeguarding. Opinion: Escapees from Mariupol tell of 'hell on Earth' In Europe, there are early glimmers that the wave of antidemocratic populism may have crested. In the United States, the country remains deeply divided, but it is coming together on the issue of Ukraine with an intense bipartisanship that would have been hard to imagine just a few months ago. Americans overwhelmingly support Ukraine\u2019s right to set its own democratic course. And nearly three out of every four Americans back the efforts to supply Ukraine with weapons, according to a Reuters/IPSOS poll, with strong majorities among both Democrats and Republicans saying they prefer candidates in November\u2019s midterm elections to support arming Ukraine. And a war launched by a Russian leader who has turned deranged conspiracy theories into government policy shows just how dangerous misinformation is. In the US, majorities of Democrats and Republicans say the spread of misinformation about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is a major issue, according to an AP-NORC poll. Americans are also worried about their own democracy, telling pollsters that they\u2019re concerned that Russia will try to interfere with the midterms through misinformation and disinformation on social media. Concerns of interference also played a role in the presidential election in France last weekend. One key issue was far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and her party\u2019s still-outstanding loans from Russian banks. She had also previously expressed admiration and respect for Putin, and denied the fact that Russia had illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, all of which raised questions about her independence from the Kremlin. Opinion: The Republican blueprint to steal the 2024 election And given that Russia has used social media to further its goals, it\u2019s no wonder there has been a fierce debate about the future of Twitter. The platform, which provides a direct port into America\u2019s political bloodstream, has tried to rein in extremists, conspiracy theorists and those who used it to divide the country with hate speech, disinformation and propaganda. It\u2019s unclear precisely what Musk\u2019s plans are for Twitter, but his rhetoric suggests he might make it more, not less amenable to extremism and divisiveness. During an on-stage interview at the TED conference earlier this month, Musk said, \u201cIf in doubt, let the speech exist. If it\u2019s a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist. But obviously in the case where there\u2019s perhaps a lot of controversy, you would not necessarily want to promote that tweet.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s the issue of whether former President Donald Trump \u2013 who used Twitter to rise to power and perpetuate a conspiracy theory about widespread election fraud that inspired a mob to attack the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 \u2013 will be reinstated under Musk in a move that could very well propel him back into the political limelight ahead of the 2024 election. And the prospect of a more inflammatory Twitter amid a raging war already ridden with disinformation makes the risk more palpable to Americans concerned about democracy both at home and abroad. Of all the polls about Americans and Ukraine, perhaps none is as stunning at this: 78% of Americans said they support the resettlement of 100,000 Ukrainians refugees in the United States, according to Gallup. That level of public support is the highest Gallup has found for admitting refugees since 1939. For context, only 26% said they\u2019d support bringing 10,000 refugee children from Germany in 1939; 16% said they supported more Jewish and other European refugees than were strictly allowed by law to be admitted in 1946, just after World War II. Clearly, the war in Ukraine has touched a nerve in the American psyche. The deep sympathy and concern for the Ukrainian people and the outrage over Putin\u2019s push to usurp their freedom has sparked  a renewed appreciation for democracy.  But this growing consensus will not on its own save America from its ills. It will not by itself reverse the tide of authoritarianism sweeping the globe. It does, however, present an opportunity.  Americans don\u2019t have to agree on everything. But to move forward, the country needs to come together on at least two crucial points: that democracy must survive and that truth must be respected. That consensus is materializing not a moment too soon. Those who worried about a pro-Putin populist winning in France; about Twitter turning into a more powerful weapon for disinformation, hate and division; and about the fate of Ukraine, have created an opening for responsible, eloquent and principled political leaders. They must seize the moment and try to bridge the widening divisions that have emerged in the US in order to put it back on a path to becoming a stronger, united and lasting democracy.",

View more opinion on CNN. \u201cWomen are like teabags. You never know how strong they are until you put them in hot water.\u201d So says Gillian Anderson in the new Showtime series \u201cThe First Lady,\u201d in which she \u2013 in her portrayal as Eleanor Roosevelt \u2013 regularly speaks in aphorisms, at one point providing her husband Franklin (played by Kiefer Sutherland) with his most quotable line, \u201cWe have nothing to fear but fear itself.\u201d And near the end of the first episode, she offers a pithy summary of her own position. Pressed by an aide to attend a meeting because it is her job as First Lady, Roosevelt shoots back, \u201cThat\u2019s not a job. That\u2019s my circumstance.\u201d The shifting circumstance of life as First Lady is the thread tying together the three women the series follows: Eleanor Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama. All three chafe at the central contradiction of the role, one that ushers them to the center of national power not through their achievements but through their husbands\u2019, offering new avenues of influence while strictly policing how they use that influence. Yet even as these First Ladies are linked in their struggle to navigate their \u201ccircumstance\u201d (aka unpaid labor), the rights and opportunities American women gained in the years between Roosevelt and Obama also fundamentally transformed the First Lady\u2019s role. It was transformed from a rare path to power into an anachronistic \u2013 and possibly unnecessary \u2013 position. The series is more interested in the continuities than the differences, in part because of its structure. The show constantly bounces from the 1930s to the 1970s to the 2000s (and sometimes even introducing flashbacks to other times, like when it cuts to the 1880s to show the funeral of Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s mother). To provide some cohesiveness to an otherwise fractured approach, the series stresses the ways the women are similar: their ambivalence about the office, their relationships with their mothers and daughters and mother-in-laws. But that approach obscures the radically different contexts in which they were working. When Roosevelt became First Lady in 1933, women were only just beginning to gain access to leadership roles in national government. A few decades earlier, Julia Lathrop became the first woman to head a federal agency when she was appointed to lead the newly formed Children\u2019s Bureau (nearly all leadership roles filled by women would be associated with the bureau due to its connections to children and maternal health). And the same year Roosevelt became First Lady, Frances Perkins became the first woman to become a member of the cabinet when she was sworn in as secretary of labor. In that environment, Roosevelt was already unusual: She had been a political partner to her husband since he was first elected to the state senate in New York in the 1910 election. \u201cThe First Lady\u201d shows her advising her husband, encouraging him to remain in politics after polio left him partially paralyzed and finding spaces for activism even in her early days as First Lady. Anderson brings some of the steeliness she performed as Margaret Thatcher in \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2013 though here it feels more natural, despite the prosthetic teeth and tucked chin meant to amplify her resemblance to Roosevelt. That steeliness was a requirement for Roosevelt, who regularly outpaced her husband as she pressed for issues like civil rights for Black Americans, the protection of refugees and New Deal programs for women. The first episode also hints at how Roosevelt would transform the office of First Lady, at least during her tenure. Starting during her husband\u2019s first term and continuing for decades after her time in the White House, she wrote a syndicated newspaper column six days a week, called \u201cMy Day.\u201d As First Lady, she held regular press conferences and advised her husband on policy matters. Though she had very little formal institutional power, she transformed the office of the First Lady into one capable of wielding an enormous amount of cultural and political sway in an era where few other platforms allowed that kind of reach. Roosevelt\u2019s activism as First Lady was controversial at the time, and did not become a typical model for those who followed. (Nor did Secretary Frances Perkins; despite her successful tenure, only one other woman, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Oveta Culp Hobby, would serve in the cabinet before the 1970s.) By the time Betty Ford, played by Michelle Pfeiffer in a captivating and nuanced performance, became First Lady, the role had largely reverted to one of hosting and entertaining, with occasional small projects defined by their links to domestic life. Ford never quite fit into these constraints of the role. The least famous of the three First Ladies in the series, and the only one who escapes caricature, she is introduced dancing by herself in a pink quilted robe, cocktail in hand, real estate brochures littering the floor. She is in the midst of dreaming of retirement and a more private life just days before her husband is unexpectedly plucked from Congress to become Richard Nixon\u2019s vice president after Spiro Agnew\u2019s abrupt resignation the same day he pleaded no contest to a charge of federal tax evasion (in return for the dropping of political corruption charges). But as her husband became vice president and then, just as unexpectedly, President when Nixon himself resigned at the culmination of the Watergate scandal, Ford began expanding the First Lady role in ways that reflected and drew energy from the second-wave feminism. The show hints at this: In a speech delivered before other congressional wives as her husband was being considered for vice president, she shares \u2013 champagne glass at hand \u2013 that rumors her husband had sought psychiatric help were in fact meetings he had with her psychiatrist, a shocking admission in an era when mental-health treatment carried a heavy stigma. Amid a growing movement that proclaimed \u201cthe personal is political,\u201d Ford\u2019s decisions to disclose to the public not only her psychiatric treatment but her addiction to alcohol and pills and her breast cancer diagnosis were not just confessional but political acts. So, too, was her decision to speak out on politics. She advocated for the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights, two issues that were splitting the Republican Party in the 1970s. In that way, she used her role as First Lady, a position established as part of a set of traditional assumptions about women and their work, to promote feminist ideas. Michelle Obama (played by Viola Davis, a phenomenal actor whose portrayal is an unfortunate lip-pursing imitation) came into office in a very different historical era. Though in the series she is portrayed primarily as a moral compass for her husband, far more interesting are the moments when she is shown in her pre-First Lady career, as a vice president for University of Chicago Hospitals. Unlike Roosevelt, who builds a career in tandem with her husband, Obama built hers outside the world of politics. Becoming First Lady, then, means not only facing new threats (the show is particularly concerned with the vulnerability of the first Black President) but giving up that career to fit herself into a political role defined by its ties to domestic life. Those constraints were a function not only of the role of First Lady but of the significant changes in women\u2019s opportunities outside that role. Far more women filled the House and the Senate than when Ford was First Lady. Far more women sat on the Supreme Court and in the cabinet. Women\u2019s political opportunities seldom ran through their husbands any more. In an earlier era, women primarily entered elected office through widow\u2019s succession \u2013 women filling the seats of their deceased husbands. Now they ran for office outright. And while they did not have equal representation (the proportion of women in elected office is still well below their share of the population), their significant presence in office made the First Lady\u2019s office, once one of the few places where women could exercise power nationally, feel like a vestigial part of pre-liberation politics.  The premiere episode of \u201cThe First Lady,\u201d eager to draw parallels between the women, flattens these historical changes. It wants to show three reluctant women thrust into a circumstance and then finding ways to turn that circumstance to their advantage: as a route to push for policies, as a platform for feminist ideas, as a megaphone to become the moral conscience of the nation. But to really understand the office and its limitations, the show will also need to linger on the contradictions of the First Lady\u2019s office \u2013 a potentially powerful political perch that is both unpaid and a product of marriage rather than achievement. Those contradictions accumulated quickly with the rise of second-wave feminism. They were clear during Hillary Clinton\u2019s time in office. Her attempt to carve out a significant policymaking role faltered; she ultimately leveraged her position into a successful Senate run, where she gained the experience to twice run for President. But the contradictions are also clear in Jill Biden\u2019s time in office: Mocked for her use of the title \u201cDoctor,\u201d she has retained her job as a college professor. In \u201cThe First Lady,\u201d Roosevelt rejects the notion that the role is actually a job, even though she would be the first to leverage the role for real political influence. The question remains, though, whether it should be a job. While First Ladies have at times used the office to do meaningful work, the idea that presidential spouses are required to spend most of their time as glorified hosts seems increasingly out of touch. The women in \u201cThe First Lady\u201d make the most of their circumstances, but the show is a reminder that they may have been better served by not being forced into those circumstances in the first place.",

The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. \u201cLithuania stands for us. Latvia stands for us.\u201d In a video speech to European Union leaders on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky listed the countries that have shown solidarity with his people. Then he came to Hungary, and his tone changed. \u201cHungary\u2026. I want to stop here and be honest. Once and for all. You have to decide for yourself who you are with. Listen, Viktor, do you know what\u2019s going on in Mariupol?\u201d Zelensky\u2019s comment referenced the juggling act Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who faces parliamentary elections on Sunday, has performed since Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine began just over a month ago. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has come to symbolize the global conflict between autocracy and democracy, and the upcoming elections in Hungary, just days from now, stage that struggle. It is unclear whether right-wing populist Orb\u00e1n\u2019s decade-long friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin will harm him at the polls. Toeing a delicate line in his relations with Putin, fellow EU member states and voters, Orb\u00e1n has tried to present neutrality as in Hungary\u2019s best interests. Yet staying out of Putin\u2019s war will become less feasible the longer the conflict goes on. In 2022, the world's strongmen could fall on their Covid-19 swords Orb\u00e1n, ever the nationalist, justifies his \u201ccautious, pragmatic stance\u201d on Russia\u2019s war as a defense of Hungarian well-being and security. On the same day Zelensky pointed the finger at Hungary during his European Union address, Orb\u00e1n posted a photo on his Facebook page of NATO leaders posing and the tagline: \u201cWe support Hungarian interests. We will not let Hungary be dragged into this war!\u201d Likewise at a rally on March 15, he declared to supporters, \u201cWe must stand up for our interests\u2026 We must stay out of his war.\u201d In reality, Orb\u00e1n, Putin\u2019s closest ally in the EU, has never been neutral when it comes to Russia. When the country annexed Crimea in 2014, Orb\u00e1n was reluctant to impose EU sanctions, arguing \u201csecurity in the region can only be achieved with Russia.\u201d Shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, Orb\u00e1n declared 2021 the best year yet for Russian-Hungarian relations, citing Putin\u2019s \u201crespect\u201d for Hungary. While the Hungarian leader has criticized the invasion and opened the country\u2019s eastern border to Ukrainian refugees, he has also refused all measures that could assist Ukraine\u2019s military defense, like letting weapons be transported via its territory. Orb\u00e1n also rejects sanctions on Russian energy, which would be the most impactful sanctions against Putin, who has long used Russia\u2019s rich oil and gas supplies as leverage with Germany, Serbia, and other European nations. Similarly, Orb\u00e1n is also clear about his disdain for democracy. In twelve years of illiberal rule, he has rolled back press and judiciary freedoms and demonized non-white migrants in the name of keeping Hungary predominantly White and Christian. Its repressive laws against LGBTQ individuals, which a referendum on the same day as the election seeks to further, have already sparked European Commission legal proceedings against Hungary. This is why the upcoming elections, which present an unprecedented challenge to Orban\u2019s power, matter. Six parties, including his former far-right Jobbik party allies, have come together in a coalition to try to defeat him. Led by Peter M\u00e1rki-Zay, a 49-year-old conservative provincial mayor, they are united in their opposition to what M\u00e1rki-Zay calls Orb\u00e1n\u2019s \u201ccorrupt dictatorship.\u201d Hungary plans referendum on law criticized by EU as homophobic Orb\u00e1n has the incumbent advantage in this election \u2013 his control of the electoral machinery and judiciary make challenges to election results much harder to win. The war has also been a distraction from Hungary\u2019s economic woes, and the government is betting that tax rebates and pension and wage increases will sway voters more than the opposition\u2019s promises to roll back autocratic abuses. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government control of media coverage is also a key part of any success at the polls. In the 2018 parliamentary elections, censorship and state media influence meant that \u201copposition views could not even reach significant portions of the electorate,\u201d as analyst G\u00e1bor Polyak\u2019s wrote. Since then, media control has intensified. M\u00e1rki-Zay says he has not been asked to be on television since 2019. Finally, war is unsettling. Many Hungarians \u2013 particularly in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party heartlands outside the city centers \u2013 may rather \u201cstay out of it,\u201d seeing Orb\u00e1n\u2019s pragmatic and cautious stance as sensible. Right now, it doesn\u2019t appear as though Orb\u00e1n\u2019s muted response to Putin has seriously dented his popularity, and the election race seems close. A March 23 poll gives Orb\u00e1n and his Fidesz party 41% of the electorate, and the opposition 39%. Yet, even if Orb\u00e1n stays in office, his model of governance founded on the repression of rights, may become less appealing, and his solidarity with Putin an increasing liability. A Publicus think tank survey shows that even among Fidesz voters, 44% see the Russian attack as an aggression. And 60% of respondents to a recent Euronews poll felt that Hungary has gotten too close to Russia and Putin. Hungary may also increasingly find itself isolated within Europe, as its ideological ally Poland sees the benefits of solidarity with democracies. In December 2020, the European Parliament approved a \u201crule of law conditionality\u201d that linked the availability of EU funds to members states\u2019 respect for democracy. Before the war started, Poland and Hungary launched a legal challenge against it, but the European Court of Justice rejected it. Orb\u00e1n relies on EU funds, most recently for assistance with Ukrainian refugees, so enforcement of this rule could make things difficult for him.  Ultimately, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s hedge of \u201cstrategic calmness,\u201d and his desire to avoid displeasing Putin, make the Hungarian opposition coalition appear as the resolute and principled force in Hungarian politics. \u201cWe have to choose Europe, West, NATO, democracy, rule of law, freedom of the press, a very different world. The free world,\u201d says Marki-Zay. That message will likely gather momentum in Hungary, no matter what happens in this election.",

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. President Joe Biden concluded his powerful speech this weekend in Poland about Vladimir Putin\u2019s barbaric attack on Ukraine with this line about the Russian leader: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201d White House officials later sought to make it clear Biden was not calling for \u201cregime change,\u201d but it was no gaffe. Biden is 100% correct. Putin \u2013 whom Biden has rightfully called a \u201cwar criminal\u201d \u2013 should not remain in power given his horrific attack on Ukraine, his role in slaughtering civilians in Syria and his efforts to undermine Western democracies, including during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Biden didn\u2019t hold back in what will likely be seen as a historic speech Saturday just hours from the Ukrainian border. The president appealed directly to the Russian people, telling them, \u201cI refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards that, for God\u2019s sake, are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs.\u201d Biden also shared his emotional conversations with Ukrainian refugees earlier that day, recounting how he \u201csaw tears in many of the mothers\u2019 eyes as I embraced them; their young children \u2013 their young children not sure whether to smile or cry.\u201d And he shared the story of what they said to him such as \u201cone little girl [who] said, \u2018Mr. President\u2019 \u2013 she spoke a little English \u2013 \u2018is my brother and my daddy \u2013 are they going to be okay? Will I see them again?\u2019 \u201d The world has seen the horrors Putin has rained down upon the people of Ukraine simply because they won\u2019t bend a knee to this brutal dictator and agree to give up their democracy and self-determination. Biden's Europe trip has achieved one key goal The civilian death toll in Ukraine has exceeded 1,100 people \u2013 including nearly 100 children \u2013 according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, but it notes the actual figures are likely considerably higher. Some of the most horrific events include the actions of Putin\u2019s forces in the March 16 bombing of Mariupol\u2019s Drama Theater \u2013 a shelter for civilians \u2013 killing about 300 people, according to Ukrainian officials. And as The New York Times documented last week, Russian forces have bombed at least 23 hospitals and other health care infrastructure, 330 schools and 27 cultural buildings as well 900 houses and apartment buildings. The paper also detailed Russian forces have used cluster munitions, which are imprecise and amount to indiscriminate bombings of civilians. Biden has been right to call Putin a \u201cwar criminal\u201d and even a \u201cbutcher,\u201d as he stated Saturday after visiting Ukrainian refugees in Poland. No one who engages in an unprovoked attack on another nation and then in war crimes should remain in power. War crimes expert: Russian invaders are crossing a line But Putin, the \u201cmurderous dictator,\u201d as Biden has also described him, engaged in these types of gruesome attacks on civilians in Syria as well, beginning in 2015 when his forces provided military support to keep Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in power. Putin\u2019s forces in Syria \u2013 as in Ukraine now \u2013 bombed hospitals, schools, markets and other civilian targets. Putin\u2019s military devastated Syrian cities and in the process slaughtered more than 24,000 civilians, as The Guardian detailed, citing civilian casualty monitor Airwars. Beyond those apparent war crimes, Putin has been actively working to undermine Western democracies. For example, in France\u2019s 2017 presidential election campaign, Russian operatives reportedly spread disinformation in an effort to hurt the candidate they opposed, the moderate Emmanuel Macron, while boosting the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen. And of course, in the United States, as the Mueller report documented, \u201cThe Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.\u201d The report further noted \u201ca Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton,\u201d explaining \u201cthe Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome.\u201d Biden on Saturday reiterated a point he has made time and time again since becoming President, namely the world is locked in a contest between democracy and autocracy. During his inaugural address on January 20, 2021 \u2013 just two weeks after the January 6 attack on the Capitol \u2013 he declared, \u201cWe have learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile.\u201d It\u2019s why just a month later during his virtual speech at the Munich Security Conference, Biden said, \u201cDemocracy doesn\u2019t happen by accident. We have to defend it, fight for it, strengthen it, renew it.\u201d It also explains why in December his administration organized the Summit for Democracy, which brought together democratic leaders from around the world to tackle the threat of autocratic forces such as Putin. Near the end of his speech Saturday, Biden returned to this theme as he explained the world is caught in \u201ca battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression.\u201d  In keeping with that point, he slammed Putin\u2019s ambitions, declaring \u201ca dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people\u2019s love for liberty.\u201d Instead, Biden promised \u201ca brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities.\u201d That is when Biden said about Putin, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201d All I can say in response is: Amen.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cPresidents come and go,\u201d said William Howard Taft, \u201cbut the Supreme Court goes on forever.\u201d Taft was uniquely qualified to make that judgment. Eight years after he finished his one term as President, Taft was appointed Chief Justice of the United States \u2013 the only person to ever hold both offices. When Taft was nominated for the Court in 1921, he even observed, \u201cI don\u2019t remember that I ever was President.\u201d Under the Constitution, presidents can veto the legislation Congress passes and Congress can, in turn, override those vetoes. But when the Supreme Court pronounces on the law, its decisions are effectively final. Unless they are impeached and removed, justices serve for life. Two stories relating to their awesome power dominated US politics last week. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman nominated to the Supreme Court, faced \u2013 and by many accounts, ably handled \u2013 questions from a Senate committee examining her candidacy. And then, late on Thursday, Justice Clarence Thomas, who has served on the court since 1991, came under new scrutiny. CNN, the Washington Post and CBS News reported that his wife, Ginni Thomas, sent numerous texts to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to continue in the fight to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory so that Donald Trump could remain in office. \u201cIn text messages to Meadows, Ginni Thomas called Election Day a \u2018heist\u2019 and repeated debunked theories about evidence of election fraud,\u201d wrote Elliot Williams. \u201cThomas actively weighed in on the makeup of Trump\u2019s legal team, with a particular focus on ensuring that Meadows help Sidney Powell be \u2018the lead and the face\u2019 of the team. She weighed in directly on legal strategy, saying \u2018(s)ounds like Sidney and her team are getting inundated with evidence of fraud. Make a plan. Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down.\u2019\u201d Ginni Thomas is entitled to her opinions, but the issue for Justice Thomas is whether he should have recused himself from cases relating to the election and the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, Williams noted. \u201cIn February 2021, Justice Thomas wrote a dissent after the majority declined to hear a case filed by Pennsylvania Republicans that sought to disqualify certain mail-in ballots. In January 2022, Thomas was the only justice who said publicly that he was against allowing the release of records from the Trump White House related to the Jan. 6 attack \u2026 the glaring appearance of a conflict is more than enough to justify Justice Thomas\u2019s stepping aside from all matters related to January 6.\u201d If Thomas doesn\u2019t recuse himself from participating in January 6-related cases, Williams argued, no one \u201cshould be shocked that America has lost faith in its highest court.\u201d (Justice Thomas returned home Friday after a weeklong hospital stay for what a court spokesman described as an infection.) In The New York Times, Jesse Wegman wrote that \u201cYes, married people can lead independent professional lives, and it is not a justice\u2019s responsibility to police the actions of his or her spouse. But the brazenness with which the Thomases have flouted the most reasonable expectations of judicial rectitude is without precedent. From the Affordable Care Act to the Trump administration\u2019s Muslim ban to the 2020 election challenges, Ms. Thomas has repeatedly embroiled herself in big-ticket legal issues and with litigants who have wound up before her husband\u2019s court. All the while, he has looked the other way, refusing to recuse himself from any of these cases.\u201d Republicans had promised to make Jackson\u2019s confirmation hearings respectful and expressed their determination to avoid the fierce pyrotechnics that characterized the nominations of Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork. In Peniel E. Joseph\u2019s eyes, they failed. Sen. Marsha Blackburn\u2019s \u201cinaccurate and blatantly racist attempts to patronize Jackson while twisting her sterling record into a scare narrative of GOP bogeymen \u2013 critical race theory, the 1619 Project and controversies over transgender athletes and women\u2019s sports \u2013 were staggering yet unsurprising,\u201d Joseph wrote. \u201cTom Cotton of Arkansas and Missouri\u2019s Josh Hawley, two of the most conservative and Trump-loving elected officials in the nation, attempted to attack Jackson as being soft on crime and unusually lenient in sentencing child sex offenders (an assertion that a group of retired federal judges rejected, finding her sentences \u2018entirely consistent\u2019 with that of other judges across the country).\u201d Republicans seemed well on their way to castiing \u201cno\u201d votes on Jackson\u2019s nomination, despite her top-notch legal credentials and her expression of a judicial \u201cmethodology\u201d that sounded awfully like the one conservatives espouse. Jeffrey Toobin wrote that she spoke \u201cof the \u2018limited\u2019 role of the judiciary and her desire to \u2018stay in (her) lane\u2019 as a judge rather than as a legislator. Jackson has said further that she begins her analysis of the Constitution and laws always with the \u2018text.\u2019 She has gone out of her way not to embrace a belief in a \u2018living Constitution,\u2019 an interpretative method based on the idea that the meaning of the Constitution must be seen in light of changing conditions in society at large.\u201d Once confirmed, Jackson would likely mostly rule with the liberals on the court. \u201cBut language matters, and the way we talk about the Constitution often dictates what the Constitution comes to mean,\u201d noted Toobin. \u201cBy emphasizing the importance of constitutional text as a restraint on judicial discretion,\u201d wrote Adam J. White. \u201cJackson sounded like conservative former Justice Antonin Scalia at times.\u201d Jackson\u2019s hearing resonated outside legal circles, wrote Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center. On day one, she wrote, \u201cThe photojournalist Sarahbeth Maney captured an image of one of Jackson\u2019s daughters as her mother testified before the committee. While her mother smiles in the foreground, Leila Jackson beams with pride behind her, visibly filled with the respect for her mother many parents dream to see.\u201d \u201cWhen the punditry is over and Judge Jackson hopefully is confirmed as Justice Jackson, this will be the legacy of her rise to the Supreme Court: A young Black girl, one of a generation of Black girls, joyful at the sight of new possibilities for her own life.\u201d In The Washington Post, Dana Milbank questioned the sincerity of the GOP senators\u2019 self-styled war against \u201cthe elites,\u201d noting the prestigious universities attended by Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and others. He called Sen. Tom Cotton \u201ca counterfeit commoner\u201d who \u201cannounced with indignation at this week\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings that he doesn\u2019t want a justice who follows the \u2018views of the legal elite.\u2019 He later complained that \u2018a bunch of elite lawyers\u2019 such as nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2018think that sentences for child pornography are too harsh. I don\u2019t and I bet a lot of normal Americans don\u2019t, either.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd who is this \u2018normal American\u2019 decrying the \u2018legal elite\u2019? Why, he\u2019s a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, a former clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and a former associate at two Washington-insider law firms who now sits on the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate,\u201d Milbank pointed out. Julian Zelizer noted that \u201cWhile the \u2018soft on crime\u2019 line of attack might seem like a predictable extension of a decades-long Republican \u2018law and order\u2019 strategy, commentators have pointed out that the senators may have been trying to appeal to those who follow QAnon and believe the conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump is locked in a battle against a group of elites who run a child sex ring.\u201d \u201cSen. Ted Cruz\u2019s version of \u2018gotcha\u2019 was to hold up books that had been assigned or recommended at a private school in Washington where Jackson is a board member, trying to make the case that they covered radical concepts unfit for children. Throughout the confirmation hearings, Republicans tried to score cheap political points by delving into bizarre lines of argument \u2013 all of which revealed how fringe talking points had become mainstream.\u201d For related views: SE Cupp: Cameras in the courtroom? We don\u2019t need more theatrics Mary R. Ziegler and Aziza Ahmed: The war on abortion will fail Thursday marked one month since the Russian military launched an unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin\u2019s war has taken a horrific toll on the people of Ukraine, with civilians killed and cities ruined. But now evidence is emerging that it has also weakened the Russian military and created new risks for the man who ordered them to fight. \u201cQuagmire,\u201d defined by Oxford Languages as a \u201csoft boggy area of land that gives way underfoot\u201d is one way to look at the Russian invasion, which is not only bogged down but deadly. After one month of war, casualties among Russian troops in Ukraine are estimated to be as high as 15,000 \u2013 roughly the same number of losses the Soviet military sustained over nine years during the failed invasion of Afghanistan, wrote Peter Bergen. \u201cThis was surely not how Putin dreamed of restoring Russia\u2019s glory, a dream that is fast turning into ashes \u2013 just as Putin has reduced the Ukrainian city of Mariupol to ashes,\u201d Bergen wrote. \u201cWhen the Soviet military departed Afghanistan in 1989, the countries and populations of Eastern Europe \u2013 then under varying degrees of the Soviet yoke \u2013 took note. If the feared Soviet army couldn\u2019t win a war on its own borders against Afghan guerrilla forces, what did it say about its ability to control the fates of East Germany, Hungary and Poland?\u201d  \u201cThe failure of the Soviet war in Afghanistan hammered a giant nail into the coffin of the Soviet empire,\u201d Bergen observed. \u201cIt\u2019s not an accident the Berlin Wall fell just months later, opening up East Germany to the West.\u201d Writing from Lviv, Michael Bociurkiw noted the Ukraine war\u2019s impact: \u201cupwards of 10 million people have been displaced, several thousand dead and injured and cities such as Mariupol completely flattened.\u201d \u201cIt is Mariupol which has become ground zero for the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe that has not only shocked the world, but where red lines, which should have been established by the West, were crossed \u2013 such as the strike earlier this month on a maternity ward that killed a pregnant mother and her unborn child.\u201d The West shouldn\u2019t have been surprised at the flow of refugees fleeing Putin\u2019s aggression. It began with attacks on Georgia in 2008 and moved on to Russia\u2019s invasion in Ukraine in 2014, wrote Olena Stiazhkina. \u201cOver the last two weeks, the year 2014, which never ended, has been attacking me from all sides. In the spring of that year, back in my native Donetsk, I began to act like the local madwoman, muttering under her breath and occasionally screaming: \u2018Tanks! War! The Russians are coming!\u2019\u201d \u201cSince I moved to Kyiv, I\u2019ve kept up this persona. For years, I\u2019ve been looking people in the eye and telling them: \u2018There will be war. There will most definitely be war.\u2019\u201d In a chilling account of his time in Syria, Dr. Hamza al-Kateab wrote, \u201cI will never forget the first time I saw Russian warcraft in the skies above Aleppo. It was September 2015, I was in my garden with my wife Waad and a friend when we saw three Russian aircraft flying over together, launching a missile attack. I knew at that moment that everything was about to change.\u201d \u201cAs a Syrian doctor and former hospital director in Aleppo, I know exactly what it means to be a direct target for the Russian forces.\u201d \u201cThe war crimes that are being committed in Ukraine right now are, unfortunately, nothing new. They are no coincidence. Attacks on health care facilities are a strategic play by Russian and Russian-backed Syrian regimes and they have been attempted, developed and repeated for at least the past 11 years.\u201d Why attack hospitals and medical centers? \u201cIt makes it impossible for people to live in a city,\u201d wrote al-Kateab. \u201cHow can people stay when the places they rely on for their health and safety have become a direct target? These attacks force people out. And most importantly, it is an attempt to break their resilience. It is an attempt to break their hope.\u201d Boris Romantschenko was a teenager living in eastern Ukraine when Nazi invaders deported the men in his village to Germany and forced him to work in a coal mine. When he tried to escape, he was imprisoned and eventually assigned to more forced labor camps. Among them was an island in the Baltic Sea, where he had to help assemble the V2 rockets used to bomb London and Antwerp in 1942. As Jens-Christian Wagner wrote, Romantschenko was later freed by the British when they liberated the Bergen-Belsen camp in 1945. Wagner, a history professor who serves as director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, added that even then, Romantschenko couldn\u2019t get back to Ukraine. Instead, he was drafted by the Soviets into the Red Army which occupied East Germany. Eight years after his original capture by the Nazis, he finally returned to his home. \u201cRomantschenko spoke to schoolchildren about his experiences and urged us to safeguard peace and freedom and to protect human rights. \u2018I wish you the best of luck from the bottom of my heart, and I hope that no one ever has to go through what we former prisoners experienced,\u2019 he said in 2013.\u201d Earlier this month, a Russian missile struck Romantschenko\u2019s apartment building in Kharkiv, killing him, Wagner wrote. \u201cHitler could not defeat our friend Boris. Now another fascist dictator, Vladimir Putin, has killed him.\u201d For more: Frida Ghitis: Biden\u2019s Europe trip has achieved one key goal David Andelman: Putin just made the case for a European army Amelia Glaser: Zelensky\u2019s Ukraine is real. Putin\u2019s doesn\u2019t exist Europe\u2019s dependency on fuel from Russia has helped fund Putin\u2019s war machine, as Jeremi Suri and Clark Miller wrote. \u201cFor more than a century, the world\u2019s addiction to fossil fuel has undermined international security and entangled the US and Europe in damaging relationships with authoritarian regimes, from Saudi Arabia to Iran to Indonesia.\u201d In the wake of Ukraine\u2019s invasion, they argued, \u201cWe must end the role of fossil fuels as the primary energy source for global markets.\u201d \u201cAccomplishing that goal requires severely curtailing worldwide demand for oil: We need to aggressively pivot to electric vehicles and to build out global green hydrogen for use by industry and heavy transportation. And that demands the kind of integrated innovation, manufacturing, and deployment efforts pioneered by the Manhattan Project\u201d during World War II. \u201cA Manhattan Project today would entail rapidly expanding the manufacture of electric cars, solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, electrolyzers, heat pumps, and a wide variety of other technologies.

But she will also be remembered for the force of her intellect and drive. Elmira Bayrasli, fresh off an internship at the US Embassy in Ankara, went to work as an aide for Albright in the mid-1990s when she was the US Ambassador to the UN. \u201cI had a front row seat to the workings of international diplomacy,\u201d wrote Bayrasli. \u201cNow, some 25 years later, I realize that I also witnessed the early makings of feminist foreign policy, which though initially focused on the issue of gender, has evolved to ensure human rights, democracy and, most importantly, stability.\u201d \u201cAs a refugee to the US from then-Czechoslovakia, she very much believed in America\u2019s role as \u2018the indispensable nation\u2019\u2013 a nation based on the values of advocating for the oppressed and actively upholding human rights. Of course, that sometimes meant using the might of the American military to stand up for those values.\u201d \u201cHer political philosophy also put her at odds with those who didn\u2019t believe the US should get involved in wars that did not directly impact the US, including the one that broke out in the crumbling Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, where Serbs resisted the creation of independent Bosnian and Croatian states.\u201d Gene Seymour: The Oscars aren\u2019t really the Oscars anymore Richard N.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news. \u201cThe United States is coming to an end. The question is how.\u201d Those are the jarring opening lines of Canadian author Stephen Marche\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Next Civil War: Dispatches from the American Future.\u201d Released the same week as the anniversary of the January 6 attack on our Capitol that signaled how dangerous our political polarization has become, Marche\u2019s book shares different scenarios of how the United States could collapse. Marche isn\u2019t the only Canadian worried about their southern neighbor\u2019s future. Just days before Marche\u2019s book released, political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon \u2013 the executive director of the Cascade Institute, which focuses on ways to address threats to society \u2013 penned a powerful op-ed in Canada\u2019s \u201cGlobe and Mail\u201d that begins with a similar warning. \u201cBy 2025, American democracy could collapse, causing extreme domestic political instability, including widespread civil violence,\u201d Homer-Dixon writes. \u201cBy 2030, if not sooner,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe country could be governed by a right-wing dictatorship.\u201d As Americans, our first instinct when a person from outside of the US says something critical of our nation is often to dismiss the comment (or mock their country; be honest!). In this case, though, neither Marche nor Homer-Dixon wrote their words to belittle America or to make Canadians feel better about their country. In fact, as Marche explained on my SiriusXM radio show last week, it\u2019s the opposite: Marche wrote his book because he \u201cloves\u201d the US after working and living within its borders off and on for years. His hope, he says, is to warn Americans of where the nation is going before it\u2019s too late. The question the GOP must answer about January 6 In the case of Homer-Dixon, the warning is even more unnerving because the column is addressed not to Americans but to his fellow Canadians, to prepare them for what may be heading their way if America\u2019s democracy does collapse. Homer-Dixon bluntly cautions his compatriots: \u201cA terrible storm is coming from the south, and Canada is woefully unprepared.\u201d When Canadians start to counsel one another on the threat posed to American democracy, you know we\u2019re in a dire position. This is not about scoring political points; rather, it emanates from a place of sincere concern for their own nation. It\u2019s a sobering reminder that if our democratic republic ends it will have repercussions not just for our nation but the world \u2013 from bolstering autocratic leaders, such as the type that former President Donald Trump had praised, to undermining Western democracies. Homer-Dixon\u2019s words carry real weight: As he says, for more than 40 years he\u2019s studied the causes of war, revolution and social breakdown. \u201cToday,\u201d he wrote to his countrymen and women, \u201cas I watch the unfolding crisis in the United States, I see a political and social landscape flashing with warning signals.\u201d You can't troll the President with 'Let's go, Brandon' and then play the victim To those who might view his premonitions as over the top, Homer-Dixon adds, \u201cWe mustn\u2019t dismiss these possibilities just because they seem ludicrous or too horrible to imagine. In 2014, the suggestion that Donald Trump would become president would also have struck nearly everyone as absurd.\u201d (Point taken with that one!) This scholar of violent conflict highlights the range of factors currently plaguing the US and contributing to our institutions\u2019 vulnerability, from growing income inequality to demographic change that has caused some \u201cright-wing ideologues\u201d to inflame \u201cfears that traditional US culture is being erased and Whites are being \u2018replaced.\u201d (Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson has long been peddling this \u201creplacement theory\u201d \u2013 although he\u2019s denied that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing \u2013 and he\u2019s been rightfully denounced. And at least one other GOP elected official, Rep. Matt Gaetz, has joined him, claiming Democrats are \u201cimporting new voters\u201d from other countries. As with Carlson, Gaetz insisted his views had nothing to do with race.) Homer-Dixon even believes that using the \u201cF word\u201d \u2013 fascism \u2013 to describe the state of the GOP is accurate, citing the perspective of Canadian-American conservative David Frum: \u201cTrumpism increasingly resembles European fascism in its contempt for the rule of law and glorification of violence.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. But what truly resonates with me is Homer-Dixon\u2019s assessment that the \u201cunderpinning\u201d of our politics \u201cis a vital set of beliefs and values,\u201d and \u201cif a substantial enough fraction of a population no longer holds those beliefs and values, then democracy can\u2019t survive.\u201d This is the revelation America is still waiting for Alarmingly, a recent NPR/Ipsos poll found that two-thirds of Republicans agree with the demonstrably false statement that \u201cvoter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election.\u201d Fewer than half of Republicans, the poll found, agree that they are willing to accept the election\u2019s proven results. How can we have a functioning democratic republic when one side apparently believes that only elections they win are \u201clegitimate\u201d? The fact so many Republicans reject the results of the 2020 election was likely part of the motivation behind this memorable line in President Joe Biden\u2019s speech one year following the January 6 attack: \u201cYou can\u2019t love your country only when you win.\u201d For Homer-Dixon, all of this adds up to a crucial question for his country: How can Canadians prepare for the worst? For one, he says, \u201cWe need to start by fully recognizing the magnitude of the danger.\u201d He continues, \u201cIf Mr. Trump is re-elected\u201d and ushers in a right-wing authoritarian regime, \u201cThe risks to our country in their cumulative effect could easily be existential, far greater than any in our federation\u2019s history.\u201d For example, he theorizes, \u201cWhat happens \u2026 if high-profile political refugees fleeing persecution arrive in our country, and the U.S. regime demands them back. Do we comply?\u201d Biden just threw down the democracy gauntlet To prepare for that kind of possible scenario, he implores Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to \u201cimmediately convene\u201d a committee with representatives from the various political parties in government who \u201cshould receive regular intelligence analyses and briefings by Canadian experts on political and social developments in the United States and their implications for democratic failure there.\u201d There\u2019s been a lot of talk lately by American leaders on the threat posed to our democracy by today\u2019s GOP. Former President Jimmy Carter wrote an op-ed for the New York Times titled, \u201cI fear for our democracy,\u201d raising concerns that since the January 6 attack, \u201cpromoters of the lie that the election was stolen have taken over one political party and stoked distrust in our electoral systems.\u201d  But there\u2019s something deeply compelling about reading the words of Canadians who have no skin in the game of American politics to offer such blunt words and warnings about the red flags they are seeing. As Marche details in his book, there are Americans who hold a \u201cdesperate faith in their country\u2019s institutions that amounts nearly to delusion.\u201d These Canadians are warning us to break free of those delusions and instead understand that \u201cit\u201d can happen here \u2013 with \u201cit\u201d being anything from fascism to a civil war that would collapse our democracy \u2013 and to get a grasp on this reality before it\u2019s too late.",

            "article_content": "Three men, eyes closed and heads bowed, pray before a rough-hewn wooden cross. Another man wraps his arms around a massive Bible pressed against his chest like a shield. All throughout the crowd, people wave \u201cJesus Saves\u201d banners and pump their fists toward the sky. At first glance, these snapshots look like scenes from an outdoor church rally. But this event wasn\u2019t a revival; it was what some call a Christian revolt. These were photos of people who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, during an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The insurrection marked the first time many Americans realized the US is facing a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement. This movement uses Christian language to cloak sexism and hostility to Black people and non-White immigrants in its quest to create a White Christian America. A report from a team of clergy, scholars and advocates \u2014 sponsored by two groups that advocate for the separation of church and state \u2014 concluded that this ideology was used to \u201cbolster, justify and intensify\u201d the attack on the US Capitol. Much of the House January 6 committee\u2019s focus so far has been on right-wing extremist groups. But there are plenty of other Americans who have adopted teachings of the White Christian nationalists who stormed the Capitol \u2014 often without knowing it, scholars, historians, sociologists and clergy say. White Christian nationalist beliefs have infiltrated the religious mainstream so thoroughly that virtually any conservative Christian pastor who tries to challenge its ideology risks their career, says Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of the New York Times bestseller, \u201cJesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.\u201d \u201cThese ideas are so widespread that any individual pastor or Christian leader who tries to turn the tide and say, \u2018Let\u2019s look again at Jesus and scripture,\u2019 are going to be tossed aside,\u201d she says. The ideas are also insidious because many sound like expressions of Christian piety or harmless references to US history. But White Christian nationalists interpret these ideas in ways that are potentially violent and heretical. Their movement is not only anti-democratic, it contradicts the life and teachings of Jesus, some clergy, scholars and historians say. Samuel Perry, a professor of religious studies at the University of Oklahoma who is authority on the ideology, calls it an \u201cimposter Christianity.\u201d Here are three key beliefs often tied to White Christian nationalism. One of the banners spotted at the January 6 insurrection was a replica of the American flag with the caption, \u201cJesus is My Savior, Trump is My President.\u201d Erasing the line separating piety from politics is a key characteristic of White Christian nationalism. Many want to reduce or erase the separation of church and state, say those who study the movement. One of the most popular beliefs among White Christian nationalists is that the US was founded as a Christian nation; the Founding Fathers were all orthodox, evangelical Christians; and God has chosen the US for a special role in history. These beliefs are growing among Christians, according to a survey last year by the Barna Group, a company that conducts surveys about faith and culture for communities of faith and nonprofits. The group found that an \u201cincreasing number of American Christians believe strongly\u201d that the US is a Christian nation, has not oppressed minorities, and has been chosen by God to lead the world. But the notion that the US was founded as a Christian nation is bad history and bad theology, says Philip Gorski, a sociologist at Yale University and co-author of  \u201cThe Flag and the Cross: White Christian Nationalism and the Threat to American Democracy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a half truth, a mythological version of American history,\u201d Gorski says. Some Founding Fathers did view the founding of the nation through a Biblical lens, Gorski says. (Every state constitution contains a reference to God or the divine.) But many did not. And virtually none of them could be classified as evangelical Christians. They were a collection of atheists, Unitarians, Deists, and liberal Protestants and other denominations. The Constitution also says nothing about God, the Bible or the Ten Commandments, Gorski says. And saying the US was founded as a Christian nation ignores the fact that much of its initial wealth was derived from slave labor and land stolen from Native Americans, he says. For evidence that the United States was founded as a secular nation, look no further than the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli, an agreement the US negotiated with a country in present-day Libya to end the practice of pirates attacking American ships. It was ratified unanimously by a Senate still half-filled with signers of the Constitution and declared, \u201cthe Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on Christian religion.\u201d Does this mean that any White Christian who salutes the flag and says they love their country is a Christian nationalist? No, not at all, historians say. A White Christian who says they love America and its values and institutions is not the same thing as a White Christian nationalist, scholars say. Gorski also notes that many devout Black Americans have exhibited a form of patriotism that does not degenerate into Christian nationalism. Gorski points to examples of the 19th century abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, and the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Both were devout Christians who expressed admiration for America and its founding documents.  But their patriotism also meant that \u201cthey challenged the nation to live up to its highest principles, to become a place of freedom, equality, justice and inclusion,\u201d he says. The patriotism of White Christian nationalists, on the other hand, is a form of racial tribalism, Gorski says. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018My tribe. \u2018We [White people] were here first. This is our country, and we don\u2019t like people who are trying to change it or people who are different\u2019 form of nationalism,\u201d Gorski says. Videos from the January 6 attack show a chaotic, tear-gas-soaked scene at the Capitol that looked more like a medieval battle. Insurrectionists punched police officers, used flagpoles as spears and smashed officers\u2019 faces against doors while a mob chanted,  \u201cFight for Trump!\u201d The attack left five people dead and nearly 140 law enforcement officers injured. The incongruity of people carrying \u201cJesus Saves\u201d signs while joining a mob whose members are pummeling police officers leads to an obvious question: How can White Christian nationalists who claim to follow Jesus, the \u201cPrince of Peace\u201d who renounced violence in the Gospels, support a violent insurrection? That\u2019s because they follow a different Jesus than the one depicted in the Gospels, says Du Mez, who is also a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University \u2014 a Christian school \u2014 in Michigan. They follow the Jesus depicted in the Book of Revelation, the warrior with eyes like \u201cflames of fire\u201d and \u201ca robe dipped in blood\u201d who led the armies of heaven on white horses in a final, triumphant battle against the forces of the antichrist. White Christian nationalists have refashioned Jesus into a kick-butt savior who is willing to smite enemies to restore America to a Christian nation by force, if necessary, Du Mez and others say. While warlike language like putting on \u201cthe full armor of God\u201d has long been common in Christian sermons and hymns, it has largely been interpreted as metaphorical. But many White Christian nationalists take that language literally.   That was clear on January 6. Some insurrectionists wore caps emblazoned with \u201cGod, Guns, Trump\u201d and chanted that the blood of Jesus was washing Congress clean. One wrote \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on a set of gallows erected at the Capitol. \u201cThey want the warrior Christ who wields a bloody sword and defeats his enemies,\u201d says Du Mez. \u201cThey want to battle with that Jesus. That Jesus brings peace, but only after he slays his enemies.\u201d And that Jesus sanctions the use of righteous violence if a government opposes God, she says. \u201cIf you deem somebody in power to be working against the goals of a Christian America, then you should not submit to that authority and you should displace that authority,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause the stakes are so high, the ends justify the means.\u201d That ends-justify-the means approach is a key part of White Christian nationalism, says Du Mez. It\u2019s why so many rallied behind former President Trump on January 6. She says he embodies a \u201cmilitant White masculinity\u201d that condones callous displays of power and appeals to Christian nationalists. But with few exceptions, White Christian nationalists do not accept this \u201cmilitant masculinity\u201d when exhibited by Black, Middle Eastern and Latino men, Du Mez writes in \u201cJesus and John Wayne.\u201d Aggression by people of color \u201cis seen as a threat to the stability of home and nation,\u201d she writes. Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson echoed this double standard last year when he said on a radio talk show that he never really felt threatened by the mostly White mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6. \u201cNow, had \u2026 President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned,\u201d Johnson said. Johnson later elaborated, saying \u201cthere was nothing racial about my comments\u2013 nothing whatsoever.\u201d This embrace of a warrior Christ has shaped some White evangelicals\u2019 attitudes on issues ranging from political violence to gun safety laws. A survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute revealed that of all respondents, White evangelicals were the religious group most likely to agree with the statement, \u201ctrue American patriots might have to resort to violence in order to save the country.\u201d There are also some White Christian nationalists who believe the Second Amendment was handed down by God. Samuel Perry, co-author of \u201cTaking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States,\u201d wrote in a recent essay that among Americans surveyed who believe \u201cThe federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation,\u201d over two-thirds rejected the idea that the federal government should enact stricter gun laws.\u201d \u201cThe more you line up with Christian nationalism, the less likely you are to support gun control,\u201d wrote Perry. \u201cGuns are practically an element of worship in the church of white Christian nationalism.\u201d In the 2008 presidential election, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin introduced a new term to the political discourse. She talked about \u201cthe real America\u201d and the \u201cpro-America areas of this great nation.\u201d Since then, many conservative political candidates have used the term \u201creal Americans\u201d to draw contrasts between their supporters and their opposition. Such language has been co-opted into a worldview held by many White Christian nationalists: The nation is divided between \u201creal Americans\u201d and other citizens who don\u2019t deserve the same rights, experts on White Christian nationalism say. Gorski, author of \u201cThe Flag and the Cross,\u201d says he found in his research a strong correlation between White Christian nationalism and support for gerrymandering\u2014an electoral process where politicians manipulate district lines to favor one party or, some critics say, race over another. He found similar support among White Christian nationalists for the Electoral College, which gives disproportionate political power to many rural, largely White areas of the country. When White Christian nationalists claim an election was stolen, they are reflecting the belief that some votes don\u2019t count, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that we are the people, and our vote should count, and you\u2019re not the people, and\u2026 you don\u2019t really deserve to have a voice,\u201d Gorski says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the voting machines say, because we know that all real Americans voted for Donald Trump.\u201d Those who want the US to become a Christian nation face a huge obstacle: Most Americans don\u2019t subscribe to their vision of America. The mainstreaming of White Christian nationalism comes as a growing number of Americans are rejecting organized religion. For the first time in the US last year, membership in communities of worship fell below 50%. Belief in God is at an all-time low, according to a recent Gallup poll. Add to that the country\u2019s growing racial and religious diversity. People who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the census began in 1790, and the majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color. On the surface, White Christian nationalism should not be on the ascent in America. So White Christian nationalists look for salvation from two sources. One is the emboldened conservative majority on the US Supreme Court, where recent decisions overturning Roe vs. Wade and protecting school prayer offer them hope. Critics, on the other hand, say the high court is eroding the separation of church and state. Not all Christians who support the high court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade and its school prayer decision are White nationalists. For example, plenty of Roman Catholics of all races support racial justice yet also backed the overturning of Roe. But White Christian nationalists are inspired by those decisions because one of their central goals is to erase the separation of church and state in the US. A recent study concluded that five of the justices on the Supreme Court are the \u201cmost pro-religion since at least World War II,\u201d and that the six conservative justices are \u201call Christian, mostly Catholic,\u201d and \u201creligiously devout.\u201d While some Americans fear the dangers of one-party rule, others like Pamela Paul, a columnist, warn of the Supreme Court instituting one-religion rule. \u201cWith their brand of religious dogma losing its purchase, they\u2019re imposing it on the country themselves,\u201d she wrote in a recent New York Times editorial. Gorski, the historian, says White Christian nationalism represents a grave threat to democracy because it defines \u201cwe the people\u201d in a way that excludes many Americans. \u201cThe United States cannot be both a truly multiracial democracy \u2013 a people of people and a nation of nations \u2013 and a white Christian nation at the same time,\u201d Gorski wrote in \u201cThe Flag and the Cross.\u201d \u201cThis is why white Christian nationalism has become a serious threat to American democracy, perhaps the most serious threat it now faces.\u201d The other source of hope for White Christian nationalists is a former occupant of the White House. Their devotion to him is illustrated by one of most striking images from the January 6 insurrection: A sign depicting a Nordic-looking Jesus wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. If Trump returns to the presidency, some White Christian nationalists may interpret his political resurrection as divine intervention. His support among White evangelicals increased from 2016 to 2020. And what the men carrying wooden crosses among the Capitol mob couldn\u2019t achieve on January 6, they might yet accomplish in 2024.",

After playing a brief video clip of McMullin appearing on a CNN discussion panel, the ad shows three women watching a screen as McMullin\u2019s voice says, \u201cThe Republican base is racist. These bigots.\u201d During this supposed quote, McMullin\u2019s face appears on the screen only as he says the words \u201cis racist.\u201d One of the women watching McMullin then says, \u201cWhat Evan McMullin says \u2013 that doesn\u2019t feel kind. He\u2019s derogatory towards a huge group of people.\u201d But the woman was reacting to something McMullin didn\u2019t actually say. Facts First: McMullin did not utter the phrase \u201cthe Republican base is racist.\u201d The Club for Growth Action ad dishonestly edited McMullin\u2019s comments, deleting critical words to make his quote sound more inflammatory than it was. Here\u2019s what McMullin actually said in his CNN appearance, which occurred on the day a neo-Nazi murdered a woman who was protesting a White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia: \u201cNot all Republicans, of course, are racist; I was raised by Republicans who are not at all, and who welcome Americans of all backgrounds, and are not at all like this \u2013 but there is an element of the Republican base that is racist.\u201d McMullin\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cthese bigots,\u201d which came a bit later in his CNN remarks, was also a clear reference to a specific segment of the party base, not to the base as a whole. When one Salt Lake City television station stopped airing the attack ad because of a legal complaint about its contents \u2013 the McMullin campaign has sent a legal complaint to various stations that have aired the ad \u2013 the Club for Growth sent the station a replacement ad that was more accurate. McMullin ran for president in 2016 as an independent opposed to Donald Trump, earning more than 21 percent of the vote in Utah while coming third to Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. This CNN discussion happened on August 12, 2017, the day a neo-Nazi rammed his car into a group that was protesting a White nationalist event in Charottesville, killing paralegal Heather Heyer and injuring others. Trump, then the President, received widespread criticism for a statement that day in which he did not mention White nationalism and said instead, \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. On many sides, on many sides.\u201d After saying on CNN that some Republicans are not racist but that \u201can element\u201d of the base is racist, McMullin added: \u201cAnd our leaders are afraid to stand up to them, because if they do \u2013 if they do so \u2013 they\u2019ll be criticized and they\u2019ll potentially lose votes. And so they don\u2019t do it. But that\u2019s not public service, that\u2019s self-service. And we need leaders, especially on the Republican and conservative side these days, who will serve the country. And serving the country means standing up to these bigots.\u201d So: McMullin said \u201cthese bigots\u201d 67 words after he said \u201can element\u201d of the Republican base is racist. The Club for Growth Action ad has McMullin saying \u201cthese bigots\u201d immediately after supposedly declaring the entire Republican base racist. That\u2019s a big difference. A lawyer for McMullin\u2019s campaign sent a letter to Utah television stations calling the ad \u201cdeceptive and defamatory\u201d and demanding that they stop running it. At least one station, KSL of Salt Lake City, has agreed to do so; the station is instead running the replacement ad, which omits the \u201cthese bigots\u201d comment and quotes McMullin as saying \u201can element of the Republican base is racist\u201d rather than just \u201cthe Republican base is racist.\u201d (The replacement ad still changes McMullin\u2019s grammar a bit, and it leaves out McMullin\u2019s preceding comments about the existence of welcoming and non-racist Republicans, but we say the revised version is fair game.) This is not the first time during the midterm election that a Club for Growth Action attack ad has deceptively edited someone\u2019s remarks. In December 2021, CNN fact-checked the group\u2019s slice-and-dice job against a candidate running in a Republican Senate primary in North Carolina. The Club for Growth Action did not respond Monday to a request for comment from CNN.",

            "article_content": "Trumpism is on trial this week. Steve Bannon, a founding father of Donald Trump\u2019s wrecking ball anti-elite movement, has his day in court starting on Monday on charges of contempt of Congress after he snubbed the House committee investigating January 6, 2021. The ex-President\u2019s dereliction of duty that fateful day, meanwhile, will be under minute-by-minute scrutiny in a primetime hearing Thursday focusing on how he did nothing as the violent mob he incited invaded the US Capitol. These two moments of public accounting will exemplify the committee\u2019s success in ensuring that Trump\u2019s lifelong aura of impunity does not prevent the emergence of what really happened during the worst attack on American democracy in modern times. But they also come as Trump\u2019s forces are gathering for a new attack on the truth as they seek to launch the ex-President on a path back to power that would portend even more authoritarian upheaval than his previous term. House Republicans, eying the majority in November\u2019s midterms, are already drawing up plans to investigate and intimidate key members of the January 6 panel and hold hearings designed to sow falsehoods about Trump\u2019s true responsibility for events on that day, according to new CNN reporting. This preview of how a potential GOP House majority would act as a weapon for the ex-President comes as pro-Trump candidates in states like Arizona and Pennsylvania seek to weaken democratic guardrails in state and localities ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. And the twice-impeached ex-President, who tried to steal the 2020 election and launched a coup attempt when it did not go his way, said in an interview with New York Magazine that it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, he launches his 2024 campaign. This confluence of events underscores how extremist political forces that rocked the United States during Trump\u2019s term are not extinguished even as shocking new details emerge of his behavior when democracy was on the brink. It also shows that even now, it\u2019s not certain that the truth about 2020 will win out and suggests a possible second act for the Trump-Bannon insurgency. These new fronts in the battle between accountability and efforts to whitewash the true story of January 6 coincide with a flurry of developments in the investigation, including a growing storm over whether the Secret Service deleted text messages about one of the most notorious days in US history. The committee, meanwhile, appears to have corroborated key details of a wild scene in the presidential SUV that day when Trump demanded to be taken to Capitol Hill. The committee says it is determined that the former President\u2019s new political maneuverings and the attempts of House Republicans to taint them will not prevent it from getting the facts out even if it is already clear that many pro-Trump voters do not wish to learn the truth or would not let it affect their votes. The January 6 insurrection: Minute-by-minute \u201cThe bottom line is that no one is above the law, whether he\u2019s a President, a former President or a potential future presidential candidate,\u201d Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, one of the leaders of Thursday\u2019s hearing, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cWe are going to pursue the facts and analyze those, provide recommendations, and, if necessary, pass that information along to other people who would act in an appropriate way to hold him accountable,\u201d the Virginia Democrat said. If there is an intellectual guru of Trumpism, it\u2019s Bannon. The former investment banker was quick to spot the appeal of Trump\u2019s populist economic nationalism. Trump\u2019s chaos and governing incompetence played directly into his desire to see Washington elite power structures and systems of regulations, taxes, alliances and trade pacts implode \u2013 what he called the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d Bannon was a key influence early in the Trump White House when he served as a West Wing adviser. Like many in Trump\u2019s orbit, his relationship with the then-President frayed in the bear pit of competing power cliques in the White House and he left. But also like many ex-Trump associates, he retained Trump\u2019s ear. Bannon spoke to Trump a number of times before and after January 6, according to media reports and White House call logs. Authors Bob Woodward and Robert Costa wrote in their book \u201cPeril\u201d that Bannon urged Trump to focus on January 6 as a last stand for his attempt to overthrow the 2020 election based on false claims of voter fraud. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bury Biden on January 6th, f**king bury him,\u2019\u201d Bannon told Trump over the phone, according to the book. Last week, the House select committee revealed in a hearing that when Bannon predicted on January 5, 2021, that \u201call hell\u201d would break loose the next day, he did so after speaking to Trump. On his \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, Bannon, who was pardoned by the ex-President when he was facing federal fraud charges, has sought to perpetuate Trumpism, exhorting the ex-President\u2019s supporters to take over local Republican parties in precincts and to run for office in school boards and local jurisdictions to trigger the next \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d revolution from the bottom up. But on Monday, Bannon goes on trial in federal court in Washington, DC, on charges of failing to testify and turn over documents to the House select committee. He has pleaded not guilty. The run-up to the case \u2013 a rare trial on the question of contempt of Congress \u2013 has been dominated by arguments over his 11th-hour offer to talk to the committee, preferably publicly, and confusion over whether Trump had waived executive privilege for his former adviser or had ever invoked it. Bannon had long left the White House by the time of the Capitol insurrection so it was hard to see how a doctrine seen as protecting the right of presidents to get advice from government advisers could apply to him. But it\u2019s long been obvious that Bannon has seen the case as a wider political platform and a chance to take a stand for Trumpism, to cause a disorientating media storm and to turn the legal system into the kind of knots his patron caused in the political sphere. He live streamed his arrival at an FBI field office to turn himself in. And he later vowed, \u201cWe\u2019re taking down the Biden regime.\u201d The judge has not yet said whether he will admit as evidence Bannon\u2019s offer as evidence to the jury his offer to talk the committee, but has dealt him a series of procedural blows in the run-up to the trial that have raised questions about the viability of his defense. The committee hearing on Thursday will lay out what Luria said was a \u201cminute by minute\u201d recreation of the 187 minutes while the insurrection was raging and Trump failed to stop it. And while the televised hearing is the last one in the series, she said Americans would be hearing from the committee again in hearings or in other forms when it eventually produces its findings. The committee has no power to lay charges. But it has taken a prosecutorial tone with its televised and highly produced presentations laying out all aspects of Trump\u2019s behavior after the 2020 election. It has made a case that Trump knew he lost the election fair and square but that he escalated his lies about fraud anyway. He pressured local election officials in states like Georgia and Arizona to overturn Biden\u2019s victories. Then, when that failed, the panel said he welcomed extraordinary and unconstitutional schemes by conservative lawyers and extremist supporters to try to force then-Vice President Mike Pence to hand him the election in Congress. The committee alleged in recent hearings that Trump knew some of his supporters were armed but incited them to march up to the Capitol anyway, and thought Pence deserved it when rioters called for him to be hanged, according to witness testimony. January 6 committee members expect panel to receive Secret Service texts by Tuesday One of the key issues before the committee this week concerns Secret Service texts subpoenaed by the panel from January 5, and January 6, 2021, which two committee members said they expect to receive by Tuesday. According to a letter sent to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Inspector General, which was first obtained by CNN, the texts were erased as part of a device replacement program after the watchdog had requested electronic records. The question of whether the messages can be recovered has not yet been publicly answered. The texts have taken on extra importance since former West Wing aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified about how Trump had been irate when his security detail refused to take him to the Capitol on January 6. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the leaders of Thursday\u2019s hearing, expressed disbelief that the messages could have been erased. \u201cIn the very least, it is quite crazy that the Secret Service would actually end up deleting anything related to one of the more infamous days in American history, particularly when it comes to the role of the Secret Service,\u201d he told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the committee and one of the few House Republicans to turn against Trump, may find that he is the one being scrutinized if his party wins back the chamber in the midterm elections. The Illinois Republican is not running for reelection. But CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr, Melanie Zanona and Zachary Cohen reported Friday that GOP leaders are plotting revenge on the select committee. Kinzinger and committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, could even be subpoenaed to testify, according to CNN\u2019s reporting. The glimpse at a possible future Republican majority shows that for all the attempts to hold the former President to account, one principle of Trumpism \u2013 using government power to punish his enemies \u2013 is undiminished.",

            "article_content": "On Friday morning, former Trump White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was asked by CNN\u2019s John Berman whether he wanted Donald Trump to run for president again in 2024. Mulvaney said he did not: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks that Republicans can vote for that get the same policies and the same sort of willingness to stand up and fight for the middle class that Donald Trump had without the baggage. \u201cI think you get a lot of the benefits without a lot of the drawbacks. \u2026 I think that\u2019s where a lot of Republicans are as a direct result of these [January 6] hearings.\u201d The argument Mulvaney is effectively making is if Republicans can get someone \u2013 like, say, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2013 who is 90% of Trump (since no one is 100% Trump other than Trump), they should jump at that chance. Because, well, 100% Trump comes with all sorts of built-in negatives \u2013 most notably that he lost a bid for a second term less than two years ago and has spent the time between then and now pursuing demonstrably false claims that the election was stolen from him. Mulvaney\u2019s logic is, in short, right. Trumpism \u2013 over-the-top nationalism, a rejection of \u201cwoke\u201d culture etc. \u2013 is more popular within the Republican Party than is Trump himself. So, in theory, if you decouple Trumpism from Trump, you may well have a winner. A New York Times/Siena College poll released earlier this week suggests that there is at least some bloc of support for Mulvaney\u2019s view. Nearly half of those who said they planned to vote in the 2024 Republican presidential primary wanted someone other than Trump to be the party\u2019s nominee. Which is interesting! As is this, from the Times, in regards to a 2024 general election matchup that put President Joe Biden at 44% and Trump at 41%: \u201cA growing anyone-but-Trump vote inside the party contributed to Mr. Trump\u2019s deficit, with 16 percent of Republicans saying that if he were the nominee they would support Mr. Biden, would back a third-party candidate, wouldn\u2019t vote at all or remained unsure what they would do.\u201d On the other hand, that same poll showed Trump leading DeSantis 49% to 25% in a hypothetical 2024 Republican primary. The key questions here are as follows: 1) Just how big, really, is the group of Republicans who will vote for any Trump-y alternative to Trump? When it comes down to Trump vs. a non-Trump, do those who say they want someone other than him as the nominee stick by that belief? 2) How credible a challenge does Trump wind up drawing in the 2024 race?\u00a0 No one has yet announced, and while Republicans like DeSantis are clearly moving in that direction, that\u2019s not the same thing as actually running. The Point: If Republicans were looking clinically at who they should nominate for president in 2024, they would almost certainly settle on someone other than Trump. But nomination fights don\u2019t happen in a theoretical space. And in the real-world Trump remains the favorite.",

            "article_content": "New election. Same lies. Ex-President Donald Trump is injecting his democracy-damaging fraud claims into a new election cycle, urging his friend Mehmet Oz to simply declare he won a too-close-to-call race for the Republican Senate nomination in Pennsylvania \u2013 a key state in Trump\u2019s desperate bid to steal the 2020 election. The cliffhanger contest between Oz and David McCormick, another claimant to Trump\u2019s legacy, is the marquee race from Tuesday\u2019s round of primaries \u2013 and carries calamitous echoes of 2020 election controversy and ill omens for 2024. As does the runaway victor in the commonwealth\u2019s GOP gubernatorial primary \u2013 state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who ran a campaign rooted in Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the last presidential election being stolen and who could oversee the 2024 White House race in the state if he wins in November. In a state that could be pivotal to control of the US Senate, top Republicans are raising concerns that Mastriano could drag the party\u2019s Senate nominee down, while Democratic nominee Josh Shapiro is already shaping the race by warning the state could fall into the clutches of a dangerous extremist. Trump is barging into the Senate race in Pennsylvania because there\u2019s still a chance that Oz, whom he endorsed last month, could lose out to the candidate the ex-President spurned, former hedge fund executive McCormick, when all votes are counted. He\u2019s frustrated that Oz is having to wait for counts of absentee ballots and delayed votes counted in person. Those votes are just as valid as any cast in person. But Trump is running the same corrupt playbook that he used nearly two years ago to falsely claim he won a second term. Trump encourages Oz to declare victory in too-close-to-call Pennsylvania Senate race \u201cDr. Oz should declare victory. It makes it much harder for them to cheat with the ballots that they just happened to find,\u201d Trump wrote on his ironically named social media network, \u201cTruth Social,\u201d on Wednesday. The ex-President claimed the Keystone State\u2019s election was a \u201cMESS,\u201d making the same kind of baseless claims he conjured after losing to President Joe Biden. Americans keen to move on from the former President might wonder why it matters what Trump wrote on a social media platform with a far smaller reach than Twitter, from which he was banned after the January 6, 2021, insurrection for inciting violence. But Trump\u2019s pressure on Oz, who late Wednesday had a lead of less than 1,300 votes among 1.3 million cast, represents a fresh attempt to stain the integrity of American democracy simply because it is not delivering the result he wants. If the former President was settled into his retirement on the fairways and greens of Florida, his dive into the Pennsylvania election wouldn\u2019t be so consequential. But there is every sign Trump means to be a major player in November\u2019s midterm elections as a launch pad for an attempt to win the White House back in 2024. He\u2019s proving that despite leaving Washington in disgrace after launching a campaign of lies designed to overturn his election loss, which resulted in an insurrection, he would have no qualms about doing so again. Trump has shown his power over his followers ever since 2020: his fraud falsehoods are now believed by millions, while many GOP candidates this year have made them a part of their campaign messaging. But this new example of interference in Pennsylvania is not history \u2013 it\u2019s an active effort to delegitimize an election. And if Oz loses, it could seriously delegitimize McCormick\u2019s victory among hard-core pro-Trump voters. Wait, so this Pennsylvania election wasn't fraudulent? Trump\u2019s mendacity places intense pressure on Oz and McCormick to end their race with grace and for the loser to accept the result \u2013 as candidates have done in America for nearly 250 years \u2013 in order to preserve faith in US elections. Whoever comes out on top, a recount could be automatically triggered if the margin is narrow enough. Oz has not, so far, taken Trump\u2019s advice and claimed victory, seeming to trust the election system in a state that the ex-President claimed was corrupt two years ago. Aides to McCormick, who has previously raised doubts about electoral integrity in the state, argue that uncounted absentee ballots \u2013 the very outstanding votes that Trump falsely claimed in 2020 were proof of fraud \u2013 will put him over the top. Another Pennsylvania Republican candidate who suddenly has no problem with Pennsylvania\u2019s election system is Mastriano. A cynic might conclude that this is because it delivered him a handsome victory. But his win in the gubernatorial primary means that an outright election denier from 2020 is now one step from power in one of the nation\u2019s most closely fought swing states. Mastriano is on record saying that the 2020 vote was compromised and the state legislature had the authority to appoint a new slate of electors, in defiance of voters, to send to Washington. So his victory is already ringing alarm bells in Washington. Republicans warn Trump-backed Mastriano over false election claims and eye impact on Senate race Add to that the fact that as governor, Mastriano would have the authority to appoint a secretary of state who would run the commonwealth\u2019s election in 2024. Mastriano also won a late endorsement from Trump, who may be on the ballot in the next presidential election. This confluence of threats to the state\u2019s democracy prompted Shapiro, the state\u2019s current attorney general and his opponent in the fall, to label Mastriano a \u201cdangerous extremist.\u201d And some GOP senators in Washington, salivating at the chance to win back their chamber in November, are worried. \u201cI don\u2019t think 2020 is what people are going to want to think about,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Wednesday. The reaction from GOP Senate Whip John Thune was a considerable understatement. The South Dakota Republican said that some of Mastriano\u2019s statements \u201caren\u2019t ideal.\u201d The fear among Republicans is that Mastriano is so radical, he could not just emulate Trump in trashing Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral system. He could also lose badly statewide by tanking among suburban moderate voters, just like Trump did. He might also stigmatize the eventual GOP Senate nominee in a seat that could decide the destiny of the chamber. Thune is banking on that not happening. \u201cI think people hopefully are, when it comes to the fall election, are very discerning and will be able to differentiate candidate for governor from the candidate for Senate,\u201d he told Raju. For Trump, however, the calculation is simple. He backs candidates who strongly support him \u2013 and who paid the price for his endorsement by amplifying his lies about election fraud. However, Tuesday\u2019s election results, like other primaries this year, contained a lesson for the former President, if he were minded to learn it. Whether he endorsed them or not, candidates were almost all running on Trumpism \u2013 the \u201cAmerica First\u201d populist nationalism that now dominates the Republican Party\u2019s grassroots. If Trump forgot 2020 and concentrated on that message \u2013 and worked exclusively to highlight President Joe Biden\u2019s vulnerabilities, including the raging inflation and high gas prices that helped send Wall Street into a 1,000-point plunge on Wednesday \u2013 he might significantly boost his hopes of a new White House term. But that would require him to do something unthinkable: Admit he lost.",

            "article_content": "Less than 48 hours after a deadly shooting by a White nationalist in Buffalo, New York, Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney minced no words in her assessment of where blame lies. \u201cThe House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism,\u201d tweeted Cheney on Monday morning. \u201cHistory has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. @GOP leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them.\u201d Which is, well, pretty damning. But, is it right? That question doesn\u2019t have an easy answer but there is some evidence to suggest that House GOP leaders \u2013 of which Cheney was one before being ousted last year for her willingness to criticize former President Donald Trump \u2013 have, at a minimum, been willing to look the other way as some of their rank and file have flirted with major figures in the white nationalist movement. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! In February, Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona addressed a conference organized by Nick Fuentes, a prominent White nationalist. (For Gosar, it was the latest in a series of episodes linking him to White nationalist leaders and rhetoric.) While some Republicans \u2013 most notably Utah Sen. Mitt Romney \u2013 blasted Greene and Gosar for their attendance, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was largely mum. This exchange, in early March, between the California Republican and Capitol Hill reporters on that topic is telling: Reporter: Any update on your conversations with Congressman Gosar and Greene? McCarthy: Yes, I\u2019ve talked to Greene. I\u2019m still waiting to talk to Gosar. Reporter: And? McCarthy: I\u2019ve talked to them. Reporter: But I think you told Jake and Manu [Raju] there\u2019s no place for that? McCarthy: There isn\u2019t no place for that. There\u2019s no place for what has gone on with that organization by far, and there never will be in this party, and it\u2019ll never be tolerated. Reporter: Will she go again? McCarthy: No, she will not go again. Reporter: Any repercussions for her? McCarthy: Look, my conversations with my members are exactly that, and I appreciate you asking. \u2026 They have the ability to be able to get committees based upon that time when it comes. Which, well, yeah. Over the weekend, Illinois Republican Rep. Adam, Kinzinger suggested that New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the number three Republican in House leadership who replaced Cheney last year, pushed \u201cwhite replacement theory\u201d \u2013 the idea that White people are being purposely replaced in America by minorities. Kinzinger was referencing Facebook ads paid for by Stefanik\u2019s campaign that used language echoing replacement theory. \u201cRadical Democrats are planning their most aggressive move yet: a PERMANENT ELECTION INSURRECTION,\u201d read the text of the ad, with an image of migrants crossing the border reflected in President Joe Biden\u2019s sunglasses. In a statement released Monday morning, Alex DeGrasse, a senior adviser to Stefanik, said that \u201cany implication or attempt to blame the heinous shooting in Buffalo on the Congresswoman is a disgusting new low for the Left, their Never Trump allies and their sycophant stenographers in the media.\u201d Which, well, OK. Here\u2019s the thing: When you don\u2019t condemn and punish members of your own party when they flirt with White nationalists and White nationalist ideology, you open the door for it to happen more often. That fact doesn\u2019t mean that the likes of McCarthy or Stefanik bear direct blame for what happened in Buffalo over the weekend. But, there is no question that Republican leaders have allowed intolerance \u2013 and noxious notions like White replacement theory \u2013 to fester within a part of their ranks over the past few years. And, as Cheney rightly notes, those actions \u2013 or, more accurately, that inaction \u2013 have consequences.",

            "article_content": "This weekend\u2019s massacre in Buffalo is the most terrifying proof yet of a grave threat from a wave of White supremacist terrorism \u2013 a seething, hateful ideology that festers online and is adding a new layer of fear to a dangerous, divisive age. The killing of 10 innocent people at a grocery store, allegedly targeted in a largely Black neighborhood by an 18-year-old apparently steeped in the racist White replacement theory, is horrific enough as one of America\u2019s all too common mass gun rampages, of which there were several this weekend alone. But details emerging about the depraved racial motivations of the Buffalo suspect are the latest sign that the country\u2019s poisoned politics are not just unable to prevent such evil and the seemingly endless carnage caused by gun violence. They are actively making the situation worse, creating an atmosphere in which Black Americans were gunned down while doing their Saturday shopping. 'Replacement' conspiracies driving gunmen creep into mainstream politics More than half a century since the greatest gains of the civil rights movement and nearly a decade and a half since the election of the first Black President, a growing roster of killings motivated by racial rage \u2013 not just against Black Americans but against Jews and Hispanics as well \u2013 appears to augur a frightening new passage of history in a nation that is internally estranged. This reality set off a day of agony and mourning in Buffalo and in minority communities nationwide on Sunday. \u201cSomeone drove from hundreds of miles away, someone not from this community, that did not know this community, that came here to take as many Black lives as possible, who did this in a willful, premeditated fashion,\u201d Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d There will be claims that the Buffalo shooting was an isolated incident perpetrated by a sick extremist. But it is becoming harder to make such arguments. The 2015 massacre of worshippers at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, the 2018 mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, and the 2019 killings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, were all also motivated by racial hate. These contemporary trends, which confirm years of FBI warnings that White supremacist terrorism is America\u2019s chief domestic threat, also pose deep questions. A 'hero' security guard, a former fire official's mother and a teacher were among the 10 people killed at a Buffalo grocery store For instance, what level of culpability is there for conservative media networks that advance inflammatory material in primetime like the \u201cGreat Replacement Theory,\u201d which alleges that there is an organized plot to replace White Americans with Black, Hispanic and Jewish voters? That line of racial subversion appears to have influenced Buffalo suspect Payton Gendron, according to police and a copy of what appears to be his 180-page manifesto, which was obtained by CNN. In the document, attributed to Gendron, he talks about his perception of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites. An official familiar with the investigation said Gendron, who is charged with first degree murder, made statements that were filled with hate toward the Black community after his arrest. Investigators also uncovered other information from search warrants and other methods indicating the alleged shooter was \u201cstudying\u201d previous hate attacks and shootings. While there is no evidence so far that the shooter in Buffalo had a partisan motive, the attack came at a time when racial demagoguery and equivocation about White extremism have seeped into politics, fostered by politicians such as ex-President Donald Trump. Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican and fierce Trump critic, candidly blamed her own party on Monday morning for engendering the conditions that give rise to such tragedies. \u201cThe House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. @GOP leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them,\u201d Cheney tweeted. And the massacre again plunges social media companies, on whose networks such hate sometimes percolates, into a fierce controversy over the extent to which free speech should be regulated to avoid promoting extremist ideology that kills. \u201cThis spreads like a virus. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the CEOs of all the social media platforms to examine their policies and to be able to look me in the eye and tell me that everything is being done that they can to make sure that this information is not spread,\u201d New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. NY governor calls on social media companies to police platforms \u201cThey have to be able to identify when information like this \u2013 the second it hits the platform, it needs to be taken down, because this is spreading like wildfire. These theories that result in the radicalization of a young person sitting in their house is deeply scary and something that has to be dealt with.\u201d The Buffalo shooting also triggered the familiar and futile ritual of politicians offering prayers for the victims, accompanied by Democratic demands for gun control and Republican obfuscating on the issue of whether guns like the one used in Saturday\u2019s attack should be legal. Nothing that has happened since the gunman burst into the supermarket suggests that moderate, limited reforms to firearms law have any chance of getting around the GOP logjam caused by the Senate filibuster. Some Democrats might also rather not vote on gun control measures in a midterm election year. So there is every reason to believe that Buffalo will join other cities whose names become emblems for the country\u2019s unwillingness to come to agreement on how to prevent mass shootings. While the Buffalo attack was the most horrific outburst of gun violence this weekend, it was far from the only such bloodshed. Multiple people were shot in a church in Orange County, California. Up to 20 people were shot just hours apart in several outbursts of gunfire in Milwaukee on Friday night near an NBA Playoffs game. In Chicago on Saturday evening, a 16-year-old was shot and killed near \u201cThe Bean\u201d public art display in Millennium Park. America is hurting in more ways than one, and it\u2019s likely the horror in Buffalo will exacerbate feelings of insecurity \u2013 in all its forms \u2013 that many Americans are experiencing. Parents cannot find baby formula. High inflation, which has led to soaring food prices and almost daily records set for the cost of a gallon of gas, is making life miserable for millions of Americans. It has also confounded the White House\u2019s initial diagnosis that the high cost of living was a \u201ctransitory\u201d result of the pandemic and most of its efforts to ease the pressure. Investigators and reporters study purported manifesto after Buffalo shooting spree More than two years of successive waves of Covid-19 have killed one million people in the US, left many more exhausted and tore new political divides over vaccines and masking in a nation that seems to be splitting into conservative and liberal tribes. And the scars of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol are felt in this year\u2019s midterm elections, as candidates up and down the Republican ticket whitewash what happened that day while repeating Trump\u2019s lies about a stolen election. The current tempestuous political mood might be the rule rather than the exception, but the acrimony and division is about to get even worse when the Supreme Court is expected to hand down a major abortion ruling in the next few weeks. Nationwide abortion rights marches this weekend, in response to the draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade, underscored how the country is on the cusp of another major battle. If the final ruling does gut the nationwide right to an abortion and the issue is sent back to the states, the cultural divisions between red and blue states and cities and rural areas will ensure it\u2019s a fight that rages for decades. The existential feud between liberal and conservative visions of the country is taking place in a febrile atmosphere deliberately fomented by Trump for his own political gain. The ex-President\u2019s lies about election fraud and his attempted coup to stay in power have poisoned the political process and made this moment in history even more fragile. His likely 2024 presidential campaign could stretch the country even closer to a breaking point \u2013 and further strain racial and social cohesion. President Joe Biden, who was motivated to run in part by disgust at Trump\u2019s blaming of \u201cboth sides\u201d for violence at White supremacists\u2019 2017 march in Charlottesville, Virginia, condemned the motivations behind the attack in Buffalo. \u201cWe must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America. Our hearts are heavy once again, but our resolve must never waver,\u201d the President said at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service on Sunday. Biden and first lady Jill Biden plan to travel to Buffalo to meet the families of victims of the shooting on Tuesday, a White House official said. The visit will likely stir memories of then-President Barack Obama\u2019s moving visit to Charleston, when he broke into \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d during a eulogy for Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the 2015 massacre. Biden does not share Obama\u2019s eloquence or historic significance as a barrier breaker. And seven years on, amidst the political convulsions that have occurred since, he faces an even tougher task in leading a fractured nation toward common ground.",

            "article_content": "The vicious epicenter of the war in Ukraine now rests in the scorched cities of the east and the south. But the conflict\u2019s reverberations are widening in a way that will leave few people on Earth \u2013 from small-town America to poverty-stricken Africa \u2013 untouched. Many wars, from World War I to the conflict in Iraq, at first seem certain to end quickly with a short, violent shock. But often they confound such predictions, degenerating into protracted slogs with domino effects that cause distant and far-reaching political, economic and humanitarian effects. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine is following this pattern. After starting with predictions of a blitzkrieg to seize Kyiv two months ago, the war is set to drag on for weeks and months, if not longer. How Transnistria, a Russian-backed region in Moldova, is getting pulled into the war in Ukraine The consequences of a war that last even that long are grave. Given Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s vicious assault on civilians it will mean many more Ukrainian dead and almost inevitably more atrocities and war crimes. There will be an ever present danger of the war spilling over and causing a wider conflagration \u2013 both militarily and in a growing showdown over Russia\u2019s energy exports, which Europe badly needs. Any time two nuclear powers as large as Russia and the US are locked in even an indirect conflict, as is the case given Washington\u2019s massive injection of arms into Ukraine, the possibility of a direct confrontation remains. And a longer war means more uncertainty for Western leaders. Global food insecurity is likely to worsen from a ruined Ukrainian harvest, potentially adding to destabilization and unrest around the world. In the US, it will also cost people already struggling with inflation, soaring grocery bills and ballooning costs of filling up their gas tanks, which could spell huge political problems for President Joe Biden in a midterm election year.\u2019 Russia shifts tactics, steps up pace of assault in Ukraine's east and south There is one core reason why the war will drag on. The strategic picture in Ukraine, with the country far from defeat and the invader not yet vanquished, means neither side has a burning incentive to pursue urgent diplomacy to end the war. Ukraine has no trust for Putin following his unprovoked invasion, which was meant to crush its independence and national identity, and the carnage he has visited on the country. The heroism of its citizen army and the accelerating flow of offensive western arms is encouraging hopes of victory in Kyiv. Russia's tanks in Ukraine have a 'jack-in-the-box' design flaw. And the West has known about it since the Gulf war Putin, meanwhile, has not yet achieved any of his goals after a humiliating pull back from the outskirts of Kyiv. Despite reported heavy losses of men and materiel, his generals have laid out new war aims for their troops to grind out \u2013 the seizure of the entire southern Ukrainian coast \u2013 to strangle the country by cutting off its access to the Black Sea. The United States has recognized these developments with a shift in strategy laid out this week that seeks to use an effective proxy war to weaken Russia so severely it can no longer threaten Europe. But Ukraine fears a widening of the battlefield. Officials warned Wednesday of a possible new front in the south-west along the Moldovan border, involving the pro-Russian enclave of Transnistria. And the threat of a full-blown energy war that could trigger a recession and severe hardship in Europe \u2013 and knock-on effects in the US \u2013 became more likely Wednesday when Russia cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, two NATO members that were once in the Soviet Union\u2019s orbit. The primary result of a longer war \u2013 one that has already featured some of the worst atrocities in Europe since the Nazi era \u2013 will tragically mean many more Ukrainians will be killed or forced from their homes. But the deprivation and threat to life will not be contained within the country\u2019s borders. Indications that war will go on for months will worsen increasingly dire economic shock waves. The World Bank, for instance, warned on Wednesday that the conflict had already caused the worst spike in commodity prices in 50 years. In the US, this means more expensive grocery bills for Americans \u2013 and deeper political headaches for Biden. But it\u2019s worse in the developing world. Rising grain prices in nations afflicted by poverty and already poor nutrition are a life-and-death issue for millions of people. Higher food and energy prices could last 'for years,' World Bank warns Fast-moving indications of a widening footprint of the Ukrainian war on Wednesday coincided with more nuclear saber rattling by Putin, who warned that Russian foes who interfered in Ukraine would face a heavy price. \u201cWe have all the tools for this. Ones that no one can brag about. And we won\u2019t brag. We will use them if needed,\u201d Putin said. The frightening rhetoric may be a sign Russia is feeling pressure because its goals for the invasion have so far fallen short of its expectations. But his words are a worrying reminder of the constant danger of an escalation of the conflict, especially since the US is testing Russia\u2019s red lines with its gusher of weapons systems flowing into Ukraine. In Washington and Moscow, there is now a common acknowledgment that this war is about far more than Ukraine, and may be the opening engagement in a prolonged and wider geopolitical struggle. \u201cIf Russia gets away with this cost-free, then so goes the so-called international order, and if that happens, then we\u2019re entering into an era of seriously increased instability,\u201d Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told CNN Tuesday. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss warned the world must be prepared for \u201cthe long haul\u201d against Putin, whom she described as \u201ca desperate rogue operator.\u201d She argued the West should not just arm Ukraine but nations in the western Balkans, Moldova and Georgia to counter the Russian threat \u2013 prompting Moscow to warn that outsiders should not \u201cpump up\u201d those countries with weapons. \u201cGeopolitics is back,\u201d Truss said in a speech in London. \u201cAfter the Cold War we thought peace, stability and prosperity would spread inexorably around the globe. \u2026 We were wrong.\u201d Russia\u2019s top brass also appreciates the wider dimensions of a conflict that has destroyed the certainties of the post-Cold War world, and turned their country into an international pariah. \u201cNow, we are at war with the whole world,\u201d said top Russian Gen. Rustam Minnekaev in comments cited by the Financial Times and the B.Z. newspaper in Berlin. Assuming that Biden succeeds in his primary aim of preventing a disastrous direct conflict between the two most heavily nuclear-armed superpowers, the impact in the US of a longer war in Ukraine will be mainly economic and political. It will profoundly touch the lives of Americans \u2013 and Biden\u2019s own political prospects, not just in a midterm election year projected to bring heavy losses for Democrats but also in the run-up to his possible 2024 reelection race. Inside the months-long effort to free Trevor Reed from detention in Russia The World Bank\u2019s warning about commodity prices must have alarmed the White House and underscored the fact that Ukraine was about the worst place for a war to break out at a time of already high food and energy prices. That\u2019s because Russia, now facing crushing Western sanctions, is a major exporter of natural gas, oil and coal. Ukraine \u2013 the \u201cbreadbasket of Europe\u201d \u2013 is a key source of wheat and corn. The likely wholesale disruption of its harvest this year could be a disaster. With inflation already running at the highest levels since the 1980s, Biden is being accused of botching the economy, despite a strong overall recovery since the pandemic and historic job creation numbers. Another wave of rising food prices in the run-up to the midterms could doom Democratic congressional candidates. So far, Biden is trying a questionable strategy of blaming high inflation on the war, calling it \u201cPutin\u2019s price hike,\u201d even though high prices predated the invasion. Such nuance is unlikely to survive the brutal reality of the campaign trail, where Republicans are already leaning into a simple message about soaring grocery bills, which could render Democratic attempts to tie them to the extremism of ex-President Donald Trump less salient. The war could also hurt Biden beyond its economic impact. The President has united the Western alliance behind an effort to punish and isolate Putin, which has restored a reputation for foreign policy chops badly tarnished by the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year. But recent polls have suggested that the war is far from a political winner for the President, even as he\u2019s stayed good to his word to keep US soldiers out of the fight. When he beat Trump in 2020, no voter thought that they were signing up for a proxy war in Europe with Russia, far less a rerun of the Cold War and blood curdling nuclear rhetoric that may endure at least as long as Putin is in office. It's not just Latinos and younger voters. Democrats are slipping among Black voters too. The shocking turn of events in Europe is a reminder that the best laid plans of Presidents always get overturned \u2013 and of how Biden\u2019s administration has been hostage to events beyond its control. But it\u2019s questionable how long the attention of US voters will remain on the war in Ukraine given the struggles many are facing at home. If the visibility of the war fades as it degenerates into a protracted attritional conflict, Biden\u2019s efforts to pin the blame on Putin for its economic blowback will get harder. And a President with a 41% approval rating, according to the latest CNN average of recent national polls, will be vulnerable to another broad GOP charge heading into the midterms \u2013 that he\u2019s fumbling while the world burns. Prolonged high inflation, a sense of economic malaise, and a backdrop of global chaos would also seed fertile ground for the demagogic, populist nationalism of Trump as he gears up for a possible 2024 rematch with Biden.",

            "article_content": "Election Day is still over six months away in the US. But major general elections are already happening all over the world. Round one of France\u2019s presidential election occurred this past weekend, and the runoff will be held next weekend. We\u2019ll talk about that race in a moment, but we\u2019ll start stateside. Specifically, we\u2019re going out west to a state that may be ground zero for a Republican takeover in Congress in November. When people tick off the most competitive states on this year\u2019s Senate map, their selections would probably include states like Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Most race rating experts will also list Nevada, even if it is not top of mind. Indeed, none of the Democrats holding federal office in the Silver State should feel safe about their reelection prospects this year. This includes the three Democrats in the House and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. The incumbent Democratic governor, Steve Sisolak, faces a tough race as well. That might not be what you\u2019d expect in a state that has gone Democratic in the last four presidential elections, but there are troubling trends for the party underneath the surface. Now-President Joe Biden won the state by a little over 2 points in 2020. That was a slightly reduced margin from Hillary Clinton\u2019s in 2016, even though he did over 2 points better than she did nationally. Biden\u2019s margin in Nevada was 4 points and 10 points lower than Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 and 2008 showings. Biden backlash in Nevada raises Republicans' hopes of taking back Senate in 2022 In other words, Republicans have been closing the gap with Democrats in the last couple of presidential elections in Nevada. In 2020, the state voted more Republican than the nation as a whole for the first time since 2004. The shifting turf in the Silver State would have been almost unthinkable at the beginning of the 2010s. The state\u2019s growing Hispanic population reportedly helped power Democrats to a presidential win in 2008, after George W. Bush had won the state twice, and Harry Reid held on to his Senate seat by a shockingly comfortable margin in 2010. But two combining factors in national politics makes Nevada vulnerable to a Republican takeover. The first is what made Democrats so hopeful about the state in the first place: Hispanic voters. Hispanics made up more than 15% of the vote in three states decided by 5 points or less in the 2020 election, according to that year\u2019s exit polls: Arizona (19%), Florida (19%) and Nevada (17%). The problem for Democrats who rely on Hispanic voters is that then-President Donald Trump did better with Hispanics nationally in 2020 than any Republican since Bush in 2004. The trend among Hispanics away from the Democratic Party has continued during the Biden administration. Democrats' problem with Hispanic voters isn't going away as GOP gains seem to be solidifying The second is perhaps more surprising: White voters without a college degree. This bloc has trended heavily in the Republican direction over the last few election cycles. In some states, the movement has been counterbalanced by White voters with a college degree migrating toward the Democratic Party. White voters in Nevada, however, are disproportionately without a college degree. Only White voters in Wisconsin (65%) are more likely to lack a college degree than White voters in Nevada (64%) among the states that were decided by 5 points or less in the 2020 presidential election. Nevada was the only swing state that was in the top three when looking at the percentage of Hispanic voters and of White voters without a college degree. In a year shaping up to be a bad one for Democrats nationwide, it makes sense that Cortez Matso would be in big trouble against her likely Republican opponent, former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt. Likewise, it follows that Sisolak is endangered. Nevada Democrats potentially made their US House situation even worse, given how state lawmakers carved up the map in redistricting \u2013 a process Democrats had full control of. Biden carried the 3rd and 4th congressional districts by under 5 points in 2020. Both seats are a bit safer for Democrats under the new lines, though neither would have been won by Biden by more than 8 points. At the same time, the Las Vegas-area 1st District went from one Biden won by over 20 points to one that would have backed him by under 10 points. If 2022 turns out to be a nominally good Republican year, Democrats may hold on to all three House seats. If 2022 looks anything like the special state and federal elections so far in 2022 \u2013 with Republicans outperforming the Trump baseline by an average of 9 points \u2013 Democrats may not just lose the Senate race but all three House races in Nevada as well. Talk about a potential dummymander. Macron, the incumbent and a moderate, is facing off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in a repeat of the 2017 presidential runoff. Macron was up by 22 points in the final polls five years ago and went on to win by 32 points. This year, the polls suggest a far closer affair, thanks in large part to a problem familiar to the US President: inflation. In polls taken since the first round, Macron has been up by an average of 7 points over Le Pen. But a Le Pen victory cannot be ruled out. Why? Beyond the fact that there was a larger poll error (10 points) in 2017 than the current average margin, take a look at every presidential election in France from 1969. There have been nine in total, a relatively small sample size. How Marine Le Pen has changed since losing the 2017 presidential election The true margin of error, at a 95% confidence interval, is about +/- 13 points, if you were to take into account this small sample size and look at the difference between the final polling average and the result in those nine elections. That is, it\u2019s nearly double Macron\u2019s current polling advantage. The fact that the race is so close may astonish some given past elections in France. Le Pen\u2019s father, Jean-Marie, who shared fairly similar politics with his daughter, lost the 2002 runoff by over 60 points to Jacques Chirac. Marine Le Pen, herself, cut that deficit in half in 2017, though she wasn\u2019t anywhere close to winning. This year, Le Pen has been helped by the state of the French economy. The inflation rate this past month was higher than at any point since 1985. More French voters list inflation as the most important issue to their vote than they do any other. The state of the economy has allowed Le Pen to take advantage of the rising tide of nationalism that has been a growing political force in Europe and America. We\u2019ve seen it with Trump here in the States. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n was able to tighten his grip on power earlier this month, after his party gained seats in the parliamentary elections. Whether all of this is enough for Le Pen to pull off the win is a whole matter. It\u2019s certainly enough to make this race one that is too close to call. This weekend marks Easter and the beginning of the Passover holiday. In the last year before the coronavirus pandemic took hold (2019), Google searches for \u201cchurch\u201d reached a year high right around Easter. The White House finally gets to throw a party When it comes to Passover, more Jewish Americans told the Pew Research Center in 2020 that they had held or attended a Passover Seder (62%) than observed a life milestone ritual like a bar or bat mitzvah (61%), fasted for at least some of Yom Kippur (46%), went to synagogue at least monthly (20%) or kept kosher at home (17%). April 10 brief encounter: Last week, I noted baseball\u2019s declining popularity in the American landscape. The first prime-time Sunday night game of the year on ESPN pulled in 2.2 million viewers, which put it in third place for the evening on cable. The game was beaten out by an episode of \u201c90 Day Fianc\u00e9\u201d on TLC and a Hallmark Channel movie, which each scored 2.3 million watchers. Helping out two generations: According to a recent Pew Research Center report, Americans between the ages of 40 and 49 were the most likely, at 54%, to have both a parent 65 years old or older and a child who is either younger than 18 or relied on them for at least some financial support in the past year. In second place were those in the 50-59 age bracket at 36%. Joe Biden's numbers are collapsing among a group you really wouldn't expect The young turn against Biden: A new Gallup report showed that Biden\u2019s aggregated approval rating over the last seven months (September to March) among those born between 1997 and 2004 (Generation Z) has declined by 21 points, from 60% to 39%, compared with the first six months of his presidency. For comparison, it stayed the same among those born before 1946 at 48%.

            "article_content": "Last spring, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar and a small group of volunteers traveled to the southern border city of San Luis, Arizona, to clean up the city\u2019s trash. The small group included a blogger who has praised Nazi Germany; a Gosar-endorsed congressional candidate who would be removed from Twitter for calling for executing election officials; and a speaker removed from the 2020 Republican National Convention for sharing an antisemitic conspiracy theory describing an elaborate Jewish plan for global domination. Since 2018, when Gosar dined with a European extremist who called for banning Islam from Europe, the far-right Arizona lawmaker has boosted the profiles of local antisemites, attended a conference organized by a prominent White nationalist, and repeatedly shared content from a Holocaust denial website. Gosar is now facing scrutiny over his ties to extremists after speaking via video at a conference organized by White nationalist Nick Fuentes. Gosar spoke in person at the event last year. And both Gosar, and his colleague Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who spoke in person at the conference this year, have been condemned by Republican leaders over their appearances. Gosar has also shared animated images of political violence against his colleagues. In November, Gosar shared a photoshopped anime video on social media showing him appearing to kill New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Joe Biden. He was then censured by the House and stripped of his committee assignments, but only two Republicans \u2013 Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger and Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney \u2013 voted to censure Gosar for promoting violence. Republican leadership has yet to discipline Gosar, or Greene for that matter, for their ties to White nationalists beyond harsh words, even though, three years ago, they stripped another congressman from House committees \u200bfor lamenting that the terms White nationalist and White supremacist were considered \u201coffensive.\u201d Gosar\u2019s ties to extremists go back further than the violent social media posts he was censured for. He has long associations with White nationalists, a pro-Nazi blogger and far-right fringe players that have received little examination compared to his colleagues, according to an extensive CNN KFile review of Gosar\u2019s events and social media posts over the years. His endorsement, along with Greene\u2019s, has become highly sought after in local and national political primaries by like-minded candidates. A spokesperson for Gosar declined to comment on specific questions about the congressman\u2019s associates and instead offered a statement disparaging CNN\u2019s reporting. In his home state, Gosar engaged with local far-right Arizona figures, including sharing a post from Kyle Clifton, who has shared antisemitic images, and appeared in photos with Greyson Arnold, who has expressed admiration for Nazi Germany. The April 2021 trip Gosar took to the border included Arnold, a far-right blogger who has shared a post saying \u201cJewish led colored hordes\u201d are fighting the \u201cWhite Christian West.\u201d Arnold has repeatedly shared content saying the US fought on the wrong side in World War II, spread antisemitic conspiracy theories and falsely claimed there were \u201cJewish plans to genocide the German people.\u201d He recently shared posts questioning teaching of the Holocaust, calling it the original \u201ccritical race theory.\u201d Arnold regularly posts on the social media site Telegram under the moniker \u201cPure Politics.\u201d He wrote on Telegram he was invited by Gosar to the trip, and can be seen in various photos from attendees documenting the visit, which Gosar said was to pick up trash he claimed was left by \u201cillegal aliens pouring over our border.\u201d The trip also included right-wing activist Mary Ann Mendoza, who was abruptly pulled from speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2020 after she spread an antisemitic conspiracy theory describing an elaborate Jewish plan for global domination. She later deleted the tweet and claimed that she hadn\u2019t read \u201cevery post within the thread.\u201d \u201cMy apologies for not paying attention to the intent of the whole message,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cThat does not reflect my feelings or personal thoughts whatsoever.\u201d Another attendee, congressional candidate Jarome Bell, would later be banned from Twitter for calling for executing election officials. He had previously posted in 2020 his partial support of instituting martial law and arresting people for \u201ctreason and sedition\u201d after the 2020 election. In October 2020, Gosar was interviewed by Arnold during an event in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, where he told Arnold, \u201cWe really are in a civil war. It\u2019s just that the gunfire hasn\u2019t started.\u201d And this past January, Gosar shared on his Instagram page a photo posted from Arnold at an event with Gosar this year. Jared Holt, a fellow at the Atlantic Council and an expert on domestic extremism, told CNN that politicians like Gosar and Greene speaking and associating with these figures and groups gives those ideas new credibility and legitimacy. On social media, Gosar regularly engages with far-right personalities and memes. Gosar has repeatedly promoted the work of and tagged Vincent James Foxx, who was recently banned from Twitter and has a history of deeply antisemitic statements. The Anti-Defamation League has labeled Foxx as a White supremacist. Gosar shared on Instagram a screenshot of himself with Ethan Schmidt-Crockett, who harassed a store specializing in wigs for cancer patients last summer because it required customers to wear masks and is the founder of the AntiMaskersClub. Schmidt-Crockett was recently banned from the Arizona House after harassing a Democratic lawmaker by using a racial slur. In a video of Gosar and Schmidt-Crockett posted in December 2021, Gosar encourages the \u201cAnti Vaxxers Club\u201d to stay the course. In November 2020, Gosar credited Mike Cernovich with a Phoenix \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally after the 2020 election, comparing Cernovich to civil rights icon Rosa Parks. Cernovich, a far-right commentator, is best known for his role peddling far-right conspiracy theories, including \u201cPizzagate,\u201d which bizarrely and falsely claimed Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman John Podesta were connected to a pedophilia ring run in a Washington, DC, pizza restaurant. The incident came to a head in December 2016 when a man fired an AR-15 inside the restaurant, saying he was attempting to find and rescue child sex slaves he believed were being held there. No one was injured. Gosar has also shared a column on Twitter from the UNZ Review, a website that has published Holocaust denialism and columns in support of White nationalism. He has shared a political consultant, Noel Fritsch, on his political campaigns with Paul Nehlen, the racist and antisemitic candidate who attempted to primary then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. The same consultant advised Bell, and Lauren Witzke, a 2020 congressional candidate who embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory. Gosar has also regularly appeared on fringe media, like the radio show of Dr. Bill Deagle, a conspiracy theorist who says the government created AIDS \u2013 and said such in his interview with Gosar to no pushback. He has also appeared multiple times on and shared content from the show of Stew Peters, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who has on multiple occasions called for hanging Dr. Anthony Fauci.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming called out two members of her conference who spoke at an event organized by White nationalist Nick Fuentes. \u201cAs Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep Paul Gosar speak at this white supremacist, anti-Semitic, pro-Putin event, silence by Republican Party leaders is deafening and enabling,\u201d Cheney tweeted Saturday. \u201cAll Americans should renounce this garbage and reject the Putin wing of the GOP now,\u201d she added. Greene, a Georgia Republican, spoke at the America First Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, on Friday \u2013 an event founded by the far-right activist Fuentes as an alternative to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, which is taking place this week. Gosar appeared at the American First Political Action Conference via a pre-recorded video, HuffPost reported. The Arizona Republican attended the same conference last year, and Cheney was the only member of House GOP leadership to directly call him out over it at the time. Cheney primary prompts sharp GOP divide in Washington Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who, like Cheney, has been increasingly marginalized within the GOP after criticizing former President Donald Trump\u2019s hold on the party, also made his criticism known, tweeting Saturday at Greene, \u201cIf this was not bizarro world, you would be the one censured and excommunicated from the GOP.\u201d Utah Sen. Mitt Romney backed up Cheney\u2019s remarks in an interview Sunday with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cLiz Cheney was right with that statement and has been right for a long time,\u201d the Republican senator said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place in either political party for this White nationalism or racism. It\u2019s simply wrong.\u201d Fuentes, who has been labeled a White supremacist by the US Justice Department and the Anti-Defamation League, has been banned from most major social media platforms for his White nationalist rhetoric. After Russian forces invaded Ukraine this week, Fuentes wrote on the messaging app Telegram, \u201cI am totally rooting for Russia,\u201d while also referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin as \u201cmy Czar.\u201d And the Republican Jewish Coalition took aim at Greene and Gosar for associating with Fuentes. \u201cIt is appalling and outrageous that a Member of Congress would share a platform with an individual who has actively spread antisemitic bile, mocked the Holocaust, and promoted dangerous anti-Israel conspiracy theories,\u201d the coalition said in a statement. Greene, meanwhile, defended her appearance at the event. \u201cI am not going to play the guilt by association game in which you demand every conservative should justify anything ever said by anyone they\u2019ve ever shared a room with. I\u2019m not going to be drawn into that. I\u2019m only responsible for what I say,\u201d she said in a statement Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m also not going to turn down the opportunity to speak to 1,200 young America First patriots because of a few off-color remarks by another speaker, even if I find those remarks unsavory,\u201d she added. She told reporters at CPAC on Saturday that she doesn\u2019t know Fuentes, or about his views, and condemned Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. Gosar and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Greene and Gosar have a history of pushing conspiracy theories and espousing inflammatory rhetoric. House Democrats voted to strip both lawmakers from their committee assignments last year. Gosar was also formally censured by the House in November over posting a violent anime video that depicted him killing a Democratic House member. Last year, Gosar denied knowing about a fundraiser Fuentes planned to host for him. Fuentes was also present on US Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021, and was subpoenaed by the House panel investigating the attack. He has promoted unsupported theories about fraud in the 2020 election.

Former President Donald Trump has signaled to Republicans that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a \u201cgenius\u201d for invading Ukraine. Now we shall see what happens. Will the party\u2019s lawmakers back President Joe Biden as he stands up to Putin? Or, as the majority did with a collective amnesia on the January 6 insurrection, will they retreat on promised sanctions and support for Ukraine? The GOP, already changed by Trump, may be molting again. The old party. Republicans used to stand up to Russia. During the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan demanded that Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev \u201ctear down this wall\u201d in Berlin. They used to oppose unwarranted invasions. In 1990, George H.W. Bush said to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that his aggression against Kuwait \u201cwill not stand.\u201d They used to recognize that even modern Russia is a threat to the US. Mitt Romney \u2013 who became the Republican presidential nominee in the 2012 race against President Barack Obama \u2013 said that year that Russia was the United States\u2019 main geopolitical foe. The 40 wildest lines from Donald Trump's interview with Clay Travis A new tone. The party today is under the influence of Trump, who heaped admiration on Putin for invading another country with a democratically elected leader. \u201cI went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, \u2018This is genius.\u2019 Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine, of Ukraine, Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday in an interview on \u201cThe Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show,\u201d a conservative radio show. He then suggested it would be nice to have a \u201cpeace force\u201d like the Russian military to be stationed on the US border with Mexico \u2013 a supremely flawed comparison since Trump wants to secure the border, whereas Putin appears to be set on claiming new territory. Putin has misleadingly referred to Russian forces he ordered to enter eastern Ukraine as \u201cpeacekeepers.\u201d Holdouts. It was Republicans like Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the few seeking accountability for the Capitol Hill insurrection, who openly criticized Trump\u2019s praise of Putin. Others\u2019 praise for Putin. Before the Ukraine invasion, there were already echoes of Trump\u2019s high regard for Putin among Republicans. Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called Putin \u201ca very talented statesman\u201d who has \u201clots of gifts\u201d in a Fox interview. The Kansas City Star wrote in detail about Pompeo\u2019s comments regarding Putin and Ukraine over the years. Disinterest in other democracies. After the invasion of Ukraine began, there was a lot of disinterest from conservative voices. \u201cAs an American, what\u2019s in this for me and my neighbors and the rest of us? And all I\u2019m getting is that we can feel morally satisfied because we hate Putin,\u201d Tucker Carlson said on Fox on Tuesday. J.D. Vance, an author and Trump acolyte running for Senate in Ohio, has pushed an almost isolationist view of foreign policy, arguing the US has no real interest in Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine and should instead be focused solely on the Southern border. \u201c\u2018America First\u2019 means not listening to the same people who have blundered us into disaster after disaster on the world stage,\u201d Vance said on Twitter on Wednesday. Coincidental alignment. Even Republicans who talk about the need to support Ukraine have suggested the US might reject out of hand, as Putin desires, admitting Ukraine into NATO. Sen. Josh Hawley, the fist-pumping Missourian who helped question the US presidential election results, recently wrote a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioning the wisdom of even entertaining the idea of adding Ukraine to NATO. It just so happens that Putin\u2019s main goal of halting the expansion of NATO is exactly in line with Hawley\u2019s letter. An authoritarian and a wannabe authoritarian. Trump\u2019s reverence of Putin is well documented, as are Putin\u2019s efforts to meddle in recent US presidential elections with an eye toward helping Trump\u2019s chances. Putin has won elections with unbelievable support. Trump is still won\u2019t believe he lost the 2020 election. Both men may be running again in 2024. In fact, their interests have often dovetailed. Putin wants to beat NATO back to its Cold War membership and undermine European unity. Trump groused about NATO throughout his presidency, and frequently misrepresented NATO\u2019s requirement that member nations spend 2% of their GDP on defense. He moved to pull US troops from Germany, which drew warnings from people like Romney, although NATO officials tried to put a positive spin on the move. At news of the drawdown of US troops in Europe, CNN\u2019s Nic Robertson wrote in August 2020 that it could be Trump\u2019s \u201clast gift to Putin before the election.\u201d Trump did place sanctions on Russia while he was President, but only after Congress essentially made him do it. Republicans tough on Russia. That\u2019s not to say Trump\u2019s Putin envy is universal in the GOP. It is not. A bipartisan sanctions bill failed to pass before Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, but Republicans have been working with Democrats on the issue. They even released their own GOP-only proposal for tough sanctions when the bipartisan talks hit snags last week. After Biden enacted sanctions, some Republicans were complimentary. \u201cIt is good to see President Biden do the right thing,\u201d Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN in a statement on Wednesday, referring to Biden\u2019s efforts to sanction the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. Risch would have preferred Biden to be more forceful on the pipeline earlier. \u201cThe next step is to work with Germany to ensure this geopolitical threat remains dead, never to be resurrected,\u201d he said. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also offered rare praise for Biden for the sanctions, but he has also recently accused Biden of weakness. The McConnell example. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, while accusing Biden of foreign policy weakness, has also promised to stand up to Russia alongside the Democrats. McConnell argues Putin built up troops on the Ukraine border only after Biden withdrew the US from Afghanistan. Never mind that Biden was largely following the example of Trump on that particular issue. Many Americans don\u2019t care about Russia and Ukraine. Disinterest in maintaining international democracies is common in the US. A new AP-NORC poll, released Wednesday and conducted as the Ukraine standoff grew more tense, suggests about half of Americans think the US should play only a minor role in the situation. Almost a third of independents and about a fifth of Republicans think the US should play no role at all. Nationalist Russia. One explanation for why Republicans are less concerned with Russia, in addition to signaling from Trump, may be ideological. In the AP-NORC poll, Republicans are far more concerned than other subgroups about a direct threat from China, which is still a Communist country, than from Russia, which is not. Republican attacks on Democrats for veering toward socialism have now lasted much longer than the Soviet Union. Russia, under Putin, is a nationalist regime. And in that could lie much of what Trump, who pushed American nationalism as US President, covets.",

            "article_content": "Vladimir Putin is doing it again. He\u2019s got Washington in a frenzy. Everyone\u2019s got a theory about what the Russian president plans for Ukraine. But no one really knows. Maybe he doesn\u2019t himself. While Americans across the country fret about high inflation and daily disruptions from the pandemic, Putin has once again forced a country many American foreign policy officials view as a creaking superpower in inexorable decline to center stage in the US capital. US alleges Russia planning false flag operation against Ukraine using 'graphic' video Russia is on everybody\u2019s lips in DC \u2013 just as it was in 2016 when Putin created a political hall of mirrors in the US, distorting reality and truth with an election meddling operation that is still delivering discord and ripping the country\u2019s divides ever deeper. For President Joe Biden, foreign policy has come full circle. He first arrived in Washington in the Cold War deep freeze. Half a century later, he finds himself wrestling with a Russian counterpart who never regarded the superpower standoff as resolved. Their confrontation over Ukraine might seem an arcane tussle of wills. But Putin is holding the independent democracy that used to be part of the Soviet Union hostage to try to force Biden to agree to pull NATO troops out of Moscow\u2019s former orbit in eastern Europe. Their duel is about whether people can chose their own leaders and political systems and whether big nations can get away with invading smaller ones; whether democracy and international rules can prevail; and whether market economies can freely function or must exist under the heavy hand of the state or oligarchs. Once again, as was the case late in the 20th century, members of Congress are huddled in secret briefings with US spy agencies trying to work out what the Kremlin is up to. But in this modern-day showdown, Putin has turned Republicans on Republicans as a split emerges between traditional hawks and pro-Trump populists. He\u2019s forced the White House to pay attention to him by circling independent, western-leaning Ukraine with troops. He\u2019s opened diplomatic tracks to try to pry NATO allies apart. His pressure last week caused a public meltdown between the US and Ukrainian governments over whether the Russians plan to invade. Putin has won adoring coverage in US conservative media \u2013 an achievement that would have been unthinkable for any Soviet leader. And rattled nerves over Russia even spilled over into a row between the State Department and its press corps Thursday, which was bizarrely accused of taking solace in Russian propaganda. Behind the Wall: The relationship between China's Xi and Russia's Putin grows as both seek to upend Western values -- including democracy and freedom At any given moment, in the Russian leader\u2019s reign of confusion, it\u2019s hard to evaluate whether he\u2019s blinking under Western pressure, doubling down by adding to his garrison or simply at a loss what to do himself with no clear endgame in sight to the showdown. Putin pressed some more American buttons on Friday when he met the rising foe that Washington really wants to focus on \u2013 President Xi Jinping of China. He\u2019s sure to spook political analysts with hints of a Beijing-Moscow axis. Xi and Putin vowed to deepen their strategic coordination, according to a readout of the exchange between the two leaders by Chinese state media Xinhua News on Friday. If Putin\u2019s aim with his build up opposite Ukraine is to tie the West in knots, to have everyone obsessing over Russia \u2013 whether he ends up invading the ex-Soviet state or not \u2013 it\u2019s worked. In Washington on Thursday, the focus initially was on a US raid in Syria overnight that had led to the death of the leader of ISIS. But inexorably, the focus was dragged back to speculation over Putin\u2019s intentions. No one can agree on what Russia is going to do, when it might do it, or what the US should do in response. And that might be exactly the point of Putin\u2019s game. After previously saying that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was \u201cimminent,\u201d the US has stopped using that word since the invasion hasn\u2019t come. That\u2019s a small victory for the Russian leader, in the phony war of attrition that might or might not precede an invasion, which could last weeks or months. As an example of the confusion that Putin has sown on Capitol Hill, lawmakers are emerging from briefings after hearing the same classified information with differing interpretations of what might happen next. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said it was a \u201cnear certainty\u201d that Putin would invade Ukraine. But House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith disagreed. The Washington state Democrat told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Thursday: \u201cI don\u2019t think we know that yet.\u201d And Senate Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, suggested that nobody \u201cknows whether Putin has made the ultimate decision.\u201d The lack of cohesion about Putin\u2019s motives is beginning to be reflected in disputes about how the US should respond \u2013 another success for the Russian leader\u2019s long-term push to stir angst that tarnishes Western democracy. Traditional national security Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have been pushing Biden to take a tougher stand against Russia for weeks and have welcomed his decision to dispatch troops to Europe. Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, whom ex-President Barack Obama mocked in a 2012 presidential debate for warning about Moscow\u2019s threat, is suddenly in demand. Biden lands a presidential moment that may be fleeting with strike on ISIS leader \u201cIt\u2019s very clearly a sign to our allies that we care about NATO, we care about Europe. And it\u2019s a signal to Putin as well that we care about Europe and that we care about our allies as we do,\u201d Romney said, backing Biden\u2019s troop deployments. But there are clear signs that the anti-NATO, \u201cAmerica first,\u201d sentiment that is a hangover from the Trump administration is a growing force in the Republican Party. Indiana Sen. Mike Braun said that he is against sending more troops to Europe. \u201cI think that\u2019s a scrambling feature that we\u2019re doing late in the game,\u201d Braun said. It\u2019s also clear that the conservative media\u2019s misinformation implying Biden is sending troops directly to fight Russia instead of defending US interests at home may be starting to soak in. Tennessee Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, for instance, coined a sentiment often voiced by pro-Trump opinion hosts. He said the Biden administration should send \u201ctroops to our southern border.\u201d And Kansas Republican Sen. Roger Marshall said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant boots on the ground.\u201d \u201cHaving a son that\u2019s an enlisted man in the Army myself, it\u2019s a big deal. I think economically, we need to know, does the European Union have any moxie? \u2026 They need to be leading on this. I think we need to be a participant, but it just feels like we\u2019re escalating the situation.\u201d European diplomats might be advised to listen carefully to such senators, a rising block in the party that once celebrated its greatest Cold Warrior, President Ronald Reagan, for orchestrating victory over the Soviet Union. Any weakening of the transatlantic alliance would be a huge win for Putin. To Western eyes, Putin\u2019s behavior often seems self-defeating and illogical. It looks like he\u2019s making it up as he goes along. Even if that\u2019s the case, it makes him harder to read. One view right now is that the Russian position is eroding, that Putin has backed into a corner with more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s border, and it will be difficult for him to climb down and save face. If he invades, it\u2019s hard for Washington to see how Putin could fashion a win for Moscow during what could be a bloody occupation and insurgency. The fierce punishments that the West is threatening to clamp on Russia\u2019s economy also seem like a steep price to pay. Putin\u2019s wider strategic dance seems to make little sense either. After all, his demands that NATO withdraw troops and arms from Eastern Europe caused Biden to call his bluff this week by ordering 3,000 troops to Germany, Romania and Poland. Here's why presidents send US troops abroad But the logic of Putin\u2019s worldview, rooted in a desire to restore respect, attention and status to Russia 30 years after the end of the Cold War, operates in a different universe from that of the West. The world looks different from Moscow. One theory in Washington is that Putin is now so isolated inside his own regime that\u2019s he\u2019s not getting good outside advice. But he\u2019s keeping the West on edge \u2013 and that may be a goal in itself. There is some hope that Putin\u2019s willingness to talk is a sign he\u2019s not serious about an invasion \u2013 he just spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron, for instance. But at the same time, Biden\u2019s dispatch of troops to defend NATO allies is already being spun in Moscow as proof of Putin\u2019s argument that the West is threatening Russia\u2019s borders and security. Such arguments can be used to build legitimacy for his own strongman rule. The Russian leader often uses nationalism to prop up a government in perpetuity that relies on oppression, crushing media freedoms and locking up dissidents. And signs of political acrimony in the US, which Putin is by now an expert at whipping up, play into Russian notions that a state that prizes stability and order over democracy works best. With his foreign policy under intense scrutiny following the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden has \u2013 a few instances of clumsy messaging aside \u2013 performed strongly in the Ukraine crisis, at least in the eyes of those who prefer a US President to behave as a traditional leader of the West. He has signaled to Putin that NATO\u2019s strategic alliance is inviolate and that its Eastern European members will be defended. He\u2019s offered the Russian leader diplomatic offramps through diplomacy though hasn\u2019t compromised Western strategic principles. And he\u2019s rallied some reluctant allies into signing up for a package of unprecedented sanctions meant to deter Putin from an invasion. Russian troop buildup in Belarus is a 'big worry' to US and European officials One intriguing feature of this showdown has been the willingness of the US and Britain especially to play the Russians at their own propaganda game. In the latest use of declassified intelligence, Washington on Thursday accused Russia of preparing to \u201cfabricate a pretext for an invasion\u201d by creating a \u201cvery graphic propaganda video.\u201d Officials said Moscow could stage an attack against \u201cRussian speaking peoples\u201d in Ukraine in order to justify moving across the border. This is especially worrying because it mirrors arguments that Russia used before annexing Crimea, sovereign Ukrainian territory, in 2014. Russian denied the allegation. And the problem with the West dealing with intelligence is that such material can be open to doubt and counter-propaganda, since a desire to protect sources and methods means it is difficult to back up such claims with evidence in public. That issue caused a spat in the State Department briefing on Thursday when spokesman Ned Price said journalists just needed to trust the government \u2013 despite decades of previous examples of officials misleading the American people. \u201cIf you doubt the credibility of the US government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is, that is for you to do,\u201d Price said. If he achieves nothing else, Putin\u2019s success in setting Americans against themselves might be payoff enough for his thuggery over Ukraine.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump conjured a vision of a second term that would function as a tool of personal vengeance, and become even more authoritarian than his first, when he vowed to pardon US Capitol insurrectionists if he runs for the White House again and wins. His pledge at a Texas rally Saturday was accompanied by a call for demonstrations if prosecutors in New York, who are probing Trump\u2019s business practices, and those in Georgia, looking into his attempts to reverse his election loss in the state, do anything that he defined as wrong or illegal. The comments underscore Trump\u2019s obsession with delusional lies that he won the 2020 election, and his determination to put that falsehood at the core of the Republican worldview. As was often the case during his four years in office, Trump\u2019s pardons threat shows that he still makes no distinction between his personal goals and the national interest or rule of law. But the former President\u2019s new rhetorical outburst also at times hinted at concern with his own legal position, and comes at a moment when various criminal and congressional lines of investigation seem to be tightening around him. The House select committee probing the January 6, 2021, riot has now penetrated deep inside Trump\u2019s West Wing inner circle, and he lost a Supreme Court bid to keep key documents secret. The likelihood of a damning accounting from the committee, bristling with new details about Trump\u2019s attempt to destroy American democracy, is growing, though the GOP has sought to thwart it at every turn. Lindsey Graham calls Trump's January 6 remarks 'inappropriate' As well as further threatening US democracy on Saturday night, Trump was preoccupied with his personal legal exposure. He fired off a wild attack, which looked to be racially-motivated, on two Black New York prosecutors investigating whether his business empire deliberately falsified accounts to get preferential treatment on loans and income taxes. He also alluded to potential legal peril he\u2019s facing in Fulton County, Georgia, where a Black district attorney has been granted a special grand jury to examine his attempt to steal President Joe Biden\u2019s win in the state. In a sign of the potential impact of Trump\u2019s incitement, District Attorney Fani Willis wrote to the FBI on Sunday asking for an immediate risk assessment for the Fulton County Courthouse and government buildings. She said that \u201csecurity concerns were escalated this weekend\u201d by the former President\u2019s speech and added that her office had already received \u201ccommunications\u201d from people unhappy with the investigation before Trump\u2019s rally. Trump\u2019s pressure on investigators prompted Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who sits on the House committee probing the insurrection, to warn that the ex-President had issued a \u201ccall to arms.\u201d \u201cCalling out for demonstrations if, you know, anything adverse, legally, happens to him, is pretty extraordinary. And I think it\u2019s important to think through what message is being sent,\u201d the California Democrat told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on Sunday. In yet another sign of Trump\u2019s incessantly consuming inability to accept his election loss, he issued a statement that same evening slamming former Vice President Mike Pence for refusing his demands to overturn the result of the democratic election in 2020, and falsely claimed that the then-vice president had the power to do so. 'He must be kidding': Lawmaker reacts after Trump goes after Pence With Trump and his fans already referring to him as the 45th and the 47th President, his fixation with the 2020 election may also represent a growing problem for the Republican Party. In the midterm elections in November and beyond, the GOP wants to build a case that Biden is weak, flailing at home and abroad and has lost his grip on inflation. But Trump, who wants to use the elections to demonstrate his hold on the GOP grassroots, threatens to detract from that simple Republican message. While the ex-President remains wildly popular with the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d crowd, his loss in 2020 poses the question of whether Republicans \u2013 and independents and suburban swing voters \u2013 want to get stuck forever in Trump\u2019s unhinged 2020 feedback loop. Some other potential 2024 presidential candidates, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are meanwhile demonstrating that Trump\u2019s populist nationalism and assault on what supporters view as liberal elites will be waged long after the 45th President has left the scene. Democrats failed in their attempt to make Trump the bogeyman in last year\u2019s Virginia gubernatorial election, when Republican Glenn Youngkin kept his distance from the ex-President and tapped into voter concerns about education, Covid exhaustion and rising prices. But it will be an easier case for Democrats to make when Trump is holding wild rallies in swing states and again makes himself the face of the party in 2022, spreading his lies, spewing increasingly racist rhetoric and behaving like an autocrat in waiting. Trump\u2019s latest comment on pardons was in line with his attempt to whitewash the truth of a day when his mob, incited at his Washington rally, invaded the Capitol to try and disrupt the certification of Biden\u2019s win, beat up police officers and sent lawmakers running for their lives. Throughout his presidency, he used the chief executive\u2019s pardon power to shield his political cronies. \u201cIf I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. \u201cAnd if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.\u201d People dragged into the criminal justice system because they tried to stage a coup based on lies about a stolen election are not being treated unfairly. But it is characteristic of Trump\u2019s democracy-threatening brand of politics to play up a sense of grievance and victimhood. He spent four years of his twice-impeached presidency sowing a narrative that opponents and subordinates who tried to check him were in fact the ones guilty of abusing power. And he repeatedly sought to force the Justice Department to embrace his anti-constitutional schemes. Several high-profile Republicans quickly dismissed Trump\u2019s offer to help January 6 insurrectionists. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who disappointed the national party by passing on a Senate bid, said on Sunday that those responsible for the insurrection must be held accountable. Asked by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d about the possibility of a pardon for such Trump supporters, Sununu, who is emerging as a standard bearer for a possible post-Trump GOP, said: \u201cOf course not. Oh my goodness, no.\u201d Senate GOP sets high bar to support Biden's Supreme Court pick One of Trump\u2019s closest enablers, Sen. Lindsey Graham, also dismissed Trump\u2019s promise in an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI think it\u2019s inappropriate. I don\u2019t want to reinforce that defiling the Capitol was okay. I don\u2019t want to do anything that would make this more likely in the future,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. His comments were notable since he has previously warned that the GOP needs to find a way to work with Trump if it wants to wield power. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also condemned Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cI do not think \u2026 President Trump should have made that pledge to do pardons. We should let the judicial process proceed. January 6 was a dark day in our history,\u201d said Collins, who just won reelection in 2020, speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d She also said it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that she would support Trump if he does officially decide on a third presidential run. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the party\u2019s most vocal critics of Trump and his hold on the Republican Party, tweeted Monday that \u201cTrump uses language he knows caused the Jan 6 violence; suggests he\u2019d pardon the Jan 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy; threatens prosecutors; and admits he was attempting to overturn the election. He\u2019d do it all again if given the chance.\u201d This must have been a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Republicans who often had their talking points overshadowed by the ex-President\u2019s extremism when he was in power. But it is one thing for key Republicans to criticize the ex-President now. On every previous occasion when the GOP faced a choice between appeasing Trump to keep or win power and standing up for American democracy and the rule of law, it has chosen the first option. In a sense, Trump\u2019s demagoguery this weekend was a fresh sign that he is convinced that his personality cult still holds his party in thrall. The House Republican conference has already demonstrated that it would act as a vessel of Trump\u2019s power and vengeance if it wins the majority in November. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has put the ex-President at the center of his efforts to become speaker of the House and has been put on notice by pro-Trump members like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene that departures from the ex-President\u2019s dogma could doom his hopes. And former Speaker Newt Gingrich encapsulated the extremism of the House GOP when he suggested last week that a new majority should throw members of the January 6 committee in jail. The ex-President\u2019s speech was also notable for an extraordinary assault on prosecutors in New York who are investigating allegations of fraud at his business empire. The ex-President called for \u201cthe biggest protests we have ever had\u201d if the prosecutors \u201cdo anything wrong or illegal.\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. are both leading investigations into Trump\u2019s business empire. And both are Black, a point that Trump hinted at in his complaints about his treatment. \u201cThese prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They\u2019re racists and they\u2019re very sick \u2013 they\u2019re mentally sick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going after me without any protection of my rights from the Supreme Court or most other courts. In reality, they\u2019re not after me, they\u2019re after you,\u201d he told his crowd. Fulton County district attorney asks for FBI's help with security as Trump investigation continues It was the second recent occasion when Trump has sought to stir up racial hatred as part of his increasingly dangerous rhetoric. He claimed at a rally in Arizona two weeks ago that White people could not get Covid-19 treatment or vaccines in New York, grossly distorting a policy that says that race should be one factor in the use of limited therapies for a disease that disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic populations. Trump\u2019s speech once again presented a conundrum about how much attention should be paid to an ex-President who is using his high profile to stir division and outrage in order to stay politically relevant. Yet given his power in the Republican Party and the intensity of those who follow a once and possible future President who has already incited a coup to overthrow an election, it would be unwise to ignore the implications of his rage. Even out of office, Trump has convinced millions of Americans that the election was stolen and Biden is an illegitimate president. Multiple Republican-run states have passed laws that make it harder to vote and easier for political officials to interfere in election results rooted in his false claims of voter fraud. And Trump is touring the country inciting polarization and racial animus as the hot favorite for the GOP 2024 nomination. John Dean, a former White House counsel to President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, condemned Trump\u2019s remarks on pardons in a chilling tweet. \u201cThis is beyond being a demagogue to the stuff of dictators. He is defying the rule of law. Failure to confront a tyrant only encourages bad behavior,\u201d Dean wrote. \u201cIf thinking Americans don\u2019t understand what Trump is doing and what the criminal justice system must do we are all in big trouble!\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. The noose and gallows. The Confederate Army revivalists. The White power hand gestures. Incited by then-President Donald Trump, the January 6 insurrectionists took aim not merely at democracy but also at multiracial democracy. The siege of the US Capitol fits into a history of White backlash, as yet another effort to maintain a strict racial order. One year on, as the House select committee probes the attack and as many Republican-led state legislatures enact laws that limit Black Americans\u2019 access to the ballot box, it\u2019s worthwhile to examine how January 6 lives on in national politics, and explore what that day might reveal about race in the US. One way to view January 6 is through the lens of US mythology. In the late 1800s, the myth of the Lost Cause grew in popularity. It was an attempt to revise history at least in part by recasting as honorable and valiant the men who went to war in support of the Confederacy \u2013 an antidemocratic nation-state whose very existence depended on the bondage of people of African descent. An analogous discourse has been underway in the months since January 6, as people on the political right \u2013 from lawmakers to shock jocks \u2013 seek to portray as the \u201ctrue\u201d Americans those who, at Trump\u2019s exhortation, stormed the seat of US government in an effort to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 presidential election. The battle that will define America in 2022 began in 1865 Unsurprisingly, the insurrectionists \u2013 more than 700 of whom have been charged by the Department of Justice in connection with the assault \u2013 have embraced the fantasy that they\u2019re patriots who\u2019ve been wrongly targeted by the government. \u201cIt has many of the same trappings (as the Lost Cause),\u201d Seyward Darby, the author of the 2020 book \u201cSisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism,\u201d told CNN, referring to January 6. \u201cThere are these notions of: \u2018We were trying to do the right thing. We were trying to do the noble thing. We were trying to do the American thing. And we were stymied by these forces that want to radically change the shape of the country.\u2019\u201d Hakeem Jefferson, an assistant professor of political science at Stanford University whose research focuses on the role identity plays in shaping political behavior, echoed some of Darby\u2019s sentiments. He stressed that January 6 was a racial reckoning \u2013 against the multiracial coalition that installed Biden in the White House, and against the presumed strength of Black voters. \u201cWhen we think about January 6, we can\u2019t disconnect it from the claims by Trump and other Republican elites that there was voter fraud in predominantly Black cities,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cJanuary 6 was an attempt by a dwindling White majority to maintain political power \u2013 irrespective of the means.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019d be a mistake to view January 6 as a singular event, or as separate from the rest of the scheming defining the current political season. After all, Republican lawmakers haven\u2019t stopped at lauding the insurrectionists. They\u2019ve been directing their powers at weakening multiracial democracy, using tools such as aggressive gerrymanders and, maybe most visibly, voting restrictions. Between January 1 and December 7, lawmakers in at least 19 states passed 34 laws that make it harder for people to vote, according to a recent tally from New York University Law School\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. Much of this political gamesmanship disproportionately disadvantages voters of color, specifically Black voters. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers have failed to pass legislation that might protect access to the franchise. What the country saw on January 6 was \u201ca battle over the place of White people, and what appears to be a shifting racial hierarchy,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cIt\u2019s the fear of that change in status that formed the basis of January 6. But it\u2019s also formed the basis of the other, less vivid attacks on democracy that come by way of Republican legislatures\u2019 attempts to subvert the will of the people.\u201d Darby put it in equally blunt terms. \u201cJanuary 6 is something that people can hold up as a Lost Cause and talk about from a symbolic standpoint,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also part of a wider war. Thinking about it that way, to me, is really the only way you can get the full picture of where we are and where we\u2019re headed.\u201d Is it possible to rein in these darker forces \u2013 the White rage and resentment that fueled January 6 and that, certainly at present, sustain the Republican Party? It\u2019s hard to say. For one, in many state elections, the GOP doesn\u2019t require the buy-in of multiracial coalitions, so it can hew to the preferences of the most conservative White voters. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the unfortunate pieces of US politics,\u201d Jefferson explained. \u201cBecause the Republican Party doesn\u2019t believe itself to be a party in need of Black support or the support of other racial and ethnic minorities on any serious level, it can organize a political and rhetorical program that\u2019s really in line with the interests of ultraconservative, racist voters.\u201d Jefferson went on, \u201cMy fear not as a partisan but as somebody who cares deeply about this country is that the Republican Party is going to continue, for the foreseeable future, to bank on this kind of politics of resentment and White grievance.\u201d Eliminating the Senate filibuster, curbing partisan gerrymanders, prohibiting state officials from corrupting the vote-counting process: These are some of the ways to push back against the current crisis. Another: breaking with the two-party system. The US\u2019s outmoded political structure, dominated by the two major parties, keeps diverse representation and pluralism just beyond reach, and in fact helps clear the way for the GOP to rule by representing only a narrow minority of voters \u2013 mostly White conservatives. \u201cAs long as we maintain our two-party system, and continue the winner-take-all electoral institutions that pose steep barriers to new parties, there is no way out of this doom loop,\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the Political Reform Program at New America, wrote for CNN\u2019s Race Deconstructed newsletter last month. What the US needs, Drutman added, \u201cis transformative electoral reform: proportional representation that will open the door to new parties, and guarantee that an illiberal minority can\u2019t gain majority power.\u201d Achieving reform of that scope might seem unlikely, given the US\u2019s fierce political divisions, but it may well be one of the country\u2019s few hopes for charting a path forward.",

            "article_content": "It isn\u2019t a leap to say that Jerry Mitchell\u2019s new book, \u201cRace Against Time: A Reporter Reopens the Unsolved Murder Cases of the Civil Rights Era,\u201d is a piece of real-life horror. After all, as the subtitle suggests, it grapples not merely with the dead but with the fact that, for decades, the normalized bigotry of the 1960s that killed so many innocent Americans went largely unpunished, and in turn haunted those desperate for even a scrap of justice. Yet \u201cRace Against Time\u201d is more than a book about the past. It tells us a lot about today, arriving at a moment when history and its repetitions are very much on Americans\u2019 minds. Days after the book was published, for example, more than 100 masked white nationalists paraded through Washington\u2019s National Mall, chanting \u201cReclaim America!\u201d and \u201cLife, liberty, victory!\u201d The march was uneventful. But it was one of several such spectacles since President Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016 to illuminate the reemergence of white nationalism in the country\u2019s public spaces. To coincide with Black History Month, I recently spoke with Mitchell, who after three-plus decades at The Clarion-Ledger left and founded the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting, about \u201cRace Against Time\u201d and the way its stories insinuate themselves into the current political season. Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley; Medgar Evers; James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner; Vernon Dahmer. Over the course of 400-some pages, Mitchell revisits, in diaristic detail, the four notorious instances of Ku Klux Klan violence that stole these lives and his efforts \u2013 dating back to the \u201980s, when he was a rookie journalist in Mississippi \u2013 to put some of the men responsible behind bars. The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. You\u2019ve been writing about cold cases from the mid-century civil rights era since the 1980s, when you were a junior reporter at The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi. What drew you to these stories? The injustice of it all really angered me. More than 20 Klansmen were involved in killing three young civil rights workers \u2013 James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner \u2013 and no one was ever tried for murder. I just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it: Wait a minute. I\u2019ve heard of people getting away with murder, but a triple murder? But it wasn\u2019t just that these guys got away with murder. It was also the fact that everybody knew that they got away with murder. It was injustice in plain sight. In \u201cRace Against Time,\u201d you describe how a screening of the 1988 movie \u201cMississippi Burning,\u201d which is loosely based on the murders of these three young men, also fueled your journalistic work. I watched the film for the first time while preparing for this interview, and \u2013 Oh, you watched it! What did you think? Well, I really like two elements: the acting, particularly Frances McDormand\u2019s performance, and how the movie recreates the sheer terror of the Ku Klux Klan \u2013 the distinct code of silence that allowed the group to operate with impunity. That said, it\u2019s the exact sort of civil rights movie that Hollywood, still today, laps up, in how the film gives the most screen time and dimension to the white folks involved in the struggle. Have your thoughts changed since your initial viewing? I saw it again a few years ago, and I remember feeling that there are parts of it that hold up and parts of it that don\u2019t. You\u2019ve got to understand that when I first watched the movie, I knew nothing of that history. So it was very powerful and visceral. I don\u2019t think that anyone at the time walked out of that movie unaffected. They wondered: How did these guys not get charged with murder? And I think that was a legitimate question. You played a big role in reopening murder cases against some of America\u2019s most infamous killers, including former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers. Did this work change the way you view journalism? On the one hand, I was influenced by the journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward\u2019s 1974 book \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d which is about the Watergate scandal. I read that on my journey to becoming an investigative reporter. After reading that book, and as I began to dig into these cases, I started to see the power of journalism to effect positive change. On the other hand, at the time, I wasn\u2019t thinking about my own work on any kind of grand scale. I saw it in terms of what needed to be known and what needed to happen, so I kept peeling back different layers. I did realize early on that this is important, and so I started saving. I saved my notes and journals, and any kind of conversation I had with anybody, I wrote it down. So in that way, it was weirdly historical, but playing out in the present \u2013 it\u2019s history as you\u2019re living. I don\u2019t know if that happens very often. I wrote the book such that readers learn as I\u2019m learning. I pretty much start as a blank slate, so readers join my character as he figures things out. One thing that struck me while reading \u201cRace Against Time\u201d was the seeming benevolence of the FBI. I wasn\u2019t expecting this, given the FBI\u2019s historically barbed relationship with black Americans \u2013 tapping phones, subverting civil rights leaders\u2019 activities. Today, we hear renewed conversations about distrust in government, especially when it comes to the policing and surveillance of minority communities. Did writing about these civil rights cases complicate your understanding of the FBI? I was conflicted, because the FBI\u2019s history is very conflicted. Certain members were helpful to me, but it\u2019s important to remember what the FBI has done over the years. For instance, J. Edgar Hoover, who was the first director of the FBI, hated the civil rights movement and tried to stamp it out. And so, weirdly, some of what the FBI was doing \u2013 such as spying on and trying to discredit figures including Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, which sought to preserve racial segregation and contributed to the 1964 deaths of the three civil rights workers, was doing, too. Knowing all that provides crucial perspective. How history lives in the present \u2013 how it can be made urgent or dismissed \u2013 is one of the book\u2019s themes. What echoes of the past do you hear today? You see the rise, once again, of white nationalism. And you can\u2019t help but note, once you begin to understand the history, that any kind of breakthrough for black Americans seems to be met, on some level, with white backlash. For instance, Red Summer occurred in 1919, after black veterans returned from World War I and there was increasing labor competition. Before that, you had Reconstruction, in response to which you had the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the bloody quest to regain white power. Recently, there have been similarly purposeful efforts (to maintain a racial hierarchy). In 2015, Dylann Roof killed nine black church-goers in Charleston, South Carolina. He was motivated in part by the website of the Council of Conservative Citizens, which has roots in the White Citizens\u2019 Councils in Mississippi. What inspired you to start the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting? And what role do you see it playing in today\u2019s political environment? Mississippi needs more investigative reporting, not less. And this is the kind of reporting that can help to bring social and political change. Think of prisons, for example. Since last year, I\u2019ve been investigating prisons in the state, the crisis that\u2019s been going on. It\u2019s a whole hidden world. We basically warned the state that the prisons were going to blow up, and that\u2019s what happened. Now it\u2019s dealing with the consequences. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we do these things. If we hadn\u2019t done that reporting and the situation had blown up, I think that people would\u2019ve been asking: Well, what happened? But since we\u2019ve done the reporting, there\u2019s no mystery about what happened. That\u2019s valuable. I think that the tendency of governments is to run from transparency. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why what we do is so important: We want to increase transparency. We want to let the public know what\u2019s happening at the most basic level. We want to be proactive instead of reactive, which is one of the advantages of investigative reporting. Even when there\u2019s no attention being paid to an issue, you can say: Hey, we shouldn\u2019t turn away from this.",

Joseph is Barbara Jordan chair in ethics and political values and founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is a professor of history. He is the author of \u201cThe Third Reconstruction: America\u2019s Struggle for Racial Justice in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN. US Rep. Hakeem Jeffries\u2019 election to be the first Black minority leader in American history reflects the potential, possibility and power of multiracial democracy. The 52-year-old congressman representing New York\u2019s 8th Congressional District in Brooklyn and Queens, reflects both a generational and cultural shift from retiring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose legendary tenure made her a trailblazing feminist icon and an impeccably dressed breaker of glass ceilings, unafraid of tussling in public with former President Donald Trump. When Jeffries elucidated the case for impeaching Trump on the Senate floor in 2020, he ended by dropping a gem of a quote from the late, beloved Brooklyn-based rapper, the Notorious B.I.G. \u2014 \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t know, now you know.\u201d That a Generation X, hip-hop-quoting congressman has become the first Black person to lead a major party, with the potential of ascending to the speaker spot depending on the 2024 elections, is all the more remarkable considering tensions within the Democratic coalition and racial divisions with which America continues to wrestle. The May 25, 2020, murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis surfaced long simmering issues related to Black citizenship and dignity thought to have been answered during the civil rights movement\u2019s heroic period between the Supreme Court\u2019s school desegregation decision on May 17, 1954, and the April 4, 1968, assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. It makes sense for the face of the Democratic minority in Congress to be Black since those voters support the party more consistently than any other demographic. Yet while Blacks voted for Democrats in the midterms at well over 80%, this support shrank 4 percentage points from the 2018 midterms, according to network exit polling. Nancy Pelosi will be remembered as a political star So, while Democrats did better than expected in the midterms, thanks in large part, to a surprising robust youth turnout, support from voters of color lagged behind 2018 and 2020. As the Democratic congressional leader, Jeffries will be a cool-headed pragmatist and supporter of liberal and progressive policies who seeks to be an effective legislator. He may be able to convince the party to display a level of attentiveness and investment in Black voters often absent in favor of outreach to white suburban constituencies. Despite these efforts, nearly 60% of White voters supported Republicans, further evidence of a stark racial divide between constituents within the two major parties. The significance of a Black man leading House Democrats in 2023 is both symbolic and substantive. Symbolically, it represents a kind of racial progress unimaginable when the Congressional Black Caucus was founded in 1971 at the beginning of the 92nd Congress to provide community for the then-record number of 13 Black members of the House of Representatives. The first Black congressional officials were Republicans elected during the Reconstruction era in the decade after the Civil War. Their presence offering a hopeful example of the promise of multiracial democracy. This generation of Black officials helped to institutionalize what would become contemporary Democratic Party bread and butter issues, including public education, access to health care and public investments in infrastructure that helped to rebuild a physically wrecked and morally broken America in record time. A rising star for the Democrats It is one of this country\u2019s greatest ironies that arguably its greatest generation of statesman (for women still were denied the ballot and the right to hold public office) were ultimately denied equal access to the democracy they bled for in wartime and helped resuscitate during the tumultuous peace that followed. Jeffries stands on the shoulders of these 19th century leaders, as well as 20th century congressional icons such as Texas\u2019 Barbara Jordan, who cosponsored the 1975 Voting Rights Act extension, and Shirley Chisholm, the Brooklyn representative whose 1972 presidential campaign upended many of the rules of politics. Like Jordan, Jeffries is at times viewed with suspicion by some figures on the Democratic left. They see him as too mainstream for the radical change they feel is necessary to right a ship of state still reeling from voter suppression, racial injustice, economic inequality and legislative efforts that have tried to censor truth teaching in public schools. Last year, Jeffries observed, \u201cThe extreme left is obsessed with talking trash about mainstream Democrats on Twitter, when the majority of the electorate constitute mainstream Democrats at the polls.\u201d On this score Jeffries has helped organize a political action committee, Team Blue, to defend Democratic incumbents against being primaried from the left, a phenomenon that helped to create the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the eloquent and outspoken proponent of a Green New Deal whose criticism against conservative Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and moderates such as President Joe Biden, gave Pelosi fits as majority leader. Jeffries\u2019 leadership will, of course, be judged not by its symbolic merits, although considerably historic, but on substance.  The 21st century Democratic Party traverses a perilous tightrope in a political climate riven by racial, ideological and partisan divisions. These divisions not only threaten its precarious coalition but also reflect the fragility of American democracy in the aftermath of President Barack Obama\u2019s election, the rise of Black Lives Matter, the ascent of Trump, and the political and racial reckoning of 2020 and its fallout. America needs political leadership that can inspire disparate constituencies and star-crossed communities to coalesce around ideas, issues and goals that transcend party loyalty. Such leadership can help us reach into the rarified stratosphere of the kind of civic nationalism that has, in the past, led the nation to innovate the New Deal, defeat fascism during World War II, envision a Great Society and elect the first Black president. Hakeem Jeffries cannot, of course, be expected to embody this leadership on his own. But it is a testament to the national character, and the grace at times embedded within it, that the voice of the first Black leader of the Democratic minority in Congress will be seated at the head of the table as we deliberate on the future of our ongoing democratic experiment.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s story, \u201cSilver Blaze,\u201d Sherlock Holmes investigates the disappearance of a famous racehorse and the \u201ctragic murder of its trainer.\u201d A police inspector asks the detective, \u201cIs there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?\u201d Holmes replies, \u201cTo the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.\u201d \u201cThe dog did nothing in the night-time,\u201d the inspector said. \u201cThat was the curious incident.\u201d It was the dog that didn\u2019t bark \u2013 because it knew the intruder well \u2013 that helped Holmes solve the mystery. The red wave that didn\u2019t break could help unravel the mystery of what happened last week. Republicans failed to achieve the resounding midterm victory typically won by an opposition party against a president with a low approval rating. Democrats not only held on to control of the Senate but could increase their number by one if Georgia Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock defeats Republican Herschel Walker in a runoff election next month. And if Republicans win a House majority, it will be by just a few seats. It was only a little more than a week ago that Republicans thought they\u2019d be savoring a crushing victory \u2013 and some Democrats were starting to blame each other for what they feared would be a disaster. The New Yorker\u2019s Benjamin Wallace-Wells reported November 4 that GOP campaign strategists said their candidates, including those in in competitive Senate races like Walker in Georgia and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, were \u201cheading for a clean sweep.\u201d Wallace-Wells wrote, \u201cThe word that kept coming up in these conversations was \u2018bloodbath.\u2019\u201d The actual results sent some very different messages: \u201cPeople sometimes wonder what it will take to get young people to the polls,\u201d wrote Dolores Hernandez, a junior at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. \u201cWell, after the 2022 midterms, they no longer have to guess.\u201d \u201cPlace in front of us an existential issue that could determine our future. Give us the knowledge that we can have a say about issues that affect us with our votes, and we will turn out in droves.\u201d Hernandez and her fellow Gen Z friends saw abortion as that kind of existential issue. At the University of Michigan, student activist Isabelle Schindler noted that the line of students seeking same-day registration to vote \u201con Election Day stretched across \u2026 campus, with students waiting for over four hours. There was a palpable sense of excitement and urgency around the election on campus. For many young people, especially young women, there was one motivating issue that drove their participation: abortion rights.\u201d Nationally, exit polls showed that voters between the ages of 18 and 29 supported Democrats over Republicans by a 63% to 35% margin; no other age group was nearly as pro-Democratic, with voters over 45 strongly favoring Republicans.  Before the election, some pundits argued that the anger of many voters at the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade had faded after five months, and that inflation would blot out most other concerns. They also argued that President Joe Biden was out of touch for focusing a major pre-election speech on the threat election deniers running for office posed to democracy. But both of those issues resonated. \u201cThe abortion-rights side seemingly went a perfect five-for-five when it came to ballot initiatives, recognizing a state right to abortion in Michigan, California and Vermont,\u201d wrote law professor Mary Ziegler. \u201cKentucky, a deep red state, turned away an attempt to say that the state constitution did not protect a right to abortion. Montana\u2019s abortion measure, which threatened to impose criminal penalties on health care providers, was rejected by voters in Tuesday\u2019s referendum.\u201d For more: Edward Lindsey: In Georgia, here we go again A reader roundup: For many Americans, this election is different. It\u2019s personal John Avlon saw the midterms as \u201ca repudiation of former President Donald Trump\u2019s election lies and at least many of the top-ticket candidates who parroted them.\u201d \u201cYes, the economy matters \u2013 but so does democracy. And, in 2022, the message many voters were sending was \u2018it\u2019s the extremism, stupid.\u2019\u201d \u201cConsider the benchmarks for success in a typical midterm election: the opposition party gains an average of 46 seats in the House when the president is below 50% approval rating, as Biden is. While the final number is still being determined, GOP House gains will be far less than that,\u201d Avlon noted. \u201cWhat a relief,\u201d wrote Roxanne Jones. \u201cIt finally feels like a majority of voters want to re-center American politics away from the toxic, conspiracy theory-driven rhetoric we\u2019ve experienced over the past several years.\u201d In Pennsylvania, Democrat Josh Shapiro soundly defeated Republican candidate Doug Mastriano in the gubernatorial race. Mastriano \u201cscared many Pennsylvanians with his brash, take-no-prisoners Trump swagger,\u201d wrote Joyce M. Davis of The Patriot-News, the newspaper serving Harrisburg. \u201cHe inflamed racial tensions, embraced Christian nationalism, and once said women who violated his proposed abortion ban should be charged with murder. On top of all that, he\u2019s an unapologetic election denier,\u201d Davis observed. \u201cPlenty of voters are worried about unchecked progressivism on the left, but they\u2019re even more worried about unchecked extremism on the right,\u201d observed Tim Alberta, in the Atlantic. \u201cThat extremism takes many forms: delegitimizing our elections system, endorsing the January 6 assault on the Capitol, cracking jokes and spreading lies about the assault on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband. And all of this extremism, which so many swing voters spurned on Tuesday, is embodied by one person: Donald Trump.\u201d When Biden was asked by a reporter Wednesday what he would do differently in the remaining two years of his term, he answered: \u201cNothing.\u201d That might be understandable, given Biden\u2019s track record. \u201cThe midterms make clear that Biden is a much stronger president than he is often given credit for,\u201d wrote historian Julian Zelizer. \u201cHe has been underestimated and criticized despite having a formidable first two years. The midterms should make Republicans nervous as they think about 2024.\u201d Biden not only defeated an incumbent president, but was \u201cable to move a formidable legislative agenda through Congress, overcoming fierce Republican opposition and even winning a few GOP votes along the way. The American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act stand up as a historic trifecta \u2013 a legislative track record arguably more significant than any that we have seen since President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society.\u201d The midterms were \u201csupposed to be a shellacking of President Joe Biden, but it was Trump who got the thumping,\u201d Frida Ghitis wrote. \u201cIn exit polls, 28% of voters said they chose their House vote \u2018to oppose Donald Trump.\u2019 And just 37% said they had a favorable view of the former president, the presumed GOP front-runner, at least before this election. That should alarm the party\u2026\u201d \u201cDespite his awful showing, Trump plans to declare his candidacy soon. Most Democrats find the prospect hard to stomach, but most Republicans would also like him to just focus on his golf game,\u201d Ghitis noted. Conservative commentator Scott Jennings wrote, \u201cFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent a clear message to every Republican voter Tuesday night: My way is the path to a national majority, and former President Donald Trump\u2019s way is the path to future disappointments and continued suffering.\u201d \u201cFour years ago, DeSantis won his first gubernatorial race by less than a percentage point. His nearly 20-point win against Democratic candidate Charlie Crist on Tuesday sent the message that DeSantis, not Trump, can win over the independent voters who decide elections.\u201d For more: Sarah Lenti: Lauren Boebert\u2019s unexpectedly tight race shows the waning power of the MAGA brand Some careers were made \u2013 and others broken \u2013 in Tuesday\u2019s election. Wes Moore, who became the first Black governor of Maryland, is a rising star, wrote Peniel Joseph. \u201cA campaign based on championing equal opportunity, compassion for the incarcerated, education for all children, and hope in the future can not only win, but prove infectious enough to spread across the country,\u201d observed Joseph. \u201cWes Moore\u2019s victory has recaptured some of the magic that has been lost in our politics in the tumult of the past few years. Hopefully, this is just the beginning.\u201d Republicans are equally enthusiastic about DeSantis, but historian Nicole Hemmer suggested there are obstacles to his potential run for president. \u201cBefore declaring this the dawn of DeSantis, remember: It is just as likely the next few weeks will be the high-water mark of his presidential aspirations. The spotlight can very quickly become the hot seat, and DeSantis is both untested as a national candidate and as a Trump adversary. Those who see an easy pivot from the era of Trump to the age of DeSantis are likely in for another wave of disappointment, both because of the particulars of DeSantis\u2019 victory and the persistence of Trump\u2019s power.\u201d For Sophia A. Nelson, \u201cthe big heartbreak of the night\u201d was the defeat of Stacey Abrams by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp \u2013 \u201ca repeat of her defeat to him four years ago, when the two tangled for what at the time was an open seat\u2026\u201d \u201cHad Abrams succeeded, she would have been the first Black woman to become the governor of a US state. After her second straight electoral loss, America is still waiting for that breakthrough.\u201d In Texas, Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke lost to incumbent Republican Greg Abbott for governor. In the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Nicole Russell wrote that after \u201chis third huge loss, it\u2019s time for him to stop running for offices in Texas. We\u2019ve had enough Beto for one lifetime. \u2026 His liberal policies are unwelcome and unwanted in Texas.\u201d For more: David Andelman: Outside of America, this was an election that bucked the norm In a new sign its invasion is faltering, Russia pulled troops out of the city of Kherson, the only regional capital it captured in Ukraine since the February invasion. The architect of the war, President Vladimir Putin, may be able to retain control of his nation for a time despite the debacle, wrote Mark Galeotti. But continuing defeat on the battlefield is going to have an impact: \u201cWhatever happens \u2026 Putin\u2019s dreams of establishing Russia as a great power on the back of its military strength are over, and so too are his ambitions of securing a legacy as one of the nation\u2019s great state-builders.\u201d \u201cHis military machine is broken; his country\u2019s economy so scarred that it will take years to recover; his reputation as a geopolitical mastermind in tatters. Putin-the-man may still cling to power for years, but Putin-the-legend is dead.\u201d The actor Chris Evans received an accolade that was first bestowed on Mel Gibson in 1985, \u201ca candidate whose appeal, I think we can agree, has not aged well,\u201d Sara Stewart observed. \u201cPeople magazine recently announced this year\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive, which makes it a great time to ask: Can we get rid of the whole tradition of People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive?\u201d \u201cThink about the inherent ridiculousness of declaring anyone the sexiest person alive. Sexiness, by its very nature, is subjective. So it\u2019s a winky joke that People offers up its own tastes as if they are everyone\u2019s. And by making their subject male, they\u2019re tacitly saying: See, we\u2019re not objectifying women, we\u2019re so evolved. Men can be objects of lust too! Maybe that was (arguably) a subversive statement in the 1980s, when Playboy, Penthouse and other magazines imposed a misogynist ideal of sexiness at the newsstands. But now? Not so much.\u201d The new season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d which Netflix dropped on Wednesday, \u201ccharts the royals\u2019 course through the turbulent 1990s, including Prince Charles and Princess Diana\u2019s agonizing divorce and Elizabeth\u2019s \u2018annus horribilis\u2019 in 1992, when a fire destroyed much of Windsor Castle,\u201d wrote Holly Thomas. \u201cDetails of the show\u2019s storylines doing the rounds earlier this fall quickly drew ire, and one reportedly involving Charles, now King, lobbying for the Queen\u2019s abdication prompted former UK Prime Minister John Major to describe the series as a \u2018barrel-load of nonsense.\u2019\u201d Dame Judi Dench also warned that the series might \u201cblur the lines between historical accuracy and crude sensationalism\u201d as the nation continues to mourn Queen Elizabeth II, who died two months ago. But as Thomas noted, \u201cThe Crown\u201d hasn\u2019t \u201cmasqueraded as a documentary or claimed to perfectly replicate private moments between royal family members. It has done what historical TV shows, films, plays and literary fiction always have: Use factual events as loose outlines, fill them in using artistic license and trust the audience\u2019s intelligence to tell the difference. Its creator and writer, Peter Morgan, is a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for \u2018services to drama,\u2019 not history\u2026\u201d Elon Musk is going to have to try to fix Twitter without the help of journalist Roxanne Jones. She\u2019s had enough. \u201cI deleted Twitter on the day Elon Musk became the platform\u2019s new owner,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cAfter a mostly dysfunctional 12-year relationship with Twitter that I admit brought some moments of joy, it was time to exercise my freedom of speech to say goodbye and good riddance.\u201d \u201cThat small act may not change much in the Twitter-verse of 237.8 million users. But for me, quitting Twitter was an act of power and self-care. I was setting boundaries for what I will, and will not, allow in my life.\u201d \u201cData points about rising racism on Twitter can be illuminating, but they generally reinforce what we already know to be true. Like many Black women on the site, I can testify about what it feels like to be harassed and threatened with violence. I\u2019ve experienced it all. \u2026 I\u2019m done. I\u2019ll take my power and my voice and walk in the real world.\u201d Bill Carter and his wife don\u2019t normally buy lottery tickets, \u201chaving long concluded that it felt like burning a $10 bill (sometimes a $20 bill) on a barbecue grill.\u201d But last week\u2019s Powerball caught their attention as it soared toward a $2 billion jackpot \u2013 and they bought a few tickets. \u201cHow could we not? Think of what we could do with all that money!\u201d \u201cReally: What would we do with all that money? After helping the kids, donating to charities, buying several homes, etc., what else? Build a \u2018money bin\u2019 and swim around in it like Scrooge McDuck? (Unwise. Money can make you liquid, but it is not, in fact, liquid.)\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is how many people, like us, ignore lotteries until they soar to staggering amounts. Even a $100 million prize now barely raises eyebrows. As though that\u2019s too piddling to care? Wouldn\u2019t $100 million change most people\u2019s lives forever? \u201cIt would mine. But I don\u2019t buy tickets at that level. I only get the bug at about half a bill, but two bill? Ok, you really have my attention. \u201cWhat is that about? It\u2019s such an old impulse it\u2019s in Greek mythology.\u201d Bill isn\u2019t about to become King Midas.

As pop culture historian Roy Schwartz noted, \u201cIn 1934, at the age of 18, (Joseph) Shuster and classmate Jerome Siegel came up with a revolutionary idea: Superman. He was the first superhero, a concept so unprecedented that, as Siegel detailed in his unpublished memoir, every newspaper syndicate in the US rejected it for being too fantastic for children to relate to.\u201d Shuster described himself as \u201cmild-mannered, wore glasses, was very shy with women\u201d \u2013 more Clark Kent than Superman. But as Schwartz wrote, Shuster had a relationship with Helen Louise Cohen, a fellow resident of Cleveland, who might have borne a resemblance to Superman\u2019s eventual wife Lois Lane. Shuster sent her sketches of Superman along with at least one drawing of Cohen, and heartfelt letters in neat script. Ultimately, she broke it off, choosing instead to marry \u201ca dashing officer, later awarded the Legion of Merit and eventually becoming a colonel in the Army\u2019s 88th Infantry Division.\u201d Shuster was too nearsighted to enlist in the military during World War II. Cohen would later tell her sons, as Schwartz noted, that \u201cShuster was simply too mild-mannered for her.\u201d But she kept his letters and sketches and now the family is sharing them with the world, Schwartz wrote. \u201cThe real-life Clark never got his Lois, but his creation continues to woo her more than 80 years later.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This roundup is part of the CNN Opinion series \u201cAmerica\u2019s Future Starts Now,\u201d in which people share how they have been affected by the biggest issues facing the nation and experts offer their proposed solutions. A teacher at a community college in Texas working, in her words, \u201cin an environment that feels more and more like a prison.\u201d A lawyer from Massachusetts whose pregnant girlfriend got an abortion many decades ago and now \u2013 on the flip side of the separate, successful lives they both went on to live \u2013 says the \u201cthought of women of reproductive age being forced to birth an unwanted child into almost inevitable poverty and abuse by an uncaring government is not a part of my vision of what America is about.\u201d A New Yorker who after losing her father to Covid is still most afraid of gun violence: \u201cThe violence is everywhere and it feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before I\u2019m a victim. I\u2019ve always had street smarts, but that\u2019s not enough these days.\u201d Those are the perspectives of three of the hundreds of readers who shared stories with us about how they have been personally affected by key political issues coloring the 2022 midterm elections. Since the end of August, CNN Opinion has been collecting and curating these stories, focusing on illuminating how policy issues \u2013 inflation, abortion rights, climate change, Covid-19, education, gun violence and more \u2013 are making an impact on readers\u2019 day-to-day lives. Opinion: Who is at fault for America's soaring gun violence? Experts weigh in In the weeks leading up to the midterms, as part of a series called \u201cAmerica\u2019s Future Starts Now,\u201d a wide-ranging group of essayists, including a shooting survivor, three poll workers and an OB-GYN specializing in maternal-fetal medicine, have also shared how they have been transformed personally by a number of these issues. Multiple experts have offered their proposed solutions for the best ways forward. Now, with the election nearly here, it\u2019s time to hear from CNN Opinion readers about what\u2019s most urgent for them in these upcoming votes. For some of you, it comes down to a passionate belief in a woman\u2019s right to choose or the fears of how inflation or an unstable economy may hurt you and your family. One self-described longtime Democrat, for instance, wrote that he \u201ccan no longer support the party\u2026for me, it\u2019s not about abortion, it\u2019s not about climate change, gun control or any of the Democrats\u2019 big issues. It\u2019s about being able to put food on the table for my family. That\u2019s it in a nutshell. Gas prices, groceries bills, everything has gone up. We\u2019re in financial trouble and are barely getting by. Is [former President Donald] Trump a horrible person? Absolutely he is. But we could get by when he was in the White House, it\u2019s just a fact. I voted for Joe Biden and I\u2019ll never ever make that mistake again.\u201d Opinion: As America grapples with the climate crisis, 9 experts weigh in with solutions For others, this election lays bare deeper concerns. For example, Brandon moved to Minnesota from Utah last year with his husband and cited anxieties about the fate of his marriage under the rule of a conservative Supreme Court in a red state and the effects of climate change in the West as factors. But for him, life in general these days is about \u201cAnxiety after anxiety. It\u2019s never ending. \u2018Is it safe to go to the store today? What\u2019s the risk of a mass shooting in my area? Is Covid transmission high in my city? Can we afford non generic toilet paper? Will there even be any in stock?\u2019 My brain goes through both the logical and emotional responses to daily life in America.\u201d Such anxiety and fatigue at the realities of American life were palpable from many of you, sometimes existentially so. \u201cI want to hear from candidates for office exactly what measures they will put in place to stop global warming and save the world. Can any other issue even matter if we are facing our possible extinction?\u201d asked Benjamin from Illinois. Climate change was a strong concern for many, including the reader who wrote: \u201cMy wife and I have always wanted to move back to the Southwest when we retire. But, we are concerned about the forest fires and drought, which are becoming the \u2018new normal.\u2019 I\u2019m thankful that Biden and the congressional Democrats are working to deal with climate change. And, I\u2019m a bit shocked and disappointed that no Republicans are willing to vote for even modest bills that deal with the climate. Don\u2019t they have children and grandchildren, too?\u201d Opinion: Doctors didn't believe that I had Covid-19. I found a way to make them listen For others, the fear was not about policy issues or even daily life, but about the political system itself, concerns for US democracy. \u201cIf we do not secure the integrity of our democracy, the other issues won\u2019t matter,\u201d wrote one reader. \u201cDemocracy itself is on the ballot this fall,\u201d said another. Timothy from North Carolina put it this way: \u201cI vote in every election. It is a duty as an American. This election is a referendum on the soul of our country.\u201d We know the stakes are high and we are grateful to everyone who shared their experiences with us. Some entries have been lightly edited for clarity or flow. As a lifelong conservative-leaning independent, I feel I am in this enormous void; stuck somewhere in an invisible middle ground. While I share many (not all) basic conservative views, I feel that the MAGA crowd has taken this GOP to a place that I just cannot see any of us, outside of pure anarchists\u2019, would want to go. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves, while there are so many crucial issues facing us today of which these midterms stand to have major import. The elephant in the room (pun intended) is the looming possible return of Trump in 2024 and his influence on local, state and federal elected officials in these midterms. Should Trump manage to find his way back into office coddled by sycophantic election deniers at all levels, I truly fear our democracy may not survive. On the other hand, when I listen to those on the left, they are so far from representing me that I feel I am purposely being pushed away \u2013 not welcome or wanted in that camp. I am all for inclusivity, equal rights, tolerance and open-mindedness, but when it is taken to a level where it warps and turns into exclusivity, biasedness, intolerance and closed-mindedness in its own right, it gets us nowhere. So, of all these pressing issues we are faced with in these midterms, to me, without a doubt, the most pressing is this huge void between us. We no longer just disagree on these issues, but we despise, villainize and feel those who disagree with us are evil people looking to destroy our country. Not only is this sentiment not rejected and frowned upon by those who hold elected office, but it is often stoked mightily in attempts to appeal to respective bases, and garner votes. It\u2019s like an out of control brush fire. Unless we start seeing each other as fellow human beings perhaps with different views and opinions, and not as mortal enemies, nothing else will be solved. \u2013 Anthony G, Massachusetts Inflation is hurting my family. I work full time but it\u2019s getting really hard to keep up with our power bill and the food prices are scaring me. \u2013 Heather E., Decatur, IL Opinion: Americans are exhausted from dealing with inflation. 7 experts offer ideas for helping them cope I\u2019m a working woman in my late 20s with an advanced degree. I fought tooth and nail to avoid debt through school via scholarships and working. I got married during Covid, and I just bought a house last month amid soaring prices and interest rates because it was time for my family to invest in our future. Our lives don\u2019t stop because of the pandemic, inflation or political war. I want a proactive government less focused on forgiveness, leniency, and finger pointing. Stop reacting to things as they happen, and start strategizing for the future \u2013 that\u2019s how you\u2019ll connect with these \u201cordinary Americans\u201d you\u2019re always touting. \u2013 Rachel B., Ann Arbor, MI I am a librarian. I am a woman. I am bisexual. Any of these three facts about myself could and should make me more interested in this midterm election then most. I was brought up in the belief that it is my responsibility as a citizen to vote, and have missed very few since I turned 18. I sure won\u2019t be missing this one. My career has been about sharing stories and providing access to information to people who want or need it. We cannot as a society have equitable access to information without libraries and the freedom of those libraries to carry the materials which will allow people of color to see themselves and their stories represented. Without a means for LGBTQ+ youth and adults to access the information they need to remain healthy and stories to know they are not alone, even if their families are the ones isolating them. As a woman, I am terrified that I might get prosecuted if I need an abortion. I don\u2019t have many years yet, and have made the decision to talk to my doctor about a hysterectomy rather than take the risk. I am highly considering a major surgery because my state does not believe in my bodily autonomy. I'm a doctor. The law shouldn't force me to hurt my patients this way As a bisexual single woman, I would really like to have the right to marry if I fall in love with a woman and have it recognized in the state I live. I am scared I will lose that right. These three things are my personal reasons. However, I also have empathy toward people who are transgender and their families. The only people who should be making decisions about the medical care of the child are the parents and doctors of those children. Not the government. I believe in voting equality. The moves against allowing equitable access to the polls is terrifying. I believe the gun control, climate control, and health care legislation which were passed were a good start, but do not go far enough. And most of all, while I don\u2019t like the turn our country has taken for the last several years, I do love my country. I want it to live up to its potential. I want to be proud of it. So I will use my voice this November. \u2013 Jennifer F., Houston, TX I wish I didn\u2019t have to vote out of fear. I\u2019m a Democrat, but I\u2019d always consider a Republican candidate if they had good ideas. Not any more. The Republican Party has fully embraced Trumpism, along with its racism, misogyny, homophobia, antisemitism, corruption, authoritarianism, cruelty and White Christian nationalism. In the past, I\u2019d be willing to accept a Republican government even if I disagreed with their policies. Now, I\u2019d feel unsafe in my own country if they took over. I don\u2019t just want the Republicans to lose these midterms. I want them to be utterly crushed with the hope they become a true political party again. \u2013 Matthew S., Orange County, CA I have been a voting Republican for over 40 years. The Democrats can\u2019t give money away fast enough and are saddling us with outrageous debt, but the Trump et al takeover of the Republican party leaves me no good choices. I can vote for the irresponsible or vote for the crazy. I will vote straight-ticket Democrat knowing full well the damage it does do to our economy against the current tribe that has taken the Republican party \u2013 and whether through intent or stupidity or personal avarice \u2013 to a place that threatens the very fabric of our country. One day, I expect our grand-children will learn about Trumpism and McCarthyism and question how we fell for the same old fear mongering so badly again\u2026.. I pray for the return of civility and rational discourse to our political process. \u2013 Keith W., Pace, Florida The most direct impact today is the mere cost of living. My husband and I have been married 52 years and struggle every month to pay the bills and eat. We do know we are luckier than a lot of seniors though. Neither of us blames a political party on inflation. The country was basically shut down for 2 years, what did we expect? The real stuff of nightmares though is everything else. The loss of rights, the crazed fanaticism to a cult leader, children getting gunned down, the attack on the Capitol \u2026. I still cry when I think of it. The emotional toll is far worse than not being able to afford a bag of potato chips! The hopelessness of the political climate, racism, book banning, and pure lunacy is what chips away at one\u2019s mental health. I long for the day when once again I can be truly proud of our flag. I hope I can live long enough. \u2013 Linda C., Phoenix, AZ As a California resident, I feel super conflicted about the midterms. On the one hand, national issues like the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the disgusting gun violence are exceedingly urgent and motivating to help halt any \u201cred wave.\u201d On the other hand, local politics have me extremely wary of voting for Democrats in city and state elections due to crime, homeless and the infuriating performance of out-of-control liberal DAs. Living in Los Angeles in 2022 is quite different from when I grew up here. I want to support Democrats nationally and ensure they hold the House and Senate, so they can protect my civil liberties and women\u2019s rights \u2013 but California is a mess right now and it\u2019s really difficult to justify an all out \u201cgo Democrats\u201d rallying cry when the status of my home state and city, which more directly impacts my day-to-day life, is so dire. Likewise for New York CIty, which i called home for 10 years \u2013 it\u2019s even scarier watching what is going on out there! My international friends now send me messages of sympathy and literal fear for my safety. \u2013 Trevor L., Los Angeles, CA \u200b\u200bI used to vote across party lines. That ended when the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade. I think the current Republican Party has gone off the rails. They have taken away basic fundamental rights for women managing their own health. Women\u2019s reproductive health belongs between her and her provider. This is beyond dangerous! Opinion: The conflicts in a post-Roe America are just beginning I am sick to my stomach about the loss of life that will occur because of a complete lack of understanding of medical conditions and pregnancy. Being pregnant is the most dangerous time for women of reproductive age. And yet old White men with no medical background continue to make medical decisions often based on myths for women. Delaying having children is a way for women to have children when they are mentally, financially and emotionally ready for children. To force pregnant women to carry to term is just wrong. For that reason I will not be voting for Republicans in the near future or at all. \u2013 Denise C., Hawaii As a registered Republican, I\u2019ve been frustrated generally by the party\u2019s support of individual \u201crights\u201d over the welfare of others, which if it continues, I feel will have a negative impact on our country as a whole. I am optimistic about the future, as I do believe that the majority of people will choose to do what is responsible for society as a whole. \u2013 Robert G., Elkhart, Indiana As a college student I have been most impacted by the cost of university education and the effects of Covid-19. This combined with mental health issues has made life post-high school much more difficult. I will be voting in November for candidates who will push for the reduction of college tuition and expand health care programs for low income Americans. \u2013 Nathan L., Ann Arbor, MI Something has to be done about college tuition. I attended Penn State from 1979-1983 and owed a total of $7500 when I graduated. I paid that loan off. I then went back to college to add another teaching certificate to address a critical need. I only took seven classes and owed $21,000. Until we rein in the cost of college, students graduating will continue to have insurmountable debt. I was lucky and graduated during Covid. I have had the luck of a part-time evening teaching position that let me pay down that student loan to $10,000 because I didn\u2019t have to pay interest. Why aren\u2019t we addressing the problem of high cost and lack of funding by the federal government to keep the cost of college down? \u2013 P.P., Pine City, NY We moved to the UK because we were afraid of our kids being shot at school. We will never go back with the US as divided as it is. \u2013 Lauren A., Surrey, United Kingdom Opinion: How a bullet fired by a stranger almost killed and forever changed me As a physician who cares for a rural community I have been greatly impacted. I have voted Republican, Independent, Green and Democratic over my lifetime. I will never vote Republican again based on the party\u2019s extreme change from its historic roots and the direct threat they caused to my personal life and my family\u2019s. Republicans lost a voter forever based on the handling of Covid. It has affected my work significantly. My patients and friends have died listening to non-evidence-based advice. They made it worse with abortion rights. My patients\u2019 lives have been altered. My ability to care for my community now might make me a criminal just for following the evidence-based recommendations to properly care for my patients. Factor in climate change, which affects all the farmers I care for and their ability to feed their own families and all of ours, and it has all been sad to continue to watch and listen to. Hopefully politicians can do what they say they will: Keep government out of my exam rooms. \u2013 Dr. Mike, rural northern Wisconsin Gun violence. I have not been personally impacted in that neither me nor my family have been victims. But it is so hard to send your babies to school every morning knowing that it might be the last time you see them. And the powers that be in my state will not do anything about it. \u2013 Joe W., El Paso, TX While I worry about epidemics and inflation, I do not dwell on them because I believe there is very little we can do proactively about them. I see those issues as reactive ones. All I can do is get my vaccinations and watch my spending. However, out of control rent increases scare me to death. I am a retired senior who will be priced out of my apartment within a year. Gun violence (coupled with our systemic racism) is my top issue. We can do something about it. Why would any clear-thinking adult believe that any private citizen needs an assault rifle? So much posturing and so many sound bites while innocents die every day. A woman\u2019s right to choose is between her doctor and herself. Period. I do not understand why a very vocal minority make such a big deal about this when a majority of Americans support her right to choose.  My hopes for the future: a kinder, gentler place to live and let live, including a greener planet. I used to ignore midterm and local elections. Never again. I vote now in every contest, I research the candidates, I use my unaffiliated status to work the others\u2019 primaries, and I shall vote Democratic until I can longer take a breath. \u2013 Vereen M., Morganton, NC I am a 65 year old, married White male with two college age children. Certainly, the cost of education is a major factor for our whole family right now and we hope our 529s will be sufficient to keep our children from having to take on significant debt. My biggest concern for the future, however, is how the balance in our culture between rights and responsibilities has gotten so far out of whack and how seething resentments drive so much of public discourse and policy and crowd out reasoned debate between people with legitimately differing views. That colors how all the issues listed here are being addressed. My biggest hope for the future, and source of optimism, is the young people I see taking ownership of critical issues, such as March for Our Lives or the students I read about recently who are taking it upon themselves to provide responsible and factual sex education to their peers that their schools won\u2019t do. \u2013 Jonathan A., Syracuse, NY My wife is planning to be a librarian and both of us are afraid of the violent threats against libraries by all of these right wing groups with their anti-diversity views. In our community a group of Proud Boys came and disrupted a library diversity event. The presenter had to escape through a back door. We are very afraid for our freedoms being quelled through violence by the very people who call themselves \u201cpatriots.\u201d \u2013 Eric G., Wilmington, NC",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. If former Saturday Night Live great and actor Bill Murray wasn\u2019t hired as a technical adviser to Israel\u2019s Central Elections Committee, he surely might have been. Based on pre-election polling it seemed that Israel was headed for yet another Groundhog Day-style hung election for the fifth time in just short of four years. But this election seems to have produced (final figures won\u2019t be available until week\u2019s end) what the previous four could not: a majority for Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu and his allies and the likely emergence of the most right-wing government in Israel\u2019s history. Indeed, the biggest star in the new political firmament wasn\u2019t Netanyahu but the extremist Itamar Ben Gvir, whose bloc Religious Zionism is now the third largest in the Knesset. Here are four things you should know about this election and what may lie ahead. Like its four predecessors, this election had one central fault line, if not organizing principle. Are you for or against the return of Netanyahu? Love him or despise him, Netanyahu, at 73, has been the longest governing prime minister in Israel\u2019s history. Even under indictment and on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu is still the most consequential politician on the Israeli scene today and is on the cusp of perhaps his greatest triumph \u2013 returning to the prime ministry with a majority. For Netanyahu this election was truly existential. Had he failed to secure a governing majority \u2013 one that is likely to pass legislation to postpone or even cancel his trial \u2013 he may well have had to face the consequences of a guilty verdict or a plea bargain that would have driven him away from politics. But Netanyahu\u2019s victory wasn\u2019t just an \u201call about me\u201d headline. It reflects and consolidates trend lines that have been in evidence for quite some time. Likud is the most stable and durable political party in Israel\u2019s system. Netanyahu is its master and Israel is a nation now shaped more by the right wing \u2013 and perhaps its most extreme elements \u2013 than at any point in its history. The left and center-left in Israel once dominated by the iconic Labor Party, the driving political force for the first three decades of independence, has been reduced to a shadow of its former self with just a handful of seats in the Knesset. And while the center-left and right bloc of the caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid made a respectable showing \u2013 perhaps even garnering more votes \u2013 the fracturing of the left and the Arab vote gave the advantage to the more cohesive and disciplined Netanyahu bloc. Indeed, without overdramatizing matters, Netanyahu\u2019s victory now introduces a cult of personalities \u2013 Netanyahu and Ben Gvir \u2013 that will strengthen the forces of radical nationalism; populism and an us against them mentality dividing and polarizing the country. And if the Netanyahu government succeeds in restricting the powers of the Israel Supreme Court, imposing control over judicial appointments, deepening the grip of Jewish law over public life and reversing the court\u2019s decision to strike down legislation aimed at legalizing West Bank settlements, Israeli democracy will be fundamentally undermined, reinforcing the forces of illiberalism, ethnocentrism and disrespect for the rule of law. Israel has been drifting rightward for years. Indeed according to analyst Tamar Hermann of the Israeli Democracy Institute, a full 60% of the Israeli electorate is right-wing; 12-14% identifies as left and the remainder are in the so-called center. But while polling had predicted that the Religious Zionism \u2013 a bloc of three extremist parties that collectively embody a racist, Jewish supremacist, anti-Arab and homophobic view \u2013 would do well in the election, the extent of their success was nonetheless stunning. Religious Zionism doubled its numbers from the 2021 election and Gvir, the clear star of the bloc, attracted new voters \u2013 and according to exit polls, raised national turnout by about 6%. A far-right surge is set to put Netanyahu back in power. Who are his extremist allies? It\u2019s also going to prove a stunning moment for Netanyahu who midwifed this unholy alliance in an effort to maximize his chances of securing the magic number of 60-plus seats to form a government. It\u2019s hardly a coincidence that one of the parties in this bloc led by Bezalel Smotrich has authored a plan to reform (read emasculate) the judicial system and ensure that Netanyahu is immune from prosecution. The new prime minister is now beholden to these extremists and the two ultra-Orthodox parties who will have a long list of demands. Indeed, Likud polled 31 seats, the right wingers and ultras have as many or more, effectively making him a minority within his own government. More than that Netanyahu now has a partner-rival in Ben Gvir who, at 46, is just starting his rise in Israeli politics. It should surprise no one if Netanyahu tries to reach out to the more centrist party of Benny Gantz and Gideon Saar to join his coalition to \u201csave the nation\u201d in an effort to check Ben Gvir or at a minimum to lessen his extremist demands. One might be forgiven for thinking that this kind of narrow right-wing government might not last. But there may be more that binds this coalition together than divides it. The two Orthodox parties have been out of power and are eager to secure support for their religious schools and institutions. The Ben Gvir-dominated Religious Zionism bloc sees participation in the government as a way to legitimize his movement, expand his base and his own political horizons. He began his election victory speech by declaring, \u201cI\u2019m still not prime minister.\u201d And Netanyahu surely will try mightily to keep this coalition together in order to secure his get-out-of-jail-free card through legislation. How will this government actually behave? It\u2019s safe to say as Israel\u2019s 75th anniversary approaches next year, it won\u2019t bring the country any closer to tackling the domestic and foreign policy challenges it faces and will almost certainly make them worse. At home, Israel will be increasingly polarized, with an independent judiciary and rule of law under serious threat. At home, Israel will be increasingly polarized, with an independent judiciary and rule of law under serious threat. Aaron David Miller Netanyahu has proven himself inherently risk-averse when it comes to acting on matters of war and peace. And he\u2019ll try and keep Ben Gvir far away from influencing Israel\u2019s national security; and push back on his demands to disband the Palestinian Authority, annex the West Bank and expel Palestinians. But there will be more settlements and support for settlers; more effort to consolidate control over Jerusalem; relations with Israel\u2019s Arab citizens will likely deteriorate with fewer resources for their community and if there\u2019s a serious confrontation with Palestinians in the West Bank or in Jerusalem the odds of it morphing into a conflict between Israeli Jews and Arabs will likely grow. There will be some constraints on the government\u2019s behavior. Netanyahu is certainly not interested in a confrontation with Hamas or Hezbollah. He\u2019ll want to preserve the recently concluded maritime boundary agreement with Lebanon, maintain the Abraham Accords with the UAE and Bahrain and to lay the groundwork for relations with Saudi Arabia. Neither President Joe Biden nor Netanyahu will seek out a confrontation. The White House has already put out the following statement. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the Israeli government on our shared interests and values.\u201d Both are far too busy with other matters to want such a problematic distraction. But even without being tethered to the extremist Ben Gvir, Netanyahu\u2019s relations with Biden would have been difficult as their views on settlements, treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and building in Jerusalem would have clashed. On Iran, Netanyahu\u2019s rhetoric will intensify. And should the Biden Administration have an opportunity to revive the Iran nuclear accord, Netanyahu will resume his earlier campaign in 2015 to make common cause with Republicans to oppose it.  Indeed, Netanyahu, much like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, would be much more comfortable with the return of Donald Trump or his Republican avatar. In short, with his dance card already full with matters foreign and domestic, the return of Netanyahu, let alone tied to an extremist right wing coalition partner likely to roil the already tense situation with Palestinians \u2013 is something Biden surely didn\u2019t want or need.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN. With midterm elections approaching in November, Democrats have surprisingly good reasons to feel optimistic. Republicans have reminded voters of how bad things can get with them in charge, as a spate of unpopular laws go into effect in conservative states that criminalize abortion and put the lives of pregnant women at risk, not to mention attempt to legally force legions of Americans into unwanted parenthood. Since recent estimates from the Brookings Institution show that raising a child has never been more expensive, that reality hits particularly hard for voters who must now consider whether forced parenthood comports with their vision for America. At the same time, the Republican frontrunner for the 2024 presidential nomination and the undisputed head of the GOP \u2013 former President Donald Trump \u2013 is the subject of an investigation over his handling of classified documents and potential violations of the Espionage Act and other laws. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. What was initially believed to be a Republican sweep in November now has a bluer outlook, and for that, the GOP can thank itself. But Democrats shouldn\u2019t get too confident. We are living in an America that is crueler, more divided and more despairing than at any point in my lifetime. And while those conditions can lend themselves to positive and even transformative social change, they often do the opposite, pushing populations toward bigotry, hyper-nationalism and reactionary politics. Democrats are going to have a hard time harnessing voter energy toward positive change. They can, however, make the case that a Republican victory would be disastrous. To do that, they should lean into touting popular policies they will implement and emphasizing real threats posed by a GOP win. They need to make the case about what they would do to counter right-wing extremism. Ditto voting rights and the threat to democracy itself. Democrats need to come to voters not just with dire and accurate warnings, but a plan of attack beyond \u201cvote for us.\u201d When President Joe Biden pointed to the \u201csemi-fascism\u201d of the Republican Party\u2019s rightmost flank, he was not exaggerating. And while plenty of Americans are understandably fed up a Democratic Party that holds the levers of power has failed to achieve goals crucial to its overall agenda, Biden is also right that this election is for nothing less than the soul of the country. And as long as much of the Republican Party keeps walking down its current antidemocratic path, the same will be true of subsequent elections as well. Opinion: Jared Kushner settles a few scores While voters handed Biden a victory in 2020, the last two years have been fairly lackluster. Biden did offer some important improvements in people\u2019s lives, most notably extending important economic lifelines to get Americans through Covid shutdowns. And just this month, Biden also announced a significant student loan relief program, unshackling a great many graduates from up to $10,000 ($20,000 for Pell grant recipients) of student debt and reining in predatory interest rates. But thanks in large part to congressional recalcitrance, including from two moderate Democratic senators in Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, the Biden administration has not been able to go as far as many Democratic voters would have liked on some of our country\u2019s most pressing needs, from universal pre-K to paid parental leave to legislation to curb climate change that goes far beyond what the Inflation Reduction Act will do. While economists may quibble about who or what is at fault for our odd economic reality \u2013 inflation coupled with healthy jobs reports \u2013 Americans are feeling the pinch on their pocketbooks. Add that to a growing sense of pervasive disorder and discord, and the reality that rates of some serious violent crimes shot up during Covid-19 after years of decline, and Democrats had good reason to be worried about how they might fare in November. But then, Republicans got what they wanted: A Supreme Court that stripped the broad right to abortion from American women and conservative state governments that immediately outlawed the procedure with few (and in some cases, no) exceptions for rape victims, fetal anomaly or a pregnant woman\u2019s health. Extreme anti-abortion politics may dominate among Republican Party elected officials, but they are vastly unpopular nationwide, and these Republican-penned laws go far further in restricting abortion rights than even most Republicans say they want. Opinion: Businesses strike back as DeSantis criticizes corporate America Stories now abound of women seriously injured or nearly dying because of these laws. And while Republican-led states are forcing pregnant women to give birth against their will, the cost of raising a child has ticked up to more than $300,000 \u2013 and that\u2019s before paying for college. States that outlaw or likely will outlaw abortion are much, much worse than states with liberal abortion laws when it comes to support for women and children, and even whether a woman and her child are likely to make it through childbirth at all. Perhaps as a result of these extreme attacks on women\u2019s right and the immediately apparent and dire consequences, huge numbers of women have registered to vote since the Supreme Court issued its decision, portending a large-scale female rejection of anti-abortion Republican candidates. Republican voters also got what they wanted when they cast their ballots for Trump in 2016, and the Republican establishment largely got in line; many of those who initially warned of the dangers Trump posed became pathetic sycophants singing his praises, and the very few who stuck to their principles have largely been voted out of office. Trump misled no one about who he was: A ruthless businessman who always put his own interests above all else; a man who did not believe the rules, legal or otherwise, applied to him; a demagogue whose campaign was largely bereft of policy but heavy on reactionary rhetoric. But that hardly makes the midterms Democrats\u2019 to lose. The same landscape of despair and dissatisfaction that make Republican anti-abortion laws so galling is also a landscape in which far-right movements often thrive. You see this in views creeping more into the conservative mainstream, with right-wing commentators suggesting that only a small group (wealthy White men) should have the right to vote, Republican candidates for office publicly romanticizing violence or fantasizing about murdering the opposition and even Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warning that people will \u201criots in the streets\u201d if Trump is held legally accountable. This is the ideology underpinning so much of Trumpism: That there are \u201creal\u201d Americans who are deserving of all of our nation\u2019s privileges and protections and the less-real ones who are not. That can be an awfully tempting view for those who believe they are part of the in group, who are searching for a simple explanation for the complicated forces that have shaped their lives, and who need some sense of greater purpose \u2013 and may find it in being an armed thug for Trump. It is also creeping awfully close to fascism.  When Biden made the point, though, that a propensity for \u201csemi-fascism\u201d drives reactionaries toward the Republican Party, conservatives howled \u2013 despite decades of calling just about every Democrat, including the extremely moderate Biden, a \u201ccommunist\u201d or a \u201csocialist.\u201d The hypocrisy is indeed a bit rich \u2013 right up there with the people whose favorite campaign chant was \u201clock her up\u201d now threatening street riots if the investigation of Trump ends in criminal charges. It\u2019s equal parts absurd and dangerous. The stakes were high in 2020; they are high in November; they will be high again in 2024, unless the Republican Party moderates itself and decides it would like to participate in a multiparty representative democracy, rather than dominate in a single-party state. But there is little indication that Republicans will course correct. While they continue their turn toward a dangerous anti-democratic ideology, Biden\u2019s \u201csemi-fascism\u201d characterization was, if anything, too kind. He would have been more correct to drop the \u201csemi\u201d and call violent authoritarianism exactly what it is.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In the 1970s, when British scientist James Lovelock was developing his notion that all species \u201cfrom whales to viruses and from oaks to algae\u201d combine with the planet itself to make up a single system sustaining life on Earth, he needed a name for the hypothesis. Lovelock\u2019s neighbor William Golding, the author of \u201cLord of the Flies,\u201d suggested the \u201cGaia theory,\u201d after the ancient Greek goddess of Earth. At first, Lovelock misheard him and thought he was proposing \u201cgyre,\u201d but the Gaia hypothesis would go on to stir decades of debate, influencing the emerging awareness of Earth as a planet endangered by climate change. In a 2011 speech, Lovelock explained that he wasn\u2019t \u201crelaxing into contented retirement\u201d because he was \u201cdeeply concerned about the probability of massively harmful climate change and the need to do something about it now.\u201d On Wednesday, a day after Lovelock\u2019s death on his 103rd birthday, a surprise announcement in Washington suggested that the US may be on the verge of doing \u201csomething about it now.\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia reached an agreement with his party\u2019s Senate leadership on a bill that begins to address the challenge of a changing climate. \u201cSpending $369 billion to fight climate change by investing in clean energy and reducing greenhouse emissions is a huge step forward,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer. \u201cThe deal, if it holds, is very big,\u201d David Wallace-Wells observed in the New York Times, \u201cseveral times as large as anything on climate the United States passed into law before.\u201d Its backers \u201care already calculating that it could reduce American carbon emissions by 40 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2030.\u201d It can\u2019t come too soon. In California, where fires are a natural \u201cway to prevent overgrowth of plants and brush,\u201d W. Kamau Bell wrote, the warming climate is altering the equation. \u201cFires are acting in unpredictable ways that firefighters can\u2019t prepare for due to climate change\u2026 Nine of the 10 most destructive wildfires in California history have happened in the last 10 years, while \u2018fire season\u2019 is getting longer due to the effects of climate change, including higher temperatures and intensifying drought.\u201d For all the despair about a polarized Congress\u2019 inability to act, President Joe Biden has scored successes on issues such as infrastructure and gun safety, in addition to the CHIPS bill, which will boost US semiconductor production. That legislation is a major step toward supporting \u201ccritical industries operating on our shores,\u201d wrote Oren Cass. \u201cBetter late than never, American policymakers have awakened to the threat posed by the loss of global leadership in such a vital technology, especially if an adversary like China takes the reins from the US. The chip shortages that emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic have further underscored the risks of relying on foreign supplies.\u201d Codifying same-sex marriage and reforming the Electoral Count Act could follow, wrote William A. Galston in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cAlthough partisan polarization is wider and deeper than it was a generation ago, the center hasn\u2019t vanished. There is still an appetite for common-sense responses to widely recognized problems.\u201d \u201cSurprisingly, in small but significant ways, (Biden) is winning,\u201d wrote Fareed Zakaria in the Washington Post. \u201cIf more bipartisan bills get passed and if legislators don\u2019t get punished for working across party lines \u2013 even get rewarded for it \u2013 that might begin to shift some of the incentives and reduce the toxicity in Washington.\u201d Julian Zelizer wrote that if the Inflation Reduction Act agreed to by Manchin \u201cgoes through, Biden will be able to boast that he has delivered on one of the most basic promises of his 2020 campaign \u2013 that he has the ability and willingness to govern. Besides the fact that Biden seemed to Democrats like the antithesis of former President Donald Trump, voters were also supporting an old-fashioned senator who came to the Oval Office with decades of legislative experience and who believed in the art of governing.\u201d How much would passing the bill help Biden\u2019s party avoid a drubbing in November\u2019s midterm election? SE Cupp noted that \u201cmuch of what\u2019s included in the massive $739 billion Inflation Reduction Act isn\u2019t immediately tangible for most voters.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 prospects in November may depend more on \u201chow voters are feeling.\u201d Gas prices are coming down, but recent government statistics show inflation remains at the highest levels in 40 years. A second quarter of negative GDP growth, which the Commerce Department reported last week, fueled debate among economists and politicians about whether the nation is in a recession. \u201cProgress against today\u2019s high inflation won\u2019t come as quickly as anyone wants,\u201d wrote David Wilcox for CNN Business Perspectives. \u201cBut a year from now, inflation will have come down substantially from its current level, and by two to three years from now, it should be in the neighborhood of 2%. Everyone will be a little less angry.\u201d For more: Sen. Chris Murphy: Overhauling this 1887 law could protect US elections Gavin Smith: The GOP\u2019s chance to show just how big their tent really is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene argued that the Republican Party should identify itself with the Christian nationalist movement, weeks after Rep. Lauren Boebert said, \u201cI\u2019m tired of this separation of church and state junk.\u201d Amanda Tyler, who heads the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, warned that \u201cChristian nationalism is a political ideology and cultural framework that merges Christian and American identities, distorting both the Christian faith and America\u2019s promise of religious freedom. It relies heavily on a false narrative of America as a \u2018Christian nation,\u2019 founded by Christians in order to privilege Christianity. This mythical history betrays the work of the framers to create a federal government that would remain neutral when it comes to religion, neither promoting nor denigrating it \u2013 a deliberate break with the state-established religions of the colonies.\u201d \u201cWe all have work to do because it\u2019s not just the relatively few self-proclaimed Christian nationalists we have to worry about,\u201d Tyler wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the way the ideology infects so much of American politics and American Christianity often without us even realizing it.\u201d Enter Merrick Garland. After months of criticism, the US attorney general spoke out forcefully on the question of investigating the effort to overturn the 2020 election. Asked by NBC\u2019s Lester Holt if the Justice Department would indict Trump if there was sufficient evidence, Garland said, \u201cWe will hold accountable anyone who was criminally responsible for attempting to interfere with the transfer, legitimate, lawful transfer of power from one administration to the next.\u201d Two of former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s closest aides recently testified before a federal grand jury, legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers noted. \u201cThere is still much we don\u2019t know \u2013 like whether Trump will ever face charges for his conduct around the 2020 election and January 6 \u2013 but it now appears almost certain that DOJ is actively investigating that conduct. For our country\u2019s sake, this is a good thing, as is the evident professionalism and integrity of the current Justice Department as it does so.\u201d As Scott Jennings wrote, \u201cFormer Vice President Mike Pence came to Washington, DC, this week with a message: the Republican Party must look forward, not backward, if it intends to win back the White House in 2024.\u201d  \u201cIt was a not-so-subtle dig at his old running mate, former President Donald Trump, whose next campaign will be motivated by relitigating the 2020 election, which he lost, and exacting revenge on those who didn\u2019t fall in line,\u201d observed Jennings. \u201cPence deserves enormous respect for his service to our country and our party, and for standing up to the mob on January 6. Pence may not be the Republican Party\u2019s savior in 2024, but his message may help clear a path for some other nominee who could move the party \u2013 and the country \u2013 forward, instead of backward.\u201d The editorial boards of two newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire came out against Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021. The New York Post\u2019s piece, headlined, \u201cTrump\u2019s silence on Jan. 6 is damning\u201d should be of particular concern to Trump, Dean Obeidallah wrote. \u201cThe conservative-leaning daily is not some random anti-MAGA publication; rather it gave Trump a full-throated endorsement when he ran for reelection in 2020 while saying a Joe Biden administration \u2018would be beholden to a socialist left.\u2019 The New York Post is a tabloid that reaches Trump voters where they are.\u201d The Wall Street Journal also excoriated Trump over January 6. Kara Alaimo: While Oz is stoking fear, Fetterman is making us laugh Paul Callan: Justice Alito\u2019s careless remarks about Prince Harry and Boris Johnson Frida Ghitis: How Pelosi could visit Taiwan without causing a foreign policy storm Michael Bociurkiw: Odesa used to be known for two things \u2013 the port and raucous hedonism Jill Filipovic: Why no state can ignore Florida\u2019s sex ed problem Melanie D.G.

Ray Liotta. Tony Sirico. James Caan. They played \u201cwise guys\u201d in iconic movie and television roles, and by a twist of fate, all died in the past several months. Also in their league was the English actor David Warner, who, like Sorvino, passed away last week. \u201cBoth frequently played imposing-to-intimidating men who even in relative repose conveyed implied threats,\u201d wrote Gene Seymour. He recalled that Sorvino played mob boss Paulie Cicero menacingly in \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d He \u201cwasn\u2019t exactly warm and fuzzy. Sorvino\u2019s Paulie loomed over finks, cops and colleagues alike with a frostiness thick enough to keep steaks in the next room from spoiling. In a salon teeming with motor-mouthed wise guys, Paulie was the one who just kept staring silently at the others.\u201d And yet, Paulie knew his way around a clove of garlic. In HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d Tony Sirico played a very different Paulie: \u201cPaulie Walnuts.\u201d The character was \u201cone of the more volatile of Jersey capo Tony Soprano\u2019s lieutenants who maintained a ferocious sense of justice and duty to his calling. Nothing icy or aloof about Sirico\u2019s Paulie in comparison to Sorvino\u2019s. If anything linked them both, it was a rough-hewn charm that almost \u2013 one stresses \u2018almost\u2019 \u2013 made them lovable.\u201d",

Follow her on Twitter. The views expressed here are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene explicitly labeled herself a Christian nationalist on Saturday. This shocking statement by a sitting member of Congress should serve as a wake-up call to everyone, and particularly, I believe, to Christians. \u201cWe need to be the party of nationalism and I\u2019m a Christian, and I say it proudly, we should be Christian nationalists,\u201d Greene said in an interview while attending the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in Florida on Saturday. Her self-avowal of Christian nationalism follows her claim last month that Christian nationalism is \u201cnothing to be afraid of,\u201d and that the \u201cmovement\u201d will solve school shootings and \u201csexual immorality\u201d in America. For years, I have been closely tracking Christian nationalism and sounding the alarm about it. Greene\u2019s recent comments mark an alarming shift in the public conversation about Christian nationalism. Until recently, the public figures who most embrace Christian nationalism in their rhetoric and policies have either denied its existence or claimed that those of us who are calling it out are engaging in name-calling. But Greene is evidently reading from a different script now \u2013 explicitly embracing the identity as her own and urging others to join her. She is not alone in doing so. Greene\u2019s embrace of Christian nationalism follows closely after troubling remarks from Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert: \u201cThe church is supposed to direct the government, the government is not supposed to direct the church,\u201d she said at a church two days before her primary election (and victory) in late June. \u201cI\u2019m tired of this separation of church and state junk.\u201d And as CNN has reported, public opinion polling shows that support for Christian nationalism is growing among Christians. Christian nationalism is a political ideology and cultural framework that merges Christian and American identities, distorting both the Christian faith and America\u2019s promise of religious freedom. It relies heavily on a false narrative of America as a \u201cChristian nation,\u201d founded by Christians in order to privilege Christianity. This mythical history betrays the work of the framers to create a federal government that would remain neutral when it comes to religion, neither promoting nor denigrating it \u2013 a deliberate break with the state-established religions of the colonies. An 'imposter Christianity' is threatening American democracy Though not new, Christian nationalism has been exploited in recent years by politicians like former President Donald Trump to further an \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality and send a message that only Christians can be \u201creal\u201d Americans. Growing support for Christian nationalism comes at a time when the political ideology behind it poses increasingly urgent threats to American democracy and to religious freedom. Perhaps the most chilling example of Christian nationalism came on the most public of world stages, from some Trump supporters during the January 6 insurrection. Earlier this year, Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty (BJC), the organization I lead, co-published the only comprehensive report documenting the role of Christian nationalism in coalescing and intensifying support for those who violently attacked the Capitol. I care about dismantling Christian nationalism both because I\u2019m a practicing Christian and because I\u2019m a patriotic American \u2013 and no, those identities are not the same. As Christians, we can\u2019t allow Greene, Boebert or Trump to distort our faith without a fight. We must speak loudly when our faith is used as a political tool, we must uproot it from our own churches and communities and we must form alliances with religious minorities and the nonreligious \u2013 who suffer the impact of Christian nationalism the most. Religion, and Christianity in particular, has flourished in America not because of government aid or favoritism, but for the opposite reason: religion\u2019s freedom from government control. Government involvement in religious affairs doesn\u2019t aid the free exercise of religion. And as Christians, we are called to love our neighbors rather than make them feel unwelcome in their own country. As historian Jemar Tisby has written, \u201c[to] follow Christ is to reject the Christian Nationalist ideology. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her allies can follow Jesus\u2019s teachings or the teachings of Christian Nationalism, but they cannot do both.\u201d Opinion: Brick by brick, the wall between religion and government is collapsing in America Christian nationalism, while pervasive and long-standing, cannot be normalized. I think Christians, who continue to make up a majority of Americans, have a special responsibility to step up at this critical moment to reject Christian nationalism. Christian lawmakers should choose a different path from Greene and Boebert by calling out Christian nationalism without ignoring their own faith and the religious pluralism that is a significant part of our country\u2019s identity. Christian nationalism runs wild in a society where its peddlers are the only ones talking about the role of Christianity in public life. Worse yet is a situation when the only detractors from Christian nationalism are the nonreligious, which furthers the false narrative that the only choices for our country are Christian nationalism or no religious expression at all.  Religious expression in the United States, from the founding era to the present, has been remarkably diverse, with a growing number of Americans who are not religiously affiliated. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult for Christian lawmakers who hold very different policy views to reject Christian nationalism. Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger responded to Boebert\u2019s comments by calling them out and clarifying that \u201cI say this as a Christian.\u201d Yet the Republican Party is increasingly accepting of Christian nationalist appeals, such as Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano. The party of former President George W. Bush \u2013 who rightly affirmed during the immediate aftermath of 9/11 that \u201cWe do not fight Islam\u201d \u2013 has given way to a party dominated by Trump. \u201cAs long as we are confident and united, the tyrants we are fighting do not stand a chance. Because we are Americans and Americans kneel to God, and God alone,\u201d Trump said on Saturday at the same Turning Point USA Student Action Summit where Greene also appeared.  Christian lawmakers don\u2019t need to erase their faith from politics. My fellow Baptist, Georgia Democrat Sen. Rev. Raphael Warnock, has modeled what it looks like for a pastor to serve in Congress without insisting on a privileged place for Christianity in law and society. Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford, a former Baptist youth pastor, and Delaware Democrat Sen. Chris Coons, who was an ordained elder in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), have found ways to work together out of their common Christian concerns. It\u2019s not just Christian political leaders that need to do better, it\u2019s all of us. In 2019, I joined a group of prominent Christian leaders in launching the Christians Against Christian Nationalism campaign. More than 25,000 Christians have joined the campaign as we seek to elevate an alternative Christian public witness. We all have work to do because it\u2019s not just the relatively few self-proclaimed Christian nationalists we have to worry about; it\u2019s the way the ideology infects so much of American politics and American Christianity often without us even realizing it. American Christians can and should be self-critical about the ways our faith and our country have been influenced by Christian nationalism, and we need to come together to loudly reject those who would embrace it as their identity and as a policy direction for the country. An earlier version of this op-ed included an incorrect date for the launch of Christians Against Christian Nationalism campaign, which began in 2019.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Arundhati Roy is the author of \u201cThe God of Small Things,\u201d which won the Booker Prize in 1997 and \u201cThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness,\u201d which was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2017. Her collected political writing has been published as \u201cMy Seditious Heart\u201d (2018) and \u201cAzadi\u201d (2020). She lives in New Delhi. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN. When two spokespeople from India\u2019s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made derogatory comments about the Prophet Mohammed last month, it prompted an international firestorm. The incident led to protests among India\u2019s Muslim minority in several states. Some Muslim-majority nations summoned their India ambassadors. India\u2019s foreign ministry said the comments did not reflect the views of the government, and the officials involved \u2013 one of whom later withdrew her remarks \u2013 faced disciplinary action. But for India\u2019s 200 million Muslims, these comments were not an isolated incident. Rather, they were the culmination of the BJP\u2019s \u201cengineering hatred of a common enemy,\u201d says bestselling Indian author Arundhati Roy. Indian officials demolish several houses after protests over anti-Islam remarks \u201cIndia\u2019s tragedy is not that it\u2019s the worst place in the world \u2013 it\u2019s that we are on our way there. We\u2019re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMany, many of my beloved friends \u2013 poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists \u2013 are in prison, most of them charged under a dreaded law called the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, all of them for speaking up for minorities, Dalits and forest-dwellers facing displacement and state terror. \u201cAmong them are people I consider to be India\u2019s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means. What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking?\u201d writes Roy. In this email interview with CNN Opinion, Roy says Indian politics has something in common with the US Capitol riots, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is stoking hatred, and talks about who the real power in India lies with. CNN: What does this incident involving BJP officials\u2019 comments about the Prophet Mohammed reveal about Indian politics today? Roy: It reveals how successfully the clear and present existential threat posed by Hindu nationalism in India has been masked by the face it presents to the outside world. You know the people in strange clothes, the man in furs and antlers who stormed the US Capitol? We\u2019re being ruled by their equivalent here. The difference is that they are not a collection of random lunatics. They are members of the most powerful organization in India \u2013 the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), whose founding ideologues openly admired Hitler and likened the Muslims of India to the Jews of Germany. RSS is the real power in India. CNN: What is the connection between the BJP and RSS? Roy: The ruling party, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), considered to be one of the richest political parties in the world, is only the front office of the RSS. Founded in 1925, the RSS, traditionally controlled by a handful of Brahmins, now has millions of members including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been a member since his teenage years, and most of his cabinet ministers. It has its own vast militia, its own schools, labor unions and women\u2019s organizations. It\u2019s not a political party, it\u2019s something of a shape-shifter, a master of double-speak, its sources of funding are amorphous and leave no legal trail, it works through an array of affiliates, but it\u2019s a nation within a nation. The RSS believes that India should be declared a Hindu nation, just as Pakistan, Iran and several countries in the Persian Gulf are Islamic nations, just as Israel is legally the \u201cnation-state of the Jewish people.\u201d In fact, the RSS believes in what it calls \u201cAkhand Bharat,\u201d a sort of fantasy that is futuristic and ancient all at once \u2013 a future Ancient India which includes Pakistan and Bangladesh which will be conquered and subject to Hindu rule. To flatten India\u2019s mind-boggling religious, socialand subnational identities, more diverse than all of Europe, into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process. It means setting aside the constitution and undoing the very idea of India. First in the line of fire is the Muslim community. Close behind are Christians \u2013 a tiny minority that is also being brutalized. Last year alone there were more than 400 attacks on Christians. Churches have been vandalized, priests and nuns beaten up, their congregations threatened and humiliated. In the last two national elections, in 2014 and 2019, the BJP has shown that it can win a solid majority in the national parliament without the votes of India\u2019s 200-million-strong Muslim community. That has effectively resulted in a sort of disenfranchisement and political isolation of Muslims, which is extremely dangerous. Opinion: In the world's largest democracy, 'looking Muslim' could cost your life There is also a new anti-Muslim citizenship law, a sort of refugee-manufacturing policy in which those who cannot produce a mandated set of \u201clegacy papers,\u201d which few people have, can find themselves deprived of citizenship. Nearly 2 million people in the state of Assam have already been struck off the National Register of Citizens. Massive detention centers for those who have been stripped of citizenship are being constructed all over the country. But isolating Muslims is not enough. Creating an artificial majority out of a very diverse Hindu community that consists of thousands of castes and ethnicities is equally important if the BJP is to remain in power. The cement for that is engineering hatred of a common enemy. This requires an incremental ratcheting up of bigotry. Apart from the mass killings and lynching of Muslims by Hindu vigilantes in recent years, we have the steady drumbeat of hatred and outlandish disinformation beamed into peoples\u2019 homes by approximately 400 TV channels and countless newspapers. On social media handles viewed by millions of people there are open calls for the genocide of Muslims \u2013 and videos demonstrating how it should be done. We regularly see provocative demonstrations by thousands of sword-wielding Hindu men marching through areas in which Muslims live. The deeply disrespectful comments about Prophet Mohammed made by a BJP spokeswoman on national TV this May was a part of this constituency-building exercise. As was the unconscionable bulldozing by municipal authorities of the homes of Muslims who dared to come out in protest. To flatten India\u2019s mind-boggling religious, social, and subnational identities\u2026 into the strict hierarchy of a moribund, caste-bound Hindu nation is an unimaginably violent process Arundhati Roy Some of the protestors publicly called for beheadings and hanging and asking for a blasphemy law which the BJP would probably be more than happy to pass and use to silence its critics in swifter and more deadly ways. These individuals helped to confirm every deeply held prejudice about Muslims that the Hindu Right works so hard to perpetuate. As a concession to international outrage, the BJP has suspended its spokeswoman, Nupur Sharma, but she has been openly embraced by its cadre. The polarization has worked in the BJP\u2019s favor. CNN: And what does Prime Minister Narendra Modi have to do with it? Roy: Modi has made no comment whatsoever about the spokeswoman or the protests. A standard tactic of his. In situations like this, his followers, correctly I believe, read his silence as support. Although he increasingly positions himself as a messiah, he is an RSS man, and he knows that the organization is grooming other leaders who are waiting in the wings. But for now, he is the uncontested figurehead. Modi made his political debut in October 2001. He was appointed, not elected, chief minister of the state of Gujarat. It was just weeks after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. The world was convulsed by Islamophobia. It was the perfect political climate for the RSS. A few months later, in February 2002, following an act of arson in which a railway carriage carrying Hindu pilgrims was burnt, there was a brutal pogrom against Muslims in the villages and towns of Gujarat. It lasted for weeks. While the police watched, more than a thousand people were slaughtered in broad daylight, women were gang-raped and burnt alive, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes. Subsequently the murderers were caught on camera boasting of their deeds. Many spoke of how they were inspired and protected by Modi. Modi was unapologetic and came to be known as \u201cHindu Hriday Samrat\u201d \u2013 the Emperor of Hindu Hearts. Soon after the 2002 massacre, he called for state elections and won with a massive majority. He has never looked back since \u2013 he was elected Chief Minister of Gujarat for three terms and in 2014 was elected prime minister. And we in India have begun to look at massacres and hatefulness against Muslims as an integral part of election campaigns. During Modi\u2019s tenure as Gujarat Chief Minster, Hitler made it into a school textbook published by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks as an inspirational leader. CNN: Over the years, Modi\u2019s popularity and his brand of politics has not waned. Why is that? Roy: For the same reasons that studies of the algorithms of Facebook and Twitter show that hatefulness gets far more traction than decency. Miserable people, oppressed people, unemployed people, people living in crushing poverty are voting themselves into further hellishness, their sunken eyes fixed on the object of their hate. After Modi\u2019s shocking display of callous incompetence during the pandemic \u2013 the sudden lockdown in the first wave that led to millions of stranded workers many of who had to walk thousands of miles home to their villages, the millions of deaths in the second wave \u2013 some still shake their heads in sorrowful awe and say, \u201cWithout Modi, it would have been worse.\u201d They\u2019ve swallowed the story they\u2019ve been fed about themselves, about their own lives. Meanwhile Modi has zero accountability. He has never addressed a single press conference in all his years as prime minister. All we get are staged performances and photo ops. CNN: What has contributed to this situation where the Modi government feels immune from any international reaction or action? Roy: I don\u2019t think it is immune at all. On the contrary, our globe-trotting, head-of-state-hugging prime minister cares deeply about international opinion. None of us have ever seen him hug a fellow Indian. The optics of his foreign trips are carefully curated. His millions of followers refer to him as \u201cVishwa-Guru,\u201d the Guru of the Whole World. 'We have been living in terror': Muslims in New Delhi say they are being targeted Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson have all indulged him. International action and reaction is only a game of pragmatism and expediency. It has to do with trade and geopolitics, race, religion and ethnicity, and very little with values and morality. If India is buying a fleet of fighter planes from, say, France, it knows that lynching and a little mass murder will, at most, get a delicate finger-wag. A big market is excellent insurance against moral censure. Right now, foreign relations are a little tricky for India because of the Ukraine war and India\u2019s proximity to Russia. So, India\u2019s crimes in Kashmir and this very violent form of Hindu nationalism is coming under a little scrutiny. But these are all just bargaining chips in the Great Game. Sorry to sound so cynical, but I am. CNN: How should India\u2019s international Muslim trading partners respond? (And the world, for that matter?) Roy: Most of the countries that you refer to as India\u2019s \u201cMuslim trading partners\u201d have long ago given up any pretense of democracy or diversity. They are already at the destination that Modi and the BJP are trying to drag India toward. The destination that we dread to arrive at, the theocratic state. India\u2019s tragedy is not that it\u2019s the worst place in the world \u2013 it\u2019s that we are on our way there. We\u2019re burning down our house. India is an experiment that is failing dangerously. Failing because our elected leaders are blinded by hate \u2013 and crippled by a severe lack of intelligence, which is the more dangerous thing. The consequences will be unimaginable. As for what the rest of the world can do, all one can hope for is that people pay attention and form an informed opinion. And realize that their profits from this immense \u201cmarket\u201d will dry up if the market ceases to exist. The Indian economy is in a lot of trouble. Wealthy people, businesses big and small, have begun to flee. They are good and accurate weather vanes. CNN: Is India truly the world\u2019s largest democracy? Roy: A democracy doesn\u2019t just mean having regular elections. You cannot be a democracy when 200 million people who constitute a religious minority are expected to live without rights. When you can lynch them, kill them, incarcerate them, economically and socially boycott them, bulldoze their homes with complete immunity and threaten to strip them of citizenship. When the murderers and lynchers can aspire to move swiftly up the political ladder. CNN: The damage done to Indian democracy \u2013 is it reversible? Roy: The systematic indoctrination of people on the scale on which it has taken place over decades is hard to reverse. Every institution that is supposed to make up the system of checks and balances has been hollowed out, repurposed and deployed against people as a weapon of Hindu nationalism. In terms of political opposition, there are political parties that have successfully opposed the BJP at the state level in Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, but opposition is virtually non-existent at the national level. The whole system of elections has been gamed. You can win a huge majority of seats even without anything close to a majority of actual votes. In India, we have a first-past-the-post, multi-party democracy. This means that even if you get say only 20% of the vote in a constituency, as long as its higher than your closest rival, you win. A rich party can put up spurious candidates to split the votes. But that\u2019s just one trick in a whole bag of tricks. And, anyway, how do you woo an indoctrinated population? By proving that you are a better, prouder Hindu? Nobody can beat the BJP at that game. And right now, that\u2019s the only game in town. As far as mainstream politics goes. So, no, I don\u2019t believe the damage is reversible. I believe we will be broken and then reborn. Change will only come when and if at all an accepting, gullible, fatalistic people realize what\u2019s being done to them. And then it will come suddenly, and from the street. Not from the system. Until then\u2026 God help us. CNN: What changes have you personally experienced that echo the changes taking place in India at large? Roy: To begin with, many, many of my beloved friends \u2013 poets, writers, professors, lawyers, human rights activists and journalists \u2013 are in prison. Among them are people I consider to be India\u2019s most important minds. It makes one wonder what living as a free person in the time of fascism means. What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? What does it mean to be considered a \u2018success\u2019 when the world is failing and everything you care about is being decimated? What is the moral way to be? The moral thing to do? I am one of those unfortunate people who saw this coming decades ago. I said so. I wrote so. At the time that made me something of a crazy outlier \u2013 one of those people who sets off a fire alarm right when the party\u2019s going really well and everyone\u2019s happy. In some ways it un-homed (not un-housed) me in all sorts of ways, literally and metaphorically \u2013 which is not a bad thing for a writer, actually. What does it mean to be a bestselling author when the world is breaking? Arundhati Roy The idea of patriotism has been fused with the idea of Hindu nationalism, so people like myself are on the A-list of \u201canti-nationals.\u201d Of course it helps their cause that I am not Hindu. My mother who raised me is Christian. My estranged father who I never really knew came from a Hindu family and converted to Christianity as did his father and his father\u2019s father. But this doesn\u2019t enrage them as much as the things I write and say. Particularly about Kashmir. A Bollywood actor and BJP member of parliament suggested that I be tied to an army jeep and used as a human shield by the Indian Army in Kashmir. They really should try that. Sadly, the BJP\u2019s macro-radicalization has resulted in micro-versions of the same thing. It is mirrored by its allies, its doorkeepers, concierges and maintenance staff, as well as its victims. As everybody turns inward, bitter and doctrinaire, as every form of solidarity crumbles, as the garbage mountains grow and the rivers shrink, as stock characters locked into their own little ideological bubbles shout at each other on TV, I feel my own skin tightening around me, containing me, too. I struggle against that every day. The only home one has is in literature and poetry. That sentence that makes you gasp \u2013 or smile out loud. The song that breaks your heart. CNN: What kind of India would you like to see \u2013 and how do we get there? Roy: My dreams are not, and never have been, limited by the shape of the map of India, or any country. They\u2019ve always been either much smaller or much bigger. The dream worth dreaming is to see our world moving toward a shared understanding of justice, however slowly, instead of racing away from it at the pace we are.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David A. Andelman, a contributor to CNN, twice winner of the Deadline Club Award, is a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor, author of \u201cA Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen\u201d and blogs at Andelman Unleashed. He formerly was a correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Europe and Asia. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Suddenly, with a single stroke, from one of Europe\u2019s most powerful, unassailable leaders, Emmanuel Macron has become as constrained as President Joe Biden. The French have chosen their National Assembly \u2013 the equivalent of the US House of Representatives \u2013 for the next five years. And the outcome? No party, but particularly not Macron\u2019s, has come out with an absolute majority. While Macron\u2019s centrist alliance, Ensemble!, won the largest number of seats in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections \u2013 with 245 out of 577 seats \u2013 it still falls short of the 289 needed for an absolute majority. Now, having lost the majority he enjoyed in his first term, the French President will be forced to negotiate for every vote, every initiative with those who want nothing more than to see him fail. The far left and far right have control over the no-longer-majority center. And the big electoral surge \u2013 an unprecedented tsunami really \u2013 is from where? The far right. If this all sounds depressingly familiar in Washington, it is. Of course, Biden\u2019s party controls both houses of Congress, but he doesn\u2019t have enough votes in the Senate for the supermajority needed to pass most legislation. And it represents a dramatic reversal from the same moment five years ago when Macron\u2019s candidates for the National Assembly had followed up his dramatic win in the presidential election with an equally dramatic win for an unassailable majority in the parliamentary elections. Macron loses absolute majority after historic gains for French far right and left Now, two critical international meetings are coming up for Macron this month \u2013 a European Union summit to decide on Ukraine\u2019s admission to candidate membership status in the bloc and a NATO meeting in Madrid that will debate, if not decide, on the admission of Sweden and Finland and more resources for Ukraine. All these issues require a consensus that Macron seemed uniquely positioned to hammer out. No longer. His unchallenged ability to set foreign policy under the French Constitution has been eroded by a perception abroad that he is in no longer the uniquely potent leader he had positioned himself in his first term. Gone are the grand ambitions of succeeding retired German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the position as the effective leader of the EU. What Macron wanted more than anything else from Sunday\u2019s balloting for the members of the new national parliament was \u201cune majorit\u00e9 solide\u201d \u2013 a solid majority. The French gave him anything but that. Why Macron's win is a big blow to Putin Of course, they didn\u2019t give that to any of his opponents. All they have now is the ability to make life miserable for him and deliver him defeat after defeat. Again, this is a trans-Atlantic carbon copy of Biden\u2019s situation, the systems perhaps appearing different but the challenges now no less acute. Most dedicated to the mission of making Macron miserable is the NUPES, or New Ecological and Social People\u2019s Union \u2013 the oddball left-wing coalition cobbled together by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. His is now the largest opposition bloc in the National Assembly. With the opposition this time not in a majority, it\u2019s not even a true \u201ccohabitation,\u201d which has existed at least three times in the past in France when one party holds the presidency, another controls the parliament and little has been accomplished. What France seems to have now is simply a route to chaos and enforced compromise. Or as France\u2019s leading all-news channel BFMTV asked on the screen, minutes after the polls closed: \u201cFrance Ungovernable?\u201d Ungovernable remains to be seen, but the results have certainly left in limbo \u2013 twisting in the wind \u2013 Macron\u2019s aspirations for a dramatic transformation of France\u2019s social, economic, political and diplomatic landscape, not to mention its standing in Europe and the world. What does this mean exactly? Well, now Macron has to negotiate for every vote. The far left and far right have control over the no-longer-majority center that for five years, with some scattered exceptions when the French actually went into the streets to protest, allowed the French leader to ram through every reform, the smallest measure that he wanted. The grand ideas Macron had going in for remaking France over the next five years \u2013 just like Biden\u2019s grand ideas in January 2021 \u2013 now risk being ground into the dust of negotiating one by one for a vote here, a vote there. But perhaps the biggest \u2013 and the most ominous \u2013 development is the surge from the far right. The party of Marine Le Pen, whom Macron steamrolled for the presidency twice, has grabbed more than 11 times as many seats as it accumulated in the last election \u2013 from eight in the outgoing parliament to 89 today. Surely former President Donald Trump will take some considerable comfort from the success of a party whose leader plays to the same deep feelings of nationalism. Le Pen comfortably claimed her own seat in the National Assembly, easily winning in a Pas-de-Calais district on the English Channel \u2013 63% to 37%. Suddenly, the grand idea of de Gaulle when he formed the Fifth Republic 1958 \u2013 where the president has more power than parliament \u2013 is all but dead. Now with one stroke, the real power in France is no longer the imperial presidency but a fragmented and cacophonous parliament. France is beginning to look not a little like Italy and its shaky minority governments rather than Germany under Merkel, to whom all 27 nations in the EU could look for inspiration. When will the West lose its appetite for a war with no end? But really, how hard will it be for Macron? A lot depends on just how adroit he is \u2013 how carefully he crafts key measures. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s NUPES is little more than a hastily assembled coalition of disparate left-wing groups \u2013 from ecologists to communists to socialists who still remember what it was like actually to rule France. For decades, many of these parties barely stopped sniping at each other. Now, though, beyond the priority of bringing down Macron, each has some pet projects \u2013 from ecology to tax reform. Macron must prove himself more adept than Biden has been in navigating the US Senate, where virtually every Republican is committed to making him fail on nearly every important measure \u2013 or compromise it into some neutered shadow of what he really wanted going in. The youngest French leader since Napoleon, Macron had hoped to drag France, kicking and screaming if necessary, into the 21st century of modest taxes, a rational pension system, dramatic moves toward a sustainable future and a leadership role in Europe. \u201cFrance is going to be very difficult to govern\u201d was the \u201ccry of alarm\u201d from J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, director of the French polling agency IFOP, adding that Macron \u201chas left a boulevard (open) to his adversaries.\u201d Already, Monday morning the NUPES announced it plans to introduce a no-confidence motion on July 5, though it\u2019s unlikely pass. Still, as any politician knows \u2013 you have to play the hand you\u2019re dealt. And it\u2019s been quite clear for some time, remaining intensely clear even today, that Macron has not finished with a \u201chyperpresidency.\u201d This means at least as much abroad as at home. In the past week, Macron visited French troops in Romania and accompanied German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi to Kyiv for a pace-setting meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of a critically needed vote this week to admit Ukraine to candidate status for EU membership.  In the end, Macron also still has what in French political terms is the nuclear option. He has the right to dissolve parliament and call for new elections. It has happened five times since 1958. The problem is that it could leave France well along the way toward a meta-stable Italian system of revolving door governments \u2013 where seven governments have ruled Italy in the past decade, 10 in this century. Certainly that is the last goal to which either Europe or America should aspire. But neither should we hope for a France, hollowed out, struggling with its identity and its place in the world. It needs, more than ever, not a little help from its friends \u2013 some of whom, like Biden, must understand precisely what Macron faces ahead.",

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. This weekend\u2019s episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d marked not only the season finale, but also the end for a few cast members of the iconic comedy show, including Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant and Pete Davidson. Davidson\u2019s goodbye stole the show, because he did more than be funny. He perfectly called out the right\u2019s hypocrisy as well. Davidson, who joined \u201cSNL\u201d in 2014 at age 20, delivered his farewell on the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update.\u201d He began by joking when he first arrived at the show, \u201cI was just a skinny kid that no one knew which race I was. And now everyone knows I\u2019m White because I became hugely successful while barely showing up to work.\u201d He added, \u201cLook at me now, I\u2019m aging like an old banana.\u201d From there, Davidson delivered a series of punchlines exposing the right for its glaring double standards. The 28-year-old comedian remarked, \u201cA lot has changed. In three years, Fox News went from calling me a monster for making fun of Congressman Dan Crenshaw\u2019s eye patch to also making fun of Dan Crenshaw\u2019s eye patch.\u201d Davidson added, \u201cTucker Carlson called him \u2018eye patch McCain.\u2019 That\u2019s two veterans in one insult.\u201d Davidson could not be more right. And it wasn\u2019t just that a Fox News host was mocking Crenshaw\u2019s war injury but that the same people on the right who attacked Davidson over his earlier joke about the lawmaker were now silent when Carlson did arguably worse. His remark wasn\u2019t on a comedy show but on an (alleged) news network. What a Nobel laureate's take on Donald Trump reveals about today As a reminder, in the lead-up to the 2018 election, Davidson sparked a backlash on the right when he joked on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d about Crenshaw, then a GOP congressional candidate \u2013 who lost an eye from a war injury while serving in Afghanistan. Davidson \u2013 with an image of Crenshaw on the screen \u2013 said, \u201cYou may be surprised to hear he\u2019s a congressional candidate for Texas and not a hit man in a porno movie.\u201d Davidson then added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know he lost his eye in war \u2013 or whatever.\u201d That was too much for many on the right, including Carlson, who slammed Davidson\u2019s joke on his show in a segment featuring an on-screen graphic which read, \u201cSNL Sinks To New Low By Insulting Wounded Veteran.\u201d Carlson then tried to claim Davidson somehow represented the Democratic Party, saying: \u201cWell, for the past two years, the Democratic Party has outsourced much of its political philosophy to the late-night TV shows.\u201d Carlson concluded the message from \u201cSNL\u201d and the Democratic Party was \u201cRepublicans are disgusting,\u201d even if wounded in war. Others on the right also screamed with outrage at Davidson\u2019s joke at the time, including the National Republican Congressional Committee, which demanded, \u201cNBC should immediately apologize to Dan, and to the millions of veterans and military families who tune in every weekend.\u201d Fox News host Greg Gutfeld condemned \u201cSNL\u201d and Davidson on Twitter for causing people to \u201claugh at a vet.\u201d Eric Trump, the son of the then-sitting President, went even further, tweeting \u201cSNL\u201d \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves for last night\u2019s show\u201d and calling Davidson a gutless coward. Dan Crenshaw and Pete Davidson's sincere plea for unity After the uproar, Crenshaw appeared on \u201cSNL,\u201d and Davidson apologized, saying, \u201cThe man is a war hero, and he deserves all the respect in the world.\u201d Crenshaw responded he hoped from this incident that \u201cAmericans can forgive one another.\u201d Last week Carlson, who has a history of pushing pro-Putin propaganda, slammed Crenshaw for his continued vocal support of US help for Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion, calling the congressman \u201ceye patch McCain.\u201d Carlson was strategically linking Crenshaw to the late GOP Sen. John McCain, a frequent target of former President Donald Trump\u2019s, even after his death. But there was no need for Carlson to mock Crenshaw\u2019s war injury. So where is the fury over Carlson\u2019s dig by those on the right who went ballistic over Davidson\u2019s 2018 joke? When I look through the Twitter feeds of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Gutfeld and others who slammed Davidson back then, I can\u2019t find a peep of criticism of Carlson. This double standard sends an obvious message many on the right will only criticize people when they see a political upside to doing so. Going after a comedian such as Davidson who is part of the so-called liberal Hollywood elite is a political winner for them. Taking on the top-rated cable news host such as Carlson, part of the right\u2019s media ecosystem, is not.  Political self-interest also explains why we don\u2019t hear GOP leaders denounce Carlson for his repeated peddling of the \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d allegedly cited by the gunman accused of killing 10 people recently in Buffalo, New York. (Carlson now says he doesn\u2019t know what the conspiracy theory is.) These Republicans don\u2019t see a political upside to denouncing Carlson\u2019s views. However, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, denounced the House GOP leadership last week for enabling white nationalism, white supremacy and antisemitism. Davidson is leaving \u201cSNL,\u201d and he will be missed. But it\u2019s abundantly clear the right\u2019s hypocrisy isn\u2019t going anywhere. In fact, we can expect to see it for many more seasons to come.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN\u2019s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the senior editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.\u201d The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. The January 6 insurrection was both a peak of contemporary American White nationalism and a dress rehearsal for what will likely come next. Simply put, the attack on the US Capitol was the culmination of political trends in the United States that have festered for decades \u2013 and a warning from history about how the politics of the next several years may unfold. What the January 6 report means for the future of democracy The most significant US political development during the past few years has been the rise of homegrown American extremism. This movement has many facets, from the growth of White nationalism to the embrace of QAnon conspiracy theories by a significant number of Americans. In a Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May, 15% of Americans agreed that a Satanic ring of sex traffickers is running the United States government, financial sector and media, while 23% of Republicans endorsed this conspiracy theory. And, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted last month, one in three Americans now endorses the view that violence against the government is sometimes justified. This is all compounded by the overall failure of those running social media platforms to police extremist content in a meaningful way; the deepening polarization of American politics; the profound distrust of government among those radicalized by the pandemic shutdowns and the role of former President Donald Trump as the chief arsonist fanning the flames of discord. Six years ago, when Trump was running for president, I considered the issue of whether he was a fascist. To answer that question, I turned to the classic 2004 study, \u201cThe Anatomy of Fascism,\u201d by American historian Robert Paxton, who forensically examined the fascist movements of 20th century Europe. Paxton found key commonalities among those movements, including the \u201csuperiority of the leader\u2019s instincts over abstract and universal reason\u201d and the \u201cbelief that one\u2019s group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action.\u201d This certainly seemed to describe Trump and Trumpism in 2015, but there was one key trait of fascist leaders that Trump had only begun to embrace back then \u2013 their support of \u201cthe beauty of violence and the efficacy of will, when they are devoted to the group\u2019s success.\u201d The question the GOP must answer about January 6 After Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, he seemed more willing than ever before to call for violent action. Trump called his supporters to Washington, DC for a rally on the specious grounds that the election had been stolen from him \u2013 tweeting, \u201cBe there, will be wild!\u201d Thousands of his supporters gathered on January 6, where Trump further goaded them on by saying, \u201cYou\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\u201d As his supporters went on to attack the key symbol of American democracy, the US Capitol, Trump did nothing to stop them \u2013 despite the pleas of his family members and his reliable cheerleaders at Fox News to call off his followers. After approximately three hours, Trump finally told his supporters to \u201cgo home\u201d in a video in which he continued to lie that the election was \u201cfraudulent.\u201d Months later, Trump described the most spectacular attack on American democracy in decades as a manifestation of \u201cspirit and faith and love.\u201d Back in the reality-based world, the mayhem at the Capitol resulted in over 700 people being arrested, including 75 who were charged with violent crimes. Some 140 police officers were injured in the melee, according to the head of the Capitol Police officer\u2019s union. And five people died as a result of the attack, including one officer. So, it\u2019s mystifying that Trump and his acolytes \u2013 such as Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, who told the crowd, \u201cstart taking down names and kicking ass\u201d \u2013 have yet to be charged with incitement. In the crowd, there were large numbers of Trump followers in military style uniforms \u2013 some of whom were even wearing body armor \u2013 as well as members of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group. As a quick refresher, it is a crime to incite others to commit violent felony crimes if you have reason to believe they may carry out those crimes, according to US Code, Title 18, Section 373. What I witnessed on January 6 For context, this law has been applied in the past against people encouraging jihadist terrorists, such as Virginian Zachary Chesser, who is serving a long sentence, partly because he incited violence against the creators of the show \u201cSouth Park,\u201d after they portrayed the Prophet Mohammed in a critical light. Imagine if all the mayhem at the Capitol had been instigated by Muslim leaders whipping up a mob of thousands of Islamists. Do you have any doubt that those Muslim leaders wouldn\u2019t have already been prosecuted? (Disclosure: As a terrorism expert, I was interviewed by staff members of the bipartisan House committee investigating the January 6 attack, who were interested in discussing how the assault fit into the history of domestic terrorism in the United States.) The Trump-inspired January 6 insurrection and its aftermath has primed the pump for more violence. According to the University of Chicago\u2019s Project on Security and Threats, 9% of adults say they agree the use of force is justified to return Trump to the presidency. Trump has scheduled a rally in Arizona in mid-January, in which he will likely continue to push his false claim that the presidential election was stolen, which will surely further inflame his followers. This discord is only likely to get worse because there are scant countervailing forces on the right pushing back on Trump, and those few Republican politicians who have pushed back are paying significant political costs. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming lost her position in the Republican leadership in the US House of Representatives, while Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois decided not to run for office again. Meanwhile, Trump is likely to run again in the next presidential election cycle \u2013 and his dominance over the Republican Party appears stronger now than it was in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 insurrection. The attack on the Capitol has deep roots in the anti-government, White nationalist movement. The intellectual godfather of that movement is William Luther Pierce, who profoundly influenced an entire generation \u2013 from the White supremacists who carried out the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 to extremists like today\u2019s Proud Boys, who have discussed his writings online. A trained physicist, Pierce was also a key leader of the America neo-Nazi movement in the latter three decades of the 20th century. His most important contribution to White supremacist thought was \u201cThe Turner Diaries.\u201d Pierce published this novel in 1978 using a pseudonym, Andrew Macdonald, and in it he charted the violent overthrow of the federal American government by a group of White \u201cpatriots\u201d who blew up FBI headquarters and attacked the US Capitol. After a race war in which non-Whites are massacred, the novel ends with the establishment of an all-White United States. While certainly a clunky read, \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d has been quite influential, selling hundreds of thousands of copies. A 2016 study by the extremism expert J.M. Berger found that the novel helped to inspire at least 40 terrorist attacks and hate crimes in the United States that resulted in at least 200 murders. The most notorious example of the book\u2019s influence was Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, who was so obsessed with it that he sold copies at gun shows around the United States. McVeigh modeled elements of his 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma federal building, which killed 168 people, on plot points that were in the novel. When McVeigh was arrested, law enforcement officials found quotations from the book in his car. (After the assault on the Capitol, Amazon pulled the book from its website). I produced Pierce\u2019s first network interview in 1996 for CNN. In his compound deep in the woods of Appalachia in West Virginia, Pierce delivered a diatribe against the increasingly diverse United States. The bespectacled Pierce was an owlish presence, holding his cat in his lap as he was served tea by his younger wife who addressed him as \u201cSir.\u201d A pair of male acolytes guarded Pierce\u2019s lair, hanging on his every word. Pierce explained that his novel was designed to be a call to action for White supremacists, telling CNN that perhaps the most important idea expressed in his book is that each person has to be an active participant in what is happening in the world around them. Pierce died in 2002, but his bigoted ideas live on. Like many White supremacists, he was obsessed with the idea that White people were being \u201creplaced\u201d by other ethnic groups and that they had a duty to fight back. Those ideas continue to animate White supremacists and White nationalists, such as those who attended a racist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 \u2013 where they chanted, \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d Fast forward to January 6, 2021. Members of far right groups, such as the Proud Boys, the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers, who all played a role in the assault on the Capitol, framed their attack in similar terms to the plot of \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d \u2013 calling it a planned \u201cinsurrection\u201d against \u201ctyrants\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d who needed to be \u201cexecuted.\u201d Another strand of the White nationalist movement that could be seen in the assault on the US Capitol is \u201cleaderless resistance,\u201d a concept advocated by the prominent American racist Louis Beam in the early 1990s. It was a technique designed to enable his fellow racists to struggle against the American government without fear of being targeted by law enforcement agencies. Beam explained in online writings that the point of leaderless resistance was to keep individuals and groups operating independently, without a central headquarters or single leader \u2013 much like the groups pivotal to the January 6 attack. While there were certainly members of far right groups who played a role in the Capitol assault, hundreds of the assaulters had no connection to any organization, which made them harder to be tracked by law enforcement. They were ordinary Americans seemingly radicalized by what they read and saw on the internet and in right-wing media. The White nationalist roots of January 6 go deep, but its future repercussions are also significant. A CNN poll released in September found that over three quarters of Republicans falsely believe Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election \u2013 and more than 50% of Republicans think there is evidence to support this misleading assertion.  This means that irrespective of the actual results, Trump has likely set himself up well for the presidential election in 2024. He might win the 2024 election outright should he gain the Republican nomination. But should he lose, he has also laid considerable groundwork to make the argument to a sizable portion of the American public that the presidency is once again his. Such claims may produce considerably more violence than what we saw at the Capitol a year ago, especially since millions of Americans now appear to approve of violence as a means to restore the Trump presidency.",

            "article_content": "2022 was not just another year that tried patience and frayed nerves, it was historic and deadly. Russian President Vladimir Putin did what was unimaginable to many, launching the largest land war in Europe since World War II. All too common horrors were unleashed once more on American schoolchildren in Uvalde, Texas, and in many, many other mass shootings in the United States. And, inevitably, luminaries who brought light to our lives were extinguished. When news breaks, the world comes to CNN, as it has for more than 40 years on television and more than 25 years on digital platforms. On average, more than 165 million of you came to CNN Digital from around the globe every month in 2022, according to Comscore. The war in Ukraine dominated the year like no other news, proving, as the pandemic has, that our interests are global and our news coverage needs to be, too. Six of our top 10 stories (and 32 of our top 100) were Ukraine live stories that followed the twists and turns of the day\u2019s news, including the incomparable coverage from CNN\u2019s teams on the ground, often in the line of fire. Early in the conflict, I wrote an analysis explaining the limits of what the US and its allies would and would not do in Ukraine. Those limits have been contentious from the start and are only growing more so today as Russia accuses the West of going too far. The other stories among our top 10 most read, watched or listened to were the tragic school shooting in Uvalde, our election night streaming of CNN\u2019s TV coverage of the midterms and our digital pages of up-to-the-second results from hundreds of races. The overturning of Roe v. Wade and its impact on women\u2019s lives and US politics were a recurring top story, as were the numerous mass shootings and natural disasters. Interest and fear surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic waned as the pandemic itself did, but the last weeks of the year have brought new worries, especially in China. History has taught us that pandemic developments know no borders. Entertainment news brought millions of you to CNN. Our top entertainment story was the tragic death of Stephen \u201ctWitch\u201d Boss, the amiable DJ for \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u201d  There were bright moments too: like the Good Samaritans that made a difference in the lives of strangers. As 2022 draws to a close, we look back over the pictures of the year, the top pop culture stories and the (much-needed) best feel-good stories too! For those playing along at home, every piece on our Top 100 Stories list this year received more than 3 million visits, according to our internal data.

The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack at the US Capitol voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump during Thursday\u2019s public hearing. The committee argued in its final hearing before the midterm elections that Trump was directly involved in the bid to overturn the 2020 election, with the panel presenting new evidence that Trump knew he had lost but had a plan to declare victory no matter the election result. The panel also showed previously unseen footage of congressional leaders taking refuge amid the violence as the panel detailed Trump\u2019s inaction during the attack. The committee is now working to present a final report by the end of the year on whether to make any criminal referrals to the Justice Department.

The jury\u2019s recommendation Thursday came after a monthslong trial to decide the gunman\u2019s punishment. A judge is expected to issue the gunman\u2019s formal sentence on November 1. Victims and family members are expected to speak before the sentence is delivered that day. Five people \u2013 including an off-duty police officer \u2013 were killed and at least two others were wounded in a shooting Thursday in Raleigh, North Carolina, police said. The shooting unfolded around 5 p.m. in the neighborhood of Hedingham and an hourslong ordeal ensued as authorities worked to apprehend the suspect. The suspected shooter, a minor, was taken into custody four and a half hours later, police said. \u201cTonight, terror has reached our doorstep.

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) In an emotional address to the UN Security Council yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of killing civilians for \u201cpleasure\u201d and warned more atrocities could occur. Zelensky\u2019s speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. Separately, the top US military officer told lawmakers yesterday that the world is becoming more unstable and the \u201cpotential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing.\u201d Later today, the US will announce new sanctions on Russia in coordination with several other nations and the European Union, according to an administration official. More than 45 million people are under an enhanced severe weather threat across the Southeast US this morning, where a powerful storm could deliver a triple threat of wind, tornadoes and flooding. Parts of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and the western Carolinas could see damaging winds and a few tornadoes in the coming days, according to the latest forecasts. A flood watch is also in effect for about 2 million people in the region, with some isolated areas getting around 5 inches of rain. The storm system is hitting the region at an unfortunate time, as most areas remain in recovery mode from recent\u00a0 tornadoes and treacherous thunderstorms. At least two people were killed yesterday by the storms, local officials said. The Oklahoma legislature yesterday passed a near-total ban on abortion, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. The bill would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both. The legislation passed the state Republican-led House by a 70-14 vote, without debate or questions on the floor. The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who previously promised to sign every bill limiting abortion that came across his desk. This comes as several state legislatures have advanced bills restricting abortion access. Last week, Arizona\u2019s Republican governor signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months.

            "article_content": "Pedro \u201cPete\u201d Arredondo, the embattled Uvalde school police chief who led the flawed law enforcement response to last week\u2019s school shooting and has remained out of the public eye since, spoke exclusively to CNN on Wednesday and declined to answer substantive questions about the massacre. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), Arredondo has not responded to a request for a follow-up interview with the Texas Rangers, who are investigating the shooting at Robb Elementary. Yet outside his home Wednesday, Arredondo told CNN\u2019s Aaron Cooper, \u201cI am in contact with DPS everyday.\u201d And outside his office minutes later, he told CNN\u2019s Shimon Prokupecz that he\u2019s not going to release any further information while funerals are ongoing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be respectful to the family,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do that eventually. Whenever this is done and the families quit grieving, then we\u2019ll do that obviously.\u201d As Uvalde funerals continue, authorities' timeline of the terror at Robb Elementary continues to shift It\u2019s the first time Arredondo has commented since two brief press statements on the day of the attack, in which he said the gunman was dead but provided little information on the shooting, citing the ongoing investigation. He took no questions at the time and has not appeared in a public forum since. Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the attack last Tuesday, and officials have so far failed to answer major questions about why police took about 80 minutes to breach two locked classroom doors and confront the gunman. The school police chief was identified last week by DPS as the commanding officer who decided not to force their way into the rooms and instead to stand back and wait for reinforcements \u2013 even as children inside repeatedly called 911 and begged police for help. A Customs and Border Protection tactical team ultimately entered the rooms using a janitor\u2019s keys and fatally shot the suspect, DPS said. DPS Director Steven McCraw did not identify Arredondo by name, but he said the chief made the \u201cwrong decision\u201d not to engage with the gunman sooner. He said the commanding officer decided to treat the situation like a barricaded suspect rather than an active shooter. Established law enforcement policy, created in the wake of the Columbine school shooting of 1999, calls for police to stop the gunman as fast as possible in an active shooter situation. Arredondo has worked in law enforcement for nearly 30 years and became chief of police of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (CISD) Police Department in March 2020. In that role, he completed a school-based law enforcement active shooter training course in December 2021, according to his professional training file obtained by CNN. He also completed a school-based law enforcement active shooter training course with the Johnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office in August 2020. Further, he completed an Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training (ALERRT) program Terrorism Response Tactics course in June 2019, according to the document. The ALERRT program is designed to teach officers techniques to save lives after an active shooting, such as how to apply tourniquets, according to the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center. Arredondo was elected to the Uvalde city council earlier this month, and a special city council meeting to swear him and others in had been set to take place Tuesday. However, Mayor Don McLaughlin said in a statement Monday that the meeting \u201cwill not take place as scheduled,\u201d adding \u201cour focus on Tuesday is on our families who lost loved ones.\u201d Uvalde school district police chief sworn in as city council member a week after mass shooting Instead, Arredondo was sworn in privately without advance notice to the media. Although there was no formal ceremony, McLaughlin said that members of the council came to City Hall \u201cat their convenience\u201d during the day to be sworn in, adding that Arredondo appeared in person to receive the oath and sign paperwork. \u201cOut of respect for the families who buried their children today, and who are planning to bury their children in the next few days, no ceremony was held,\u201d McLaughlin said in a written statement. In his Monday statement, the mayor said Arredondo was \u201cduly elected\u201d and that there is \u201cnothing in the City Charter, Election Code, or Texas Constitution that prohibits him from taking the oath of office. To our knowledge, we are currently not aware of any investigation of Mr. Arredondo.\u201d In his short comments Wednesday, Arredondo said the swearing-in was \u201ca private thing\u201d out of respect for the families, saying the families are the focus right now.

The CDC\u2019s mask mandate for travelers is no longer in effect on airplanes and other public transport methods following a federal judge\u2019s ruling yesterday. US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said the mandate was unlawful because it exceeded the authority of the CDC and because its implementation violated administrative law. \u201cThe agencies are reviewing the decision and assessing potential next steps,\u201d a Biden administration official said last night, adding the CDC still recommends that people continue to wear masks in indoor public transportation settings. After the mandate was struck down, several US airlines announced that masks are now optional on their aircraft \u2013 including Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Alaska Airlines and JetBlue.

After the Tesla and SpaceX CEO offered to buy Twitter last week, the company\u2019s board implemented a shareholder rights plan, known as a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d that would make it harder and more expensive for Musk (or any other would-be buyer) to acquire the company without the board\u2019s approval. Now, eyes are back on Musk to see how he might respond to the board\u2019s defensive measure. Musk, who currently owns around 9% of shares in the company, could decide to withdraw his bid, or he could sit tight and exercise the still-significant influence he\u2019d have at the company as one of its largest shareholders. Musk said last week that he has a \u201cPlan B\u201d if his bid falls through, although he declined to elaborate on what it is. The Oklahoma legislature yesterday passed a near-total ban on abortion, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies.

Following the death last month of a 14-year-old boy who fell from an amusement park ride in Orlando, Florida, a forensic engineering firm hired to investigate the incident found the ride\u2019s operator made manual adjustments to two seats. Those adjustments were made \u201cpresumably, to allow for larger riders, which should not have happened based on the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines,\u201d State Rep. Geraldine Thompson said in a news update yesterday. According to the report, the harness on one of the seats was manually loosened to to allow a restraint opening of near 7 inches \u2013 about 4 inches more than the normal opening range for the restraints.\u00a0The FreeFall drop tower manufacturer\u2019s guidelines also put a rider\u2019s weight limit at 250 pounds; Tyre Sampson \u2013 the teen who died \u2013 weighed approximately 340 pounds, his family told CNN. Authorities said they are working to conclude the investigation before assessing what penalties may come. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The right-wing conspiracy outlet Infowars has filed for bankruptcy protection as its founder Alex Jones faces several defamation lawsuits. The move, which could pause civil litigation against the companies, comes after Jones was found legally responsible for damages in three defamation lawsuits related to false claims he made about the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting. In the aftermath of the shooting, in which 26 people were killed, Jones baselessly said the incident was staged. He later swore in a deposition that a \u201cform of psychosis\u201d caused him at the time to believe it was staged. The documents filed on Sunday sought bankruptcy protection for Infowars and Prison Planet, another one of Jones\u2019 right-wing outlets. Jones also sought bankruptcy protection for Infowars Health, a store from which Jones has hawked nutritional supplements and other products.

Macron, France\u2019s current president, is in first place with 28.6% following a preliminary count of the votes from the first round of the election yesterday. Le Pen, a long-time standard-bearer for the French far-right, is on track to come in second with 23.6%. Twelve candidates ran for the top job. Since none of them received more than 50% of the ballots in the first round, the top two candidates will face each other in a runoff on April 24. Macron is seeking to become the first French president to win reelection since Jacques Chirac in 2002, but Le Pen\u2019s support has steadily risen in recent weeks.

More than 45 million people are under an enhanced severe weather threat across the Southeast US this morning, where a powerful storm could deliver a triple threat of wind, tornadoes and flooding. Parts of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and the western Carolinas could see damaging winds and a few tornadoes in the coming days, according to the latest forecasts.

The storm system is hitting the region at an unfortunate time, as most areas remain in recovery mode from recent\u00a0 tornadoes and treacherous thunderstorms. At least two people were killed yesterday by the storms, local officials said. Federal prosecutors are reviewing fake Electoral College certifications that falsely declared former President Donald Trump won several states in the 2020 election that he actually lost, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told CNN yesterday. The fake certificates falsely declaring Trump\u2019s victory\u00a0were sent\u00a0to the National Archives by Trump\u2019s allies in mid-December 2020. They have attracted public scrutiny amid the House\u2019s January 6 investigation into\u00a0the efforts by the Trump campaign to reverse the former president\u2019s electoral defeat.

A major computer chip shortage has left some manufacturers with only five days\u2019 worth of inventory due to supply chain woes. According to a new report from the Commerce Department, the median supply of chips held by manufacturers has dropped from 40 days\u2019 worth in 2019 to less than five days\u2019 worth last year. The limited supply means that disruptions to production overseas \u2014 such as those from weather or new\u00a0Covid-19 outbreaks \u2014 could again lead to factory shutdowns and furloughed workers in the US. This continues to disrupt production overseas while the pandemic and extreme weather cause even more delays. The shortage has been felt across the world, leading to price increases on everything from cars, cell phones, and washing machines. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area.

The Biden administration has authorized more than $2 billion in arms sales to Egypt despite ongoing concerns about Cairo\u2019s human rights record. The State Department said the sale includes military aircraft, air defense radar systems\u00a0 and other related equipment. In September, the US released $170 million in military aid to Egypt but also put $130 million on hold, conditioned on Egypt improving its record on human rights in specific ways. The Egyptian government has been charged with serious human rights abuses, including unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced disappearance, torture, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, arbitrary detention, and restrictions on freedom of speech, expression, and political participation, according to the State Department\u2019s annual report\u00a0on human rights in the country.

In an emotional address to the UN Security Council yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of killing civilians for \u201cpleasure\u201d and warned more atrocities could occur. Zelensky\u2019s speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. Separately, the top US military officer told lawmakers yesterday that the world is becoming more unstable and the \u201cpotential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing.\u201d Later today, the US will announce new sanctions on Russia in coordination with several other nations and the European Union, according to an administration official. The US is amplifying calls for Russia to cease its aggressive actions along the Ukrainian border, where more than 100,000 troops have been amassed. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned yesterday that there would be a severe response by the US and its allies if \u201ca single additional Russian force\u201d enters Ukraine in an aggressive way. In preparation for a possible invasion, the US sent Ukraine a second weapons supply shipment of close to 200,000 pounds of lethal aid. Some political leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, are urging the US and its allies to penalize Moscow with sanctions now before any lives are lost. The US, however, has shown unwillingness to punish Russia preemptively. The Biden administration and its NATO allies are instead focused on bolstering troop levels in the region to support Eastern European and Baltic allies. More than 45 million people are under an enhanced severe weather threat across the Southeast US this morning, where a powerful storm could deliver a triple threat of wind, tornadoes and flooding. Parts of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and the western Carolinas could see damaging winds and a few tornadoes in the coming days, according to the latest forecasts. A flood watch is also in effect for about 2 million people in the region, with some isolated areas getting around 5 inches of rain. The storm system is hitting the region at an unfortunate time, as most areas remain in recovery mode from recent\u00a0 tornadoes and treacherous thunderstorms. At least two people were killed yesterday by the storms, local officials said. The Arizona Democratic Party announced over the weekend that it has formally censured Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema after she voted\u00a0to maintain the Senate\u2019s filibuster\u00a0rules, effectively blocking Democrats\u2019 voting legislation, a key priority for the party. The symbolic gesture from Arizona Democrats adds to the mounting pressure Sinema is facing from those in her state who helped her flip a Senate seat in 2018. Sinema \u2013 who started her political career as a progressive \u2013 has been a target on the left during Biden\u2019s administration for her stances. Sinema and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, both centrists, were the only two Democrats to join all Republicans last week in voting to maintain the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster on legislation. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. The House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol has been having conversations with former Attorney General William Barr. Barr, a staunch defender of former President Donald Trump, pushed the administration\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d message, but resigned in December 2020 after rebuking Trump\u2019s false claims about widespread election fraud. Separately, Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, acknowledged late last week that he was part of the effort to prop up so-called \u201calternate electors\u201d to support Trump in key states. Former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani supervised that effort, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the scheme. It involved helping pro-Trump electors access state Capitol buildings, drafting language for fake electoral certificates to send to the federal government, and finding replacements for electors who refused to go along with the plot. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing increasing pressure this week over alleged garden parties and Christmas gatherings held at Downing Street while the rest of the country was under strict Covid-19 lockdowns. His approval ratings are plunging and the parliamentary rebellion is growing. This is worrying some parts of his ruling Conservative Party that he is becoming a liability. Adding fuel to the fire, Johnson\u2019s former senior adviser Dominic Cummings said he would swear under oath that the Prime Minister was warned about the true nature of one of the parties, but Johnson denied that vehemently. Johnson launched an inquiry into the gatherings and that report is due to come out this week. NFL Playoff upsets Was that not the greatest playoff round\u00a0OF ALL TIME?

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is leaving Democratic leadership after Republicans won the majority. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is remaining at the helm of a chamber Democrats still control. But both said President Joe Biden should run for a second term in 2024 after what they described as an \u201cexcellent\u201d first two years in office. The Democratic congressional leaders\u2019 comments came in their first joint sit-down interview with CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel over lunch at Hunan Dynasty, a Chinese restaurant on Capitol Hill in Washington, where the two have shared meals for years. Pelosi said Biden, who at 80 is already the nation\u2019s oldest president, has \u201cdone an excellent job\u201d in the White House. \u201cI hope that he does seek reelection. He\u2019s a person with great vision for our country. He\u2019s been involved for a long time so he has great knowledge of the issues, and the challenges we face,\u201d she said. Pelosi also said Biden is \u201cthe most empathetic president. He connects with people.\u201d \u201cThe vision, the knowledge, the strategic thinking is all here,\u201d she said, pointing to her head. \u201cThe empathy is from the heart. And I think he\u2019s a great president.\u201d Asked if Biden should run again, Schumer said: \u201cYeah. He\u2019s done an excellent, excellent job. And if he runs, I\u2019m going to support him all the way.\u201d The interview took place less than three weeks before Pelosi steps down as speaker after Republicans won a slim majority in November\u2019s midterm elections. The California Democrat plans to remain in the House, representing her San Francisco district, but is leaving her caucus\u2019s leadership ranks. Schumer and Pelosi reminisced in the interview about past battles with Donald Trump \u2013 and both predicted the former president will lose his third bid for the White House. \u201cThe American people have gotten wise to him. Took a little while, but they did,\u201d Schumer said. The New York Democrat said Americans watched as pro-Trump rioters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and said voters\u2019 understanding of the \u201cdanger to democracy\u201d is partly responsible for Democrats\u2019 stronger-than-expected showing in this year\u2019s midterms. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should talk about him while we\u2019re eating,\u201d Pelosi said of Trump. The comments by the Democratic duo come amid the possibility of a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024. Trump has already announced his 2024 candidacy, though he is likely to face a competitive GOP primary; Biden has not made a formal announcement but has long maintained he will seek reelection, saying he will officially decide early next year. A new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS found little appetite for a rematch between the 2020 rivals. About 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they want their party to nominate someone other than Trump in 2024 (62%), while a similar 59% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they\u2019d like to see someone other than Biden at the top of their ticket in the next presidential election. In the interview, Pelosi and Schumer detailed their actions on January 6, 2021, as Trump-supporting insurrectionists attacked the Capitol. Schumer said he asked acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen to put him on the phone with Trump \u2013 but Rosen would not do so. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t put him on,\u201d Schumer said. Asked if Trump would not take their call, Schumer said, \u201cRight. Correct.\u201d Those calls came three days after a high-stakes Oval Office meeting at which Trump considered replacing Rosen as acting attorney general with loyalist Jeffrey Clark so that Clark could use his powers to attempt to overturn the 2020 election. In that meeting, Trump was told that if he followed through on that plan, top Justice Department officials, including Rosen, would resign. Pelosi contrasted Trump with the Republicans she\u2019d worked with as House Democratic leader, including former speaker John Boehner. She described Trump as insane. \u201cI think there\u2019s a need for an intervention by his family or something. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s on the level now,\u201d Pelosi said. In the interview, the two described a close relationship of more than three decades \u2013 \u201calmost like brother and sister,\u201d Schumer said. That relationship involves regular dinners and talking on the phone four times a day \u2013 too many, Pelosi joked \u2013 all because Schumer has a flip phone. \u201cIf he had a regular smartphone, we could reduce the number of conversations because I could just text him,\u201d she said. The two discussed a heated Oval Office meeting with Trump in December 2018, during which Trump said in front of news cameras that he would shut down the government over lawmakers\u2019 refusal to fund his US-Mexico border wall. \u201cChuck was masterful,\u201d Pelosi said of the meeting, in which Schumer prompted Trump to make the declaration that he would shut the government down. \u201cShe set him up so I could go in for the kill,\u201d Schumer said. Schumer said Pelosi was able to successfully navigate Trump\u2019s presidency because she treated the Republican like a child. \u201cI tell people Nancy instinctively knew how to handle Trump because her first 35-40 years of life she raised five children,\u201d he said. Schumer said despite Pelosi\u2019s departure from House Democratic leadership, the two will continue to speak regularly. \u201cI will be certainly calling,\u201d he said, \u201cand seek her advice and a feeling of what\u2019s going on in the House and what we can get done.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The government funding standoff gripping Washington ahead of Friday\u2019s shutdown deadline is one of the first indicators of the coming shift in power dynamics that will return the capital to a governing cold war between congressional Republicans and a Democratic White House. An omnibus spending bill that would avert the closure of the federal government would be one of the last acts of unified Democratic political control of Washington. But it\u2019s being pushed to the last minute as the routine disputes between Republicans and Democrats over spending priorities are exacerbated by conservative Republicans who want to hold key decisions until the new Congress in January, when they hope to use their new House majority to cut spending. It\u2019s an early glimpse of the paralysis that could result from divided government with neither side having the power to fully deliver on promises they made to voters in last month\u2019s midterm elections, when Republicans won the House and Democrats retained control of the Senate. Biden White House warns against 'disastrous consequences' as Congress barrels toward government funding deadline Some of these clashes, like disputes over funding social programs and the need to raise the government\u2019s borrowing limit next year, threaten to shut the government or badly damage the US economy. This heralds a return of the government shutdown threats that were a regular holiday season tradition during the Obama administration after Republicans gained congressional majorities. And during Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the government shut down for 35 days over the 2018-19 holiday season because of a dispute over the then-president\u2019s demand for border wall funding \u2013 leaving federal workers furloughed and putting critical programs and services on hold. This time, Republicans, especially in the House, believe that they have a mandate from voters to stem domestic spending on issues like Covid-19, climate change and other priorities that have characterized President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. And even though Democrats control the House until the end of the post-election lame duck session, muscle-flexing GOP lawmakers want to use their new power now. Democrats, meanwhile, understand that the government spending bill likely represents their last chance to enact Biden\u2019s ambitious domestic plans until the next presidential election. The fraught final weeks of 2022 may also be their best opening to bypass the incoming GOP House by honoring Biden\u2019s $37 billion request for new aid for Ukraine, which some conservatives oppose and which could be added to the government spending bill. Democratic leaders say the omnibus bill is urgently needed to fund police departments, to ease congestion at ports and to improve medical care for veterans and to help the US compete with China, among scores of other priorities. But Republicans argue domestic non-defense spending has already had a huge boost in Biden\u2019s Covid-19 rescue measures and in his new climate and health care law. Kyrsten Sinema's defection without a difference The chances of a deal in the coming weeks hang in the balance and are creating a conflict between the need for good governance and politics \u2013 one that is usually resolved in bitterly divided Washington in favor of the latter force. The year-end government spending showdown \u2013 a classic example of Congress\u2019 tendency to put off tough decisions until the last possible moment \u2013 is also being complicated by the need to pass the $858 billion National Defense Authorization Act. The House passed a version of the measure last week after ending Covid-19 vaccination mandates in the military in order to draw Republican votes. In a sign of rising political pressure over the spending clash, a group of Republican senators wrote to GOP leader Mitch McConnell last week, laying out their strategy and urging him to block a big spending bill and to agree to a short-term funding package to keep the government open for a few weeks. \u201cFor the Senate to ram through a so-called \u2018omnibus\u2019 bill\u2014which would fund the entirety of the Pelosi-Schumer spending agenda through most of next year\u2014would utterly disempower the new Republican House from enacting our shared priorities,\u201d said the letter signed by six senators including Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida. Their stance helps explain why McConnell last week gave a grim prognosis for a deal with Democrats on a big funding bill, commenting, \u201cWe don\u2019t have agreements to do virtually anything. \u2026 We don\u2019t even have an overall agreement on how much we\u2019re going to spend, and we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d There is one school of thought that the passage of a long-term funding mechanism might actually give House GOP leaders a break since a short-term deal would raise the possibility that one of the first acts of a new majority would be to trigger a government shutdown \u2013 a state of affairs that has often been politically damaging to the reputation of the party saddled with the blame. But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is already under fierce pressure from the most radical members of his conference as he struggles to get enough votes to become speaker. He has little political leeway and has therefore been heaping public pressure on Senate Republicans to thwart Biden\u2019s hopes of one more spending package, saying on Fox News earlier this month that once Republicans have the gavel in the House, \u201cWe would be stronger in every negotiation.\u201d His comments, while offering a glimpse of how he plans to preside over a confrontation with the White House, also offered insight into how the GOP House could make McConnell\u2019s life more complicated next year as he tries to manage his party in the Senate. Democrats are determined to get a government funding bill passed in the final days of their party\u2019s House majority and are also gearing up for the battles that will unfold at the beginning of next year. If lawmakers cannot agree on a deal, they will face the possibility of either passing a short-term spending bill to carry the debate into the new Congress or a longer-term continuing resolution that would extend current spending levels. But a senior Biden administration official warned last week that even a funding deal that lasted a year would have \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences for key programs. Bash to Sanders: Are you worried about a government shutdown on Friday? And on Sunday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, implied that Republicans were trying to jam Democrats at the end of this year to kickstart their effort in the new GOP House to slash spending on vital social programs. \u201cRepublicans see it as an opportunity to hold us hostage and get demands that, under normal circumstances, they would not,\u201d Sanders said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cLook, they have not been shy about making it clear they want to cut Social Security, they want to cut Medicare, they want to cut Medicaid,\u201d Sanders told Dana Bash. Biden sent Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin up to Capitol Hill last week to brief senators on the war in Ukraine. But in a sign of the consuming nature of the spending showdown, Republicans emerged from the meeting complaining that the two secretaries spent time lobbying for an omnibus spending bill over a continuing resolution. \u201cIt was a waste of their time. It was a waste of our time,\u201d Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy told reporters. He said that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had asked Blinken and Austin to explain why the new spending bill was so necessary. \u201cI knew as soon as Chuck said that. \u2026 this is just a political exercise,\u201d Kennedy said. Given the gulf between Democrats and Republicans who would be needed to back a spending deal in the Senate, it is increasingly likely that Congress may have to pass an ultra-short term measure to get past Friday\u2019s deadline to allow for an extension in negotiations that would push lawmakers ever closer to the holidays. \u201cBring your Yuletide carols and all that stuff here because we may be singing to each other,\u201d South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters last week.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is facing a flurry of criticism on Capitol Hill, with Republican fury growing over their failure to take back the Senate and GOP leaders at odds over their strategy with the former president still maintaining a dominant hold on the party. The GOP reckoning comes in the wake of the party leaving another critical Senate seat on the table \u2013 Georgia \u2013 and seeing Democrats expand their majority to 51-49. Hours after Trump\u2019s hand-picked candidate, Herschel Walker, failed to pick up a Democratic seat, the blame game began in earnest \u2013 in large part directed at the former president. Many argued that the party establishment must take a heavier hand in the 2024 election cycle and root out unelectable Republicans even if they\u2019re backed by Trump. Others said the GOP needs to embrace early voting and wholly reject Trump\u2019s demagoguery of mail-in voting, something that helped power Democratic victories. And some top Republicans said the party\u2019s refusal to reject Trump as their standard bearer \u2013 combined with the 2020 election denialism that is central to his platform \u2013 ultimately did them in and will cost them again in future cycles. \u201cIt\u2019s just one more data point in an overwhelming body of data that the Trump obsession is very bad for Republicans, but normal Republicans are doing extremely well,\u201d said retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose open seat was picked up by a Democrat. The Republican soul-searching comes at a critical moment for Trump and the party. Senate GOP leaders are eager to move on from the Trump years and court candidates who have more moderate and mainstream appeal to the suburban voters who left them over their disdain for the former president. But they are up against a powerful and vocal Trump-aligned faction within their party \u2013 especially in the incoming House GOP majority, where a hard-right bloc now holds major sway over GOP leader Kevin McCarthy and his pursuit of the speakership \u2013 as they argue the party needs to return to its bedrock conservative principles. And for Trump, the loss in Georgia is the latest in a growing list of political problems that has caused a new rift within his party and raised major questions about his viability as a 2024 presidential candidate. In the wake of his Mar-a-Lago dinner with prominent antisemites, and subsequent call for the \u201ctermination\u201d of the US Constitution, many on Capitol Hill see the loss in Georgia \u2013 along with shortfalls in Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania \u2013 as the final breaking point between him and his party. Even a staunch ally, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said Trump needs to convince his party that he can turn things around. \u201cI think he\u2019s in a good spot to get the nomination, but he\u2019s got to prove to people he can win,\u201d Graham told CNN. \u201cAnd the more people get in the race, I think probably the better, because you\u2019ll have some points of comparison.\u201d Graham added: \u201cHe\u2019s still very popular in the party. People appreciate his presidency. They appreciate his fighting spirit. But there\u2019s beginning to be a sense, can he win?\u201d Others were far more skeptical. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican, said the GOP tried to focus the 2022 midterms on President Joe Biden and Democratic policies they argued were making inflation worse and intensifying problems at the US-Mexico border. But when Trump stumped for candidates late in the campaign season, as he did for Republican Senate nominees Adam Laxalt in Nevada and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, it gave Democrats fresh ammunition on the trail. \u201cIn an election year where it should have been a referendum on the current administration and their policies, the Dems were in many cases able to turn it into a choice election because of Trump\u2019s presence out there,\u201d Thune told CNN. \u201cSo was he a factor? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that.\u201d Thune took his criticism further. \u201cA lot of the candidates who had problems in these elections were running on the 2020 election being stolen and I don\u2019t think independent voters were having it,\u201d Thune said. Not everyone agreed. \u201cWhen I talked to voters \u2026 what they wanted to know is if their votes are never going to be diluted,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, the Florida Republican and outgoing chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cI think that\u2019s what was really important.\u201d Amid the strategic decisions now under discussion: Whether to engage more forcefully in the 2024 primary season to avoid the problems of 2022. In the next cycle, Republicans have a far more favorable Senate map, with Democrats defending 23 seats and Republicans defending 11 seats. Three of those Democratic seats \u2013 Ohio, Montana and West Virginia \u2013 are in states that Trump won twice. \u201cStill got to talk to my wife but we\u2019ll let you know when we do make the decision,\u201d Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said Wednesday when asked if he\u2019d run to defend the seat he\u2019s held since 2007. But the potential GOP primary in his state could offer a preview of how Republicans will handle intraparty clashes going forward. Some want a heavier hand to eliminate candidates they view as unelectable, a contrast from the 2022 cycle when Scott opted not to engage in primaries through the NRSC. The new incoming chairman, GOP Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, appears to have a different view. \u201cClearly you want to see candidates who can win general elections and we\u2019re going to keep working that in,\u201d Daines said. Some say a new approach is desperately needed. \u201cWe need better candidates,\u201d said Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican who is retiring. And others blame the candidates\u2019 strategies. \u201cI think the fundamental lesson is it takes one kind of campaign to win a primary and it takes another kind of campaign to win a general election,\u201d said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of GOP leadership. \u201cAnd when you try to run a general election like you run in a primary, without appealing to a broader base of the electorate, then you\u2019re going to lose.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that over and over and over again,\u201d he added. But Scott contended they had \u201cgood quality people\u201d who ran this cycle as he defended his decision to stay out of primaries. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019ve got to rely on the voters in the states,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s their states. I trust the voters.\u201d Scott, who clashed with Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell this year over embracing a policy agenda that the Kentucky Republican repudiated, said the GOP needs to focus on another matter: Having a \u201cgood national message.\u201d \u201cI believe we ought to have our Republican agenda and give people a real purpose for how to vote \u2013 why to vote for us.\u201d Despite the disagreement over Trump, Republican senators up-and-down the line agreed that the party needs to put a renewed focus on mail-in voting, something that Trump demonized over the past few years. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to get out the early vote with our voters,\u201d said Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican of Iowa. But that could require confronting Trump, something GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah said is well overdue. \u201cI think President Trump has had a very substantial impact on who\u2019s going to win a primary and it hasn\u2019t worked out well,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll recognize that his endorsement can be the kiss of death.\u201d CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox, Ali Zaslav and Morgan Rimmer contributed.",

            "article_content": "By bombing the power grid meant to sustain Ukrainians through dark, cold months, Vladimir Putin is inflicting some of the most barbaric wartime conditions experienced by civilians in Europe for decades. The use of winter as a weapon of war is designed to break the will of a nation that has humbled Russian forces \u2013 and to test the generosity of Western publics footing the bill for Ukraine\u2019s defense. And it is forcing President Joe Biden and other leaders to make another round of adjustments to the lifeline of armaments and aid sustaining Ukraine\u2019s resistance. The intensity of Moscow\u2019s deliberate targeting of civilians has also revived questions over if and when the world should press for a diplomatic end to the war as well as a rising domestic political debate about how long multi-billion dollar aid must last. This pressure, notably inside the incoming Republican House majority, often spikes alongside Putin\u2019s calculated spurts of nuclear brinkmanship and whenever fears rise that the war will spill into NATO territory. First on CNN: US considers dramatically expanding training of Ukrainian forces, US officials say These questions will be at the center of talks Thursday between Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, the two most critical leaders of the West, who will be essential to any eventual ceasefire and who have at times differed on whether diplomacy can work with a leader as ruthless as Putin. If anything, Biden\u2019s determination to help Ukraine win the war on the battlefield is only growing even as Macron, who has been more open to the possibility of diplomatic efforts, keeps open a channel with the Russian leader. As it has throughout the war, the administration is constantly recalibrating its aid based on new conditions. CNN\u2019s Oren Liebermann, Katie Bo Lillis, Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood first reported Wednesday that Biden is considering a dramatic expansion in the training the US military provides to Ukrainian forces, including instructing up to 2,500 soldiers a month in Germany. The drills would cover more sophisticated battlefield tactics including on how to coordinate military maneuvers with artillery support. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN Wednesday that NATO is seeking to invest in Soviet-era weapons and ammunition for Ukraine\u2019s forces. And he told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that Washington was also focused on providing air defense systems. CNN reported Tuesday the US was considering sending Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine \u2013 in what would be yet another threshold crossed by the White House. Germany has pledged more anti-aircraft tanks. Several nations are sending in generators after Russian missile and drone attacks took out electricity facilities. Vast stocks of fuel will also be needed. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday that he detected new urgency from Western donors but that they needed to supply everything his country needed as quickly as it is needed. \u201cThese decisions have been taken after some kind of tragedy took place on the frontline, which left no other choice but for this decision to be taken.\u201d In recent days, expressing resolve ahead of Macron\u2019s visit, US officials have been using graphic language to describe the depravity of Putin\u2019s tactics, which hark back to World War II bombardments of civilians and are creating the worst human suffering in a European conflict since the 1990s in Bosnia. \u201cHeat, water, electricity, for children, for the elderly, for the sick \u2014 these are President Putin\u2019s new targets. He\u2019s hitting them hard,\u201d Blinken said at a press conference at the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Bucharest. \u201cThis brutalization of Ukraine\u2019s people is barbaric.\u201d John Kirby, the National Security Council\u2019s coordinator for strategic communications, said Putin\u2019s record meant there was no surprise about the new twist in his war. \u201cThis is a guy who\u2019s used food as a weapon.  He\u2019s used fear as a weapon. Now \u2026 he\u2019s using the coming cold weather here to basically try to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees,\u201d Kirby said on Monday. \u201cWhen you take a look at what he\u2019s hitting, it\u2019s almost all civilian infrastructure. \u2026  It\u2019s energy, it\u2019s water, it\u2019s the kind of resources that people need as they get ready to brace for what will no doubt be a cold winter.\u201d The suffering of the Ukrainian people in the months to come and the ever larger sums needed to support them \u2013 Biden just asked Congress for another $37 billion \u2013 are likely to increase political debate in the US and allied nations about whether it\u2019s time to look for a way out of the war. At least that is what Putin is clearly banking on \u2013 and its why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska, who addressed British lawmakers Tuesday, keep up a constant public relations offensive. Still, reflecting a more difficult political climate for Ukraine in Washington, the possible next Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy warned again after meeting Biden on Tuesday that there would be no \u201cblank check\u201d for Ukraine. The California Republican is under fierce pressure from pro-Donald Trump lawmakers, who will have significant leverage in his small House majority, to divert funds intended for Ukraine to increase security on the US southern border. At midterm election campaign events, the former president also complained about US generosity to a country that he dragged into his first impeachment. And one of his top followers, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has called on the US to force Ukraine to negotiate a peace with Putin. But Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, warned on Wednesday that Putin was betting on just such a weakening of Western resolve. \u201cIf we don\u2019t sustain, that would not be in the interest of America or the world,\u201d he said. Speculation about how the war might end is not just being sparked by the sense that it will be harder next year for Biden to sustain the current level of US funding. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley caused a stir when he appeared to argue earlier this month that Russia and Ukraine would have to recognize victory was impossible as the front locked down for winter. \u201cWhen there\u2019s an opportunity to negotiate, when peace can be achieved, seize it,\u201d Milley said. A week after those comments, which reverberated from the US across the Atlantic, Milley suggested that there was a possibility of a political solution \u2013 involving a Russian withdrawal \u2013 because Ukraine was in a position of strength. Still, a full withdrawal appears still to be the kind of humiliation that Putin may not be able to bear politically, so the incentive for him to grind on \u2013 no matter how many Russians and Ukrainians die \u2013 is still alive. Washington has consistently said that there can be no negotiations over the heads of Ukrainians, and given their battlefield success, including the recent expulsion of Russian forces from the southern city of Kherson, Kyiv\u2019s willingness to talk, as Western-provided military material flows across the border, may be limited. Kirby suggested on Monday that the way the war would end would be with a Ukrainian victory. He pledged Washington would \u201cgive Ukraine the tools and capabilities they need to succeed on the battlefield so this war can end \u2026 in a way in which Ukraine can be whole and sovereign and free.\u201d While the new House may be shaky on Ukraine next year, the Biden administration still appears to have strong support on the issue among Senate Republicans. Risch said that while he\u2019d do some things differently, \u201cThey are committed deeply, they\u2019re working closely with our allies and they\u2019ve got contingency plans for things that might go awry.\u201d This new phase of the Ukrainian war means that remarks by Biden and Macron at the White House will be watched intensely around the world. There is a major incentive for both to create a strong impression of unity. The French president has become Washington\u2019s most important European point of contact. He\u2019s the key leader in the European Union, especially after German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s retirement and the political paroxysms and exit from the EU that have made Britain a less prominent global player. But France and the US have not always been on the same page. While Paris is closely allied with Washington, it has long pursued an independent foreign policy that can sometimes irk US officials. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine and even during the war, Macron has kept in touch with Putin. He has warned that the Russian leader should not be humiliated since he\u2019d be less likely to talk peace. Some former high-ranking Western officials, like ex-NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen have claimed that Macron\u2019s efforts at diplomacy have only weakened Western unity on the conflict. But speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in September, the French president vowed to continue speaking to Putin and warned that the longer the conflict drags on, the more it would threaten European and world peace. But he also appeared to stiffen his tone toward Russia, accusing it of seeking to return the world to an age of imperialism. \u201cNegotiations will only be possible if, sovereignly, Ukraine wants it and Russia agrees to it in good faith. We all know as well that negotiations will only be successful if Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty is respected, its territory liberated, and its security protected,\u201d Macron said. Given that even the French president\u2019s conditions for talks are still out of sight, there is little prospect for peace negotiations soon. That means the grinding winter of hellish suffering for Ukrainian citizens will go on. And the need for US and allied aid will only get more acute, even as a political debate stirs about how much more the American people can afford.",

            "article_content": "Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker, facing renewed and growing questions about his residency in the final week of the runoff campaign, described himself during a campaign speech in January as living in Texas and said he decided to run for Georgia\u2019s Senate seat while at his Texas \u201chome,\u201d according to a CNN KFile review of his campaign speeches. Georgia Democrats have called for an investigation by state officials into Walker\u2019s residency after CNN\u2019s KFile reported last week that Walker was getting a tax break in Texas intended for a primary residence, possibly running afoul of Texas tax law and some rules for establishing Georgia residency for voting and running for office. \u201cI live in Texas,\u201d Walker said in January of this year, when speaking to University of Georgia College Republicans. Walker was criticizing Democrats for not visiting the border when he made the comments. \u201cI went down to the border off and on sometimes,\u201d he said. Earlier in the speech, Walker said he decided to run for Georgia\u2019s Senate seat while at his Texas home after seeing the country divided. \u201cEveryone asks me, why did I decide to run for a Senate seat? Because to be honest with you, this is never something I ever, ever, ever thought in my life I\u2019d ever do,\u201d said Walker. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the honest truth. As I was sitting in my home in Texas, I was sitting in my home in Texas, and I was seeing what was going on in this country. I was seeing what was going on in this country with how they were trying to divide people.\u201d The Georgia Republican is heading into a runoff election against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock on December 6. Walker and his campaign have so far not commented to CNN or others on the reporting of the tax break or questions about his residency. On Monday, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reported that Georgia authorities have been urged in a complaint to investigate Walker\u2019s residency. Georgia Democrats in a statement called for an immediate investigation of Walker\u2019s residency, and Congresswoman Nikema Williams, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia, also asked authorities to see if Walker lied about living in Georgia. \u201cThe Georgia Bureau of Investigations and the Georgia Attorney General\u2019s office must immediately investigate whether Herschel Walker lied about being a Georgia resident,\u201d Williams said. A CNN KFile review of some of Walker\u2019s media appearances and events from 2021 and 2022 finds Walker appeared on Fox News and other conservative media from his Texas home at least four times after announcing his candidacy for Georgia\u2019s Senate seat. The interviews at his Texas home took place twice in September 2021 and in February and March of 2022. Before announcing, all of Walker\u2019s media appearances on Fox News and on other conservative media, around 20 in total, took place in Texas.",

            "article_content": "The American tradition of peaceful transfers of presidential power buckled in the horrific violence of January 6, 2021. Twenty-two months on, a Washington, DC, jury shored up the breaches in the country\u2019s democracy on Tuesday, with a monumental verdict against right-wing insurrectionists. But while the courts \u2013 and voters in the midterm elections \u2013 have reaffirmed the rule of law, a furor over ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with a White supremacist Holocaust denier is underlining just how fragile it remains. As does the refusal of Republican leader Kevin McCarthy \u2013 the man who would like to be House speaker \u2013 to forthrightly condemn Trump on Tuesday for breaking bread with an extremist. In a landmark jury verdict, Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes and a subordinate, Kelly Meggs, were found guilty of seditious conspiracy and other charges in what the Justice Department said was a plot to keep Trump in power after his 2020 defeat. Oath Keepers leader and associates convicted of multiple charges in seditious conspiracy case The convictions for a rarely prosecuted offense delivered justice over a constitutional outrage, laid down a deterrent to future coup instigators and showed the legal system can enforce accountability for assaults on democracy. And they reinforced the narrative that the US Capitol insurrection was not simply a too exuberant protest that spilled over but a pre-planned bid to overthrow the government, the Constitution and the will of voters. The verdicts came as Special Counsel Jack Smith presses ahead with investigations into the ex-president, including over January 6. On that front, Trump\u2019s former close aide Stephen Miller testified to the grand jury on the matter, CNN reported. Yet a momentous day for democracy represented by the Oath Keepers convictions also brought fresh signs that the forces of authoritarianism, extremism and election denialism are far from vanquished. McCarthy, who is running to be speaker of the very same House ransacked by Trump\u2019s supporters last year, shielded the ex-president from criticism over his dinner with White nationalist Nick Fuentes a week ago. The California Republican did say Fuentes had no place in the GOP. But his false claim that Trump had condemned the far-right firebrand four times was consistent with his willingness to appease the ex-president\u2019s incitement in order to bolster power for himself and his party. McCarthy likely needs the support of Trump, and his hard-right supporters in the House, to become speaker next year and if he gets the job, he will remain in their debt. Fuentes is a Holocaust denier who also has links with pro-Trump House Republicans like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who spoke at a White nationalist conference he organized. Extreme lawmakers like her will be even more influential in a narrower House GOP majority. And bringing the events of the day full circle, Fuentes was on the Capitol grounds on January 6, after weeks spouting falsehoods about the election at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies. Tuesday\u2019s dramas also unfolded amid fresh signs that although voters rejected many election deniers in the midterm elections, the virus of election denialism is yet to be stamped out. A county in Arizona and one in Pennsylvania have refused to certify their results from this month as misinformation swirls and far-right activists seek to sow distrust in the system based on fraudulent claims. Despite the US political system holding firm after the 2020 election and being reinforced by the 2022 midterms, when many pro-Trump election deniers lost in swing states, the most fateful divide in American politics remains not between left and right, but between the forces of democracy and those of authoritarianism. Almost every day in Washington can be viewed as a tug between those opposing dynamics, which sometimes cross partisan lines and are boiling to the surface again as the twice-impeached Trump seeks to recapture the presidency. After seven weeks of testimony, Rhodes and Meggs were both convicted of seditious conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding. Three other defendants were found guilty of a range of other charges related to the insurrection in a vindication of the DOJ\u2019s response to the attack on democracy. What it means that a special counsel is running the Trump investigations The seditious conspiracy charge is an accusation that an offender conspired to overthrow, put down or destroy by force the government of the US. Specifically, the jury\u2019s verdict is a boost for the notion that the Justice Department can prosecute and obtain convictions on such complex charges and a rebuke of Trump world\u2019s dismissal of the riot at the Capitol. The fact that the jury acquitted some of the defendants of the most serious charges also insulates the prosecution against any claims that it was a partisan trial before a politicized jury. Stepping back, this court case \u2013 one of many ahead targeting alleged perpetrators of the insurrection \u2013 represents a tangible attempt to repair American democracy following the trauma of the 2020 election. \u201c(This) is a great day for the United States, for the rule of law, for the peaceful transfer of power and making sure that that is protected because that was essentially what was on trial,\u201d said Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security, intelligence and terrorism analyst. \u201cThe opposite would have been very bad, I think, not just for the Department of Justice but for incitement and violence \u2013 people would have thought that they could have gotten away with it.\u201d Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who sits on the House select committee investigating the insurrection \u2013 which is expected to unveil its final report next month \u2013 said the verdicts would solidify the sense of what really happened in the traumatic weeks after the 2020 election. \u201cThe character of January 6 is now finally sinking in to the whole country,\u201d Raskin told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar. \u201cThis was a series of events that was designed to overthrow a presidential election and essentially topple the constitutional order.\u201d The end of the Oath Keepers trial, combined with other convictions of January 6 rioters, reinforced a lingering question: Will there also be accountability higher up the chain \u2013 ultimately for those around Trump and the former president himself? He concocted the lie of a stolen election, which has ravaged faith in US democracy, and then told his supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to save their country at the Capitol. First on CNN: Top Trump adviser Stephen Miller testifies to January 6 federal grand jury Any convictions in a related case can increase the sense of legal exposure for those also involved in a wider drama. But it remains unclear whether there is sufficient evidence or chances of a conviction to threaten Trump, at least in a legal forum. But in a sign of the seriousness of Trump\u2019s position, Miller testified to the grand jury Tuesday, making him the first known witness to do so since the appointment of Smith, CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz reported. Miller would be in a position to understand Trump\u2019s state of mind before rioters invaded the Capitol. As well as Trump\u2019s role leading up to the insurrection, the special counsel is investigating the ex-president\u2019s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Trump has not been charged in either investigation. But both raise the extraordinary possibility that an ex-president \u2013 one who is again an active White House candidate \u2013 could be indicted. That\u2019s a scenario that would provide the justice system with an even greater test than it faced in the Capitol insurrection, especially since Trump is claiming as a central plank of his campaign that he\u2019s the victim of a partisan persecution. Much of McCarthy\u2019s appearance at the West Wing on Tuesday \u2013 after talks on the current lame duck session of the Democratic-controlled Congress with President Joe Biden and other congressional leaders \u2013 was squarely within the confines of conventional politics. Fact check: Kevin McCarthy falsely claims Trump condemned White nationalist Nick Fuentes He swaggered, consistent with the Republican capture of the House earlier this month, albeit with a smaller-than-expected majority. He was combative, showing his rank-and-file members he was ready to take the White House to task and wield Republican power, setting the tone for a new divided Washington next year. And by stressing core Republican issues like the southern border and backing Twitter chief Elon Musk, he appeared to be shoring up his speakership campaign with soundbites likely to reverberate on conservative TV stations. McCarthy genuinely has a mandate to hold Biden to account \u2013 assuming he finally gets the 218 votes he needs to win the speaker\u2019s gavel in January. Still, his somewhat melodramatic tone might also have been designed to impress Trump if he was watching on television. McCarthy has made a choice to give license to extremism in his conference and on the part of the former president if it paves his path to power. In his first on-camera response to Trump\u2019s dinner with Fuentes \u2013 who was also joined by rapper Kanye West, who has changed his name to Ye \u2013 McCarthy said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should be spending any time with Nick Fuentes. He has no place in this Republican Party.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s comments were a clear repudiation of the Holocaust denier. But he wasn\u2019t finished \u2013 and went on to blur the lines about Trump\u2019s behavior and spread misinformation about exactly what the ex-president had said and done. Analysis: GOP reaction to Trump's embrace of Holocaust denier reveals who still won't cross him \u201cI think President Trump came out four times and condemned him, and didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d McCarthy said. The Republican leader\u2019s statement was at best inaccurate, if not deliberately misleading. Trump has made at least four statements about his meeting with Fuentes, but mostly to claim that he didn\u2019t know anything about him or his views before he showed up at Mar-a-Lago. Given that Fuentes was a vocal supporter of the ex-president, that\u2019s a tough statement to believe. \u201cI had no idea what his views were, and they weren\u2019t expressed at the table in our very quick dinner, or it wouldn\u2019t have been accepted,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox Digital on Tuesday. But again, he didn\u2019t condemn Fuentes or his views, sending familiar veiled signals to far-right groups in his electoral base. On the one hand, McCarthy\u2019s dancing on the head of a pin was a troubling sign in someone who could soon be the third-highest ranked official in the country. But his defense of Trump and the controversy it will stir up in the media could rebound to his political benefit, since there\u2019s nothing hardline Republicans like more than seeing their leader waging a fight with establishment Washington. And his unwillingness to unequivocally condemn the former president for meeting the Holocaust denier shows that the strain of extremism that Trump stirs to cement his political power remains a powerful force in the GOP.",

            "article_content": "With one week to go before Georgia\u2019s Senate runoff, heavy hitters and big dollars from both national parties are pouring into the state for a race that will determine the balance of power in the Democratic-controlled Senate next year. But the most sought-after stamp of approval belongs to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was comfortably reelected to a second term this month after defying a Donald Trump-backed primary challenge earlier in the year. Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker has Kemp\u2019s endorsement and, in the final stretch, television commercials and a live, side-by-side appearance to show for it. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, though, has been busy telling Georgia voters that they don\u2019t have to choose between him and Kemp. The incumbent, who\u2019s running for a full six-year term, has run ads and hosted an event starring \u201ccrossover voters\u201d \u2013 or people who cast a ballot for the governor and who have said they plan to do the same for Warnock on December 6. Analysis: Is Donald Trump going to sink Herschel Walker? \u201cWarnock\u2019s got a lot of resources. He can do whatever he wants, but at the end of the day, I don\u2019t think any of that stuff matters,\u201d Kemp said in a \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d interview with Kaitlan Collins that aired Tuesday. \u201cIt matters what people think and what they\u2019re dealing with in their everyday lives. And I know people are dealing with 40-year high inflation. I know that they know that the border is a disaster, and you got Joe Biden saying after the November election he\u2019s not going to change a thing.\u201d The candidates\u2019 appeals to Kemp supporters not only underscores the governor\u2019s popularity in Georgia, but the power of moderate swing voters expected to decide whether Warnock wins a full term or Walker unseats him. Republicans swept the races for statewide seats in Georgia earlier this month. Walker, meanwhile, was outpaced by Kemp in total votes by more than 200,000 \u2013 which either signals he has room to grow his share or that he\u2019s already been written off by otherwise Republican-leaning voters. Kemp is trying to help Walker claw back or draw out voters who either rejected the nominee on Election Day or passed over the Senate race. After previously lending his turnout apparatus to national Republicans, he has now cut two ads for Walker, including a fresh one this week. The 30-second spot includes video of Kemp on the trail with Walker and the governor saying, \u201cIt is time to retire Raphael Warnock and send Herschel Walker to the United States Senate.\u201d Kemp also appears in a mailer from a pro-Walker super PAC that tells voters, \u201cYou stopped Stacey (Abrams). Now reject Warnock.\u201d Kemp defeated Abrams in a rematch of their 2018 contest by nearly 300,000 votes. If the Republican prevails, the parties will again split the Senate 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris providing a tie-breaking vote and Democrats the slightest possible advantage. Analysis: These are the end-of-year political showdowns that will help decide America's future Democrats will control the chamber after the party\u2019s incumbents held their ground and Pennsylvania\u2019s John Fetterman picked up a seat held by retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. But this is still a race full of consequences. In the short term, a Warnock victory would deliver more power to Democrats as they seek a firmer grip on the procedural life of the Senate, which could help them confirm more Biden nominees in a more expeditious manner. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin would also lose some of his leverage, if Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had a vote to spare, which could hold added significance given Manchin is facing reelection in 2024. Senate Minority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, spelled out the stakes on Monday. \u201cHaving an evenly divided Senate means that you get equal representation on committees,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been successfully able to bottle up some bad nominees at the committee level. So (the Georgia race has) got real consequences.\u201d Thune also conceded that his party could use a morale boost after underperforming expectations in the midterms, despite narrowly gaining control of the House. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to get a win on the books, and especially in a state like Georgia, where, frankly, we think we should be winning,\u201d Thune said. Beyond that, looking ahead to the next election in 2024, Republicans \u2013 already with a more favorable map than this year \u2013 would be better positioned to win back a majority, perhaps a significant one, if Walker can pad their numbers now. Top party officials, donors and voters hardly need convincing. Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker getting tax break in 2022 on Texas home intended for primary residence More than 150,000 people cast ballots over the weekend, including more than 70,000 on Saturday following a failed Republican court challenge arguing the polls should be closed because it followed a holiday. Late on Monday, Georgia\u2019s second-ranking election official, Gabriel Sterling, tweeted that the state had broken a single-day record, with more than 300,000 people early voting on Monday. Overall, more than 500,000 votes have already been cast ahead of next week\u2019s Georgia runoff election, according to data from the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office. About 470,000 of those votes have been cast during in-person early voting. While some counties held early voting last week or over the weekend, every county is required to hold early voting Monday through Friday of this week. The condensed time frame leading up to the runoff means there are fewer days of early voting than there were before the general election. Even as the votes come in, both candidates are still ramping up to Election Day. For Warnock, that means another visit from former President Barack Obama, who will be in Atlanta on Thursday. The senator was joined on the stump by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker over the weekend and welcomed musician Dave Matthews to a Monday night rally. On Tuesday, Walker will welcome Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel and Oklahoma Sen.-elect Markwayne Mullin. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham have also been out in force for Walker, who finally shared a stage with Kemp 10 days ago. The stakes are such that even the parties\u2019 most powerful figures are making tough decisions in order to help their side gain any advantage \u2013 or, in the cases of President Joe Biden and former President Trump \u2013 be careful to do no harm. Both Trump and Biden have steered clear of Georgia, where neither is popular with those decisive swing voters, during the campaign. Trump, who recruited Walker to run and has been a consistent supporter, will not appear in the state ahead of the December 6 election, a person close to Walker confirmed to CNN. Many Republicans also blame Trump\u2019s false claims about the 2020 election in Georgia for their defeat in the January 2021 runoffs, when then-GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler lost to Democrats Jon Ossoff and Warnock, respectively. Democrats and Republicans invest millions to turn out beleaguered Georgia voters ahead of key Senate runoff Trump is also now under fire for dining last week with prominent White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. Asked about that meeting by CNN\u2019s Collins, Kemp \u2013 who had already broken with Trump over the 2020 election \u2013 initially pointed to a previous denunciation before again questioning Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cThat was a bad decision. There\u2019s no place for that in the Republican Party,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cAnd (Trump\u2019s) got, you know, his answer to that question, and I\u2019ll let him speak to that. But my views on that are very clear.\u201d Some Republican operatives in Georgia were hopeful that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential presidential candidate who, like Kemp, was just reelected, would make an appearance for Walker, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be in the cards, the source said. One potential reason why: Other GOP operatives in Georgia told CNN they had raised the point that a DeSantis visit might effectively provoke Trump into holding a rally over the concerns of Republicans in Georgia and around the country. Biden, too, is steering clear, though there has been less agitation around his decision. Republicans have spent much of the race hammering Warnock over his record of consistently voting for the president\u2019s legislative agenda. Warnock, in turn, has sought to highlight his bipartisan work in the Senate and has steadfastly kept his distance from any potentially divisive figures in his party. His party, though, hasn\u2019t been shy in spending on Warnock\u2019s behalf. Though the official Democratic Senate campaign arm has only spent about $40,000 on television and digital ads ahead of the runoff, Democrats on the whole \u2013 led by Georgia Honor, which is funded by the Democratic Senate Majority PAC \u2013 has already invested $14.4 million. (The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced a $7 million investment in field operations once the runoff was confirmed earlier this month.) It\u2019s a roughly similar story on the Republican side, where the National Republican Senatorial Committee has spent just over $500,000, considerably less than the GOP\u2019s Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely tied to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, which has so far shelled out about $11.5 million. That figure could rise in the coming days if SLF stretches to reach its previously announced plans to spend more than $14 million on the race. And as money continues to pour into Georgia, a pair of ads launched this week reflect the increasingly negative tone of runoff, with each campaign seizing on personal attacks to make the case to voters in the final week. Walker\u2019s campaign aired a new TV spot Tuesday morning that features clips from a police interview with Warnock\u2019s ex-wife, who accused him of running over her foot with his car in March 2020, though no charges were filed. \u201cFind out who Reverend Warnock really is,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. Meanwhile, Warnock\u2019s campaign launched a new TV ad on Monday that features several people reacting to clips of Walker on the campaign trail, delivering off-topic, meandering remarks on vampires versus werewolves, and complaining about \u201cbad air\u201d from China. \u201cIt is embarrassing,\u201d one viewer says. \u201cLet\u2019s call it what it is. It is embarrassing.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to provide more details on what the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has spent on ads and field operations for the runoff. CNN\u2019s Ethan Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Mike Pence on Monday condemned Donald Trump for having dinner with White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and rapper Kanye West, who has voiced a number of antisemitic views of late. But in so doing, he also sought to rewrite some history. \u201cPresident Trump was wrong to give a white nationalist, an antisemite and a Holocaust denier, a seat at the table and I think he should apologize for it,\u201d Pence said in an interview with NewsNation. So far, so good. But then Pence went on. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Donald Trump is an antisemite. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s a racist or a bigot,\u201d said Pence. \u201cI would not have been his vice president if he was.\u201d Which, well, that is honestly pretty debatable. Consider: * After White nationalists provoked a violent clash in 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people, on both sides.\u201d * Trump decried immigrants coming to the US from \u201cshithole countries\u201d during a meeting with lawmakers in 2018. * Trump has repeatedly referred to Covid-19 as the \u201ckung flu\u201d and the \u201cChina virus.\u201d * Trump propagated the lie that Barack Obama was not actually born in the United States and therefore was ineligible to be president. Trump has also falsely suggested that Kamala Harris was not eligible to be vice president. * In his presidential campaign announcement speech in 2015, Trump insisted that Mexico was sending \u201crapists\u201d who were \u201cbringing crime\u201d and \u201cbringing drugs\u201d into the US. * Trump said that a federal judge of Mexican descent couldn\u2019t be impartial about a case because of his supposed animosity about Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall on the southern border. (The judge was born in Indiana.) * Trump referred to Elizabeth Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d amid a controversy about her claims of Native American heritage. * Trump initially refused to condemn former KKK official David Duke, who endorsed his presidential campaign. (Trump later said he didn\u2019t hear the question properly and that he had disavowed Duke \u201cthe day before [he was asked] at a major conference.\u201d) * Trump tweeted that four minority members of the Democratic House caucus should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they were from. Three of the four were born in the United States. * Trump once described an attempt to impeach him as a \u201clynching.\u201d * Asked about the Proud Boys, a White nationalist group, during a 2020 general election debate, Trump told the group to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d There\u2019s more \u2013 a lot more \u2013 but you get the gist. For years, Trump has trafficked in racial stereotypes, both in and out of office. Most of the comments above happened while Trump was in the White House and Pence was serving as vice president. It\u2019s impossible to look at that record and not conclude \u2013 at the very least \u2013 that Trump was more than willing to engage in bigoted language and racist tropes for what he perceived to be his own personal political benefit. Pence\u2019s comments on Monday are an attempt to paper over his own role in aiding and abetting Trump\u2019s behavior in the White House. The simple fact is that Pence was a loyal second in command, regularly defending Trump from his various self-created controversies. Pence\u2019s desire for revisionist history is understandable. Following his refusal to go along with Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, Pence has fallen out with Trump. Trump is now running for president a third time, while Pence is taking steps toward a bid of his own. But the record reflected above is clear: Trump\u2019s decision to meet with a White nationalist is not the exception but the rule during his time in public life. And that very much includes the years that Pence was at his side.",

            "article_content": "America is heading for a year-end political collision that will set the stage for showdowns between the new Republican-led House and the Democrats who still wield power in the Senate and White House. A fraught coda to the political battles of 2022 will decide who holds the government purse strings and how far the US will go in funding Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. It will showcase extremism in the incoming GOP-run House and the size of the Democratic Senate majority. And the 2024 presidential campaign is grinding into gear with ex-President Donald Trump stirring controversy on multiple fronts and President Joe Biden pondering a reelection bid. In Congress, a lame-duck session will see standoffs that could risk a government shutdown and over the must-lift US government borrowing limit, with grave implications for the economy. Meanwhile, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is scrambling to solidify support in his bid to become speaker in January, with a smaller-than-expected incoming majority giving his extreme pro-Trump colleagues extra power. And the House January 6 committee is poised to soon unveil its final report on Trump\u2019s negligence and incitement leading up to the US Capitol insurrection. The findings, amid signs of acrimony inside the panel, could further color sentiment towards the ex-president as he seeks to build momentum after an underwhelming 2024 campaign launch \u2013 and as powerful donors, as well as prominent Republicans considering their own White House ambitions, are openly castigating Trump for hosting and then failing to disavow White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. The special counsel probe into his hoarding of classified documents and 2020 election chicanery is also gathering pace. Trump is also one of the factors playing into the Georgia Senate runoff election on December 6 that could give Democrats slender breathing room in the chamber or extend the 50-50 split broken only by Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tie-breaking vote that made Biden\u2019s agenda so precarious for the last two years. These next few weeks will show the country has failed to fully process the trauma of the Trump presidency or to arrive at the sense of normality that Biden promised during the 2020 campaign \u2013 even as the two rivals maneuver ahead of a possible rematch in 2024. They will also stress the near impossibility of governing at a time when America is deeply split between two political poles since big questions are likely to get pushed down the road. Big issues not solved this December will be pitched into an even more volatile atmosphere by an aggressive GOP-controlled House primed to slam the White House with partisan investigations. There\u2019s also the renewed threat of a freight rail strike that could again clog supply lines and fresh Democratic calls for more action on gun control after a tragic new spate of mass shootings. The Democrats have a massive agenda before relinquishing the House but have little political room or time to accomplish it. Still, Congress is expected to mark one milestone in the coming weeks. The Senate is expected to vote to codify rights to same-sex and interracial marriage after a procedural vote on the measure earlier in November demonstrated strong bipartisan support. Here is what to look out for in the coming weeks. Congress must pass a bill to fund the government by December 16 or risk a partial government shutdown. The administration has asked for $37.7 billion in aid for Ukraine, $10 billion for extended efforts to combat Covid-19 and an unspecified amount for disaster relief after hurricanes hit Florida and Puerto Rico. Democrats will remain in control of the House until the new Congress in 2023, but a major spending package will also still likely require agreement from 10 Republicans to beat a Senate filibuster. GOP senators are especially skeptical about the administration\u2019s warnings that the US will suffer a relapse in its exit from the pandemic without billions more dollars in funding. And even getting a Democratic majority in the chamber to sign on could be a challenge since West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin could make another stand against another spurt of government spending, especially since he would face a tough race if he decides to run for reelection in 2024. There is likely sufficient support for new aid to Ukraine in the Senate, but funding President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s war for democracy against Russia is set to become far less routine next year as pro-Trump House members, like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, are vowing to halt aid needed for vital weapons and ammunition. They want the cash sent to reinforce the southern US border instead. The most serious showdown of the new Congress could come over raising the government\u2019s borrowing limit that is due to be reached sometime next year. Failure to do so could trash faith in America\u2019s willingness to pay its bills and send shockwaves through the US and global economy. McCarthy has already warned he will require spending concessions on key programs in return for allowing the government to borrow more money \u2013 a scenario that triggered several damaging fiscal showdowns during the Obama administration. To avoid a repeat, Democrats could use the waning days of their control of both chambers to raise the debt ceiling themselves, using a budgetary process known as reconciliation that could bypass a Senate filibuster. But the process is hugely complex, in terms of congressional choreography and time. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said before Thanksgiving that the \u201cbest way to get it done, the way it\u2019s been done the last two or three times is bipartisan.\u201d But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell didn\u2019t express much interest in Schumer\u2019s invitation sit down to sort out the issue, saying \u201cI don\u2019t think the debt limit issue is until sometime next year.\u201d The House Republican leader has a big problem \u2013 finding the votes in the new GOP majority to fulfill his dream of becoming speaker. McCarthy staked out a series of hardline positions heading into the holiday in an apparent effort to appease pro-Trump lawmakers after several declared they won\u2019t vote for him. The California lawmaker can afford to lose only a few GOP votes if he wants to be speaker. During a trip to the border last week, he warned Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to resign or face possible impeachment next year. And he said he\u2019ll follow through on a threat to throw high-profile Democrats, such as Reps. Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell and Ilhan Omar, off of top committees next year. Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, Schiff accused McCarthy of adopting extremist positions for his own naked political gain. \u201cKevin McCarthy has no ideology, has no core set of beliefs,\u201d Schiff told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, saying the top House Republican will do \u201cwhatever he needs to do to get the votes of the QAnon caucus within his conference.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s struggle to confirm his speakership lies partly in the smaller-than-expected GOP majority following the lack of an expected \u201cred wave\u201d in this month\u2019s election. And it could be a preview of a volatile majority and the extent to which his tenure, if he does win the speakership, will be hostage to the whims of the far-right Freedom Caucus and pro-Trump lawyers who want to use their majority as a weapon against Biden. But McCarthy also has to worry that two years of relentless, partisan investigations could turn off voters and lead them to snatch away the party\u2019s fragile edge in the House in the 2024 election. But before the 2024 election gets into full swing, there\u2019s unfinished business from 2022. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker go head-to-head in a runoff on December 6 after neither broke the 50 percent threshold the first time around. Former President Barack Obama, who was the most effective Democratic messenger in the midterms, is due to campaign for Warnock on Thursday. Walker\u2019s chances could depend on whether he is able to win over a significant block of Republican voters who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for him despite backing Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Walker\u2019s problem is that he\u2019s a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Trump, from whom Kemp kept a good distance. After Trump announced his 2024 campaign days after the midterms, Warnock and his supporters started framing the runoff as the first chance for Democrats to stop Trump\u2019s bid to return to the White House. Their argument recalled complaints by many Republicans that Trump\u2019s intervention in two 2020 Senate runoffs in Georgia cost the GOP the chance to control the Senate. This might all be about one seat. But holding the Senate 51-49 rather than 50-50 would be huge for Democrats because it would insulate them from the incapacitation of one of their members and could diminish the power of Manchin, who has been a stubborn brake on Biden\u2019s aspirations for two years. The former president finds himself under unusual political pressure inside the Republican Party he has dominated since 2015. His backing of several losing, election-denying and unpolished candidates in the midterms angered many key figures in the party. His hosting of Fuentes at the same time as rapper Kanye West at his Mar-a-Lago estate worried Republicans who fear that while he may be a formidable candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, Trump\u2019s empathy for the far-right will again doom him before a national electorate. Another potential Republican presidential candidate, outgoing Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, condemned the incident as \u201cvery troubling\u201d on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for a leader that\u2019s setting an example for the country or the party to meet with (an) avowed racist or anti-Semite,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cYou want to diminish their strength, not empower them. Stay away from it.\u201d Trump acknowledged the meeting in a Truth Social post, but claimed he knew nothing about Fuentes. He also did not disavow him or his views. This latest storm comes as the new special counsel Jack Smith, blasted by Trump as a \u201cpolitical hitman,\u201d gets up to speed on the serious legal challenges facing the ex-president, who\u2019s suffered several recent defeats in court in his bid to delay accountability. Trump\u2019s early declaration of a campaign \u2013 apparently to quell the buzz around possible alternative Republican candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2013 leaves the former president needing a way to create some traction in December and in the early months of the year when he might find it hardest to win political exposure. The opening stages of the campaign will begin to answer the central question of Trump\u2019s 2024 run \u2013 whether his so far rock solid appeal to the GOP base will counter concerns in the wider party about his broader viability. Trump\u2019s decision to jump in the race has also increased scrutiny of whether Biden, who turned 80 earlier this month, will decide to run for reelection. The president was asked by CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein during his holiday vacation in Nantucket how his conversations about 2024 were going with his family. \u201cWe\u2019re not having any. We\u2019re celebrating,\u201d Biden replied.",

            "article_content": "Top Democrats see Republicans\u2019 unenthusiastic greeting of Donald Trump\u2019s third White House bid with a combination of schadenfreude and perhaps some other German word for terrifying, unintended consequences: They love seeing the former president struggle, but privately some tell CNN they worry this could lead to a more difficult 2024 campaign against a younger, fresher Republican. President Joe Biden heads into Thanksgiving for the first of several stretches with family members whose advice he\u2019ll seek on whether to launch another campaign. He has privately and publicly signaled that he sees Democrats\u2019 better-than-expected midterm results as an endorsement of him running for a second term \u2013 and he\u2019s reveling in how many in his party seem to be agreeing with him. Biden and his aides believe that even with a potential recession looming next year, his reelection argument will grow stronger. They say voters will start to feel the benefits from the implementation of laws the president has signed over the past two years. They think House Republicans flexing their narrow hold on power through government shutdowns and debt ceiling showdowns to try to force repeals of those same laws will help them even more. How Joe Biden and the Democratic Party defied midterm history According to CNN\u2019s conversations with 24 Democratic elected officials, top operatives and Biden aides, the past two weeks have left them more confident that Biden would be their best bet to beat Trump in 2024. Some say they miscalculated how much appeal Biden continues to hold. Others now realize voters see him as a likable enough bulwark against extremism and a decent man, who can be a standard-setting, consensus choice amid historic polarization. Several onetime opponents say they\u2019ve come around to thinking that maybe his approach in not responding with rage to the people raging at him has been more effective with voters. \u201cWhat he did translated more with voters than favorability ratings, and that\u2019s important for Democrats to remember as we go forward,\u201d said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, adding that after talking to Biden on the election night call he received as chair of the Democratic Governors Association, he\u2019d be \u201csurprised\u201d if the president doesn\u2019t run again. When asked, though, how they\u2019d feel about Biden\u2019s chances against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or other Republicans who could make a generational argument without the baggage Trump brings, many Democrats\u2019 voices tend to tighten. \u201cNot great,\u201d said one top operative. \u201cUneasy,\u201d said two others, in separate conversations. Others point out that nearly all of Democrats\u2019 key midterm victories were narrowly won, leaving them worried about how little room for error there likely will be next time. Four Democratic members of Congress, asking not to be named to speak candidly, estimated that at least half of their colleagues would pick someone other than Biden as their 2024 nominee \u2013 if they could vote by secret ballot. All four also said that if there were a second question about whom they\u2019d want instead, the votes would be all over the place \u2013 with several noting that one of the strongest arguments for Biden running is that it would help Democrats avoid a chaotic primary and give their bench time to gain more experience before the 2028 election. Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, the first Democrat in Congress to call for Biden not to run, said that regardless of his respect for the president, the midterm results or where Biden\u2019s popularity lands, the party needs to \u201ccreate pathways for new generations of leaders.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a pragmatic element of this too. I believe the country will be in a place where they\u2019ll be looking for a new generation as well,\u201d said Phillips, whom several colleagues note has become the person voicing feelings others are keeping private. Joe Biden celebrates his 80th birthday Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, one of the few Democrats running in 2022 who appeared at an event with the president and scored an unexpectedly big reelection win in the onetime swing state, had long talked about how the best argument for another Biden campaign was that he could beat Trump again. Asked after Trump\u2019s announcement if he\u2019d be as confident in Biden against another Republican, Bennet dodged. \u201cI just think that\u2019s too contingent a question to answer,\u201d the senator said. A few weeks ago, when many expected significant House losses for the party, Phillips was one of multiple Democrats predicting that the election aftermath would include more and louder calls for Biden to step aside. Phillips acknowledged last week that those calls haven\u2019t come but attributed that more to the \u201cculture of deference\u201d in Congress than to renewed support for Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like when Trump was president, and none of the Republicans would say what they really thought on the record,\u201d said one Democratic strategist. Democratic Rep. Ann McLane Kuster also expressed doubts about Biden running for reelection as she campaigned in New Hampshire. Back in Washington after winning a sixth term by a wider-than-anticipated margin, she said she\u2019s still not convinced. \u201cI\u2019m still in a wait-and-see, and I think a lot of people are,\u201d Kuster said, noting that she has \u201cbeen a Biden fan since she I was pregnant with my son, who was just sworn into the New York Bar.\u201d Asked how she\u2019d feel about Biden going up against a Republican who was younger and fresher than Trump, Kuster initially responded with a long \u201cHmmmmm.\u201d She said she\u2019s less concerned about that because she believes if Biden does run, that will drive Republicans to Trump, while if Biden doesn\u2019t, that will drive them away from Trump. \u201cIt is an easy thing for people to underestimate Joe Biden \u2013 and they\u2019ve been doing it and being wrong for a couple of election cycles now,\u201d said one Biden adviser. As for those who still have doubts, \u201cthere are some Democrats who aren\u2019t happy unless they can be anxious about something,\u201d the adviser added. Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections Incoming members of Congress who won their seats this year are among the most openly enthusiastic about a Biden reelection campaign. \u201cI think he\u2019s the guy who can beat anybody,\u201d said California Rep.-elect Robert Garcia, who\u2019s close with both the West Wing and Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cPresidents get reelected if they\u2019re successful and if the American people want them back, and to me there is nothing in the president\u2019s first two years that points to that he shouldn\u2019t run again.\u201d Maxwell Frost, the 25-year-old Florida Democrat who is the first member of Generation Z (those born after 1996) elected to Congress, said he was supporting Biden too, minutes after borrowing a tie to make his first visit to the House floor to watch 82-year-old House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announce she\u2019d be stepping down from leadership. \u201cHe\u2019s been unafraid to put forth bold, transformational ideas and policies, and that\u2019s really what excites young voters,\u201d Frost said, citing the infrastructure deal and the health care, tax and climate package dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act. Asked whether he was concerned about a potential generational contrast with Biden if the Republicans back someone other than Trump, Frost said, \u201cI\u2019d say good luck with whoever they put up.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\u201d who the Republican nominee is, argued Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, fresh off his own reelection in a swing state that Biden won narrowly in 2020. \u201cThe Biden-Harris administration will carry Nevada and will carry the country again.\u201d After a strategy of not even saying Trump\u2019s name at all in his first year and then pounding on Trump by name throughout the midterm campaigning, the president is expected to revert to talking about his predecessor \u201csparingly,\u201d an adviser said. What Biden and aides will do, though \u2013 like with the new section of the White House website touting administration achievements, which was launched last week a few hours before Trump\u2019s presidential announcement \u2013 is emphasize their record in contrast with Trump\u2019s rhetoric. A Trump rematch might be easier, several Democratic operatives involved with the preliminary thinking said, because they\u2019d know how to go about it. They hope that one lesson of the midterms is Democrats\u2019 ability to make voters see many leading Republicans as extreme and tainted by Trump. As they wait on a Biden decision that they expect to drag into at least January, and with members of the president\u2019s own Cabinet divided on whether he\u2019ll go through with a launch, aides are planning to head into next year with events and travel to showcase now-tangible achievements. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a bridge built that wasn\u2019t built this year, more of the impact of prescription drug benefits will be felt,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an early and consistent Biden supporter. Early planning is also underway for a string of state dinners, starting with one scheduled for December 1 to honor French President Emmanuel Macron, both to highlight what the White House says is Biden\u2019s reasserting of American global leadership and to demonstrate another notch toward a post-pandemic normal. Inside the White House's months of prep-work for a GOP investigative onslaught Meanwhile, aides are also gearing up for two years of trying to frame every move by the new House Republican majority as extremist overreach, including undermining the legitimacy of any investigations in the eyes of the media and the public. They\u2019re counting on House Republicans who face tough reelections in 2024 to themselves back away from some of the biggest threats, such as impeaching the president. And as personally painful as any Republican inquiries of Biden\u2019s son Hunter will be for the president, aides believe that the politics will boomerang in their favor by making Republicans look like they\u2019re chasing conspiracy theories down rabbit holes rather than governing and by making Biden seem empathetic in a way that has consistently been his greatest strength. \u201cThe last two Democratic presidents lost the House \u2013 by far more than Biden did \u2013 and in both cases, that provided a powerful reelection foil,\u201d said a person familiar with White House thinking. \u201cWe are dealing with a much more extreme Republican Party than they were. \u2026 But Biden does not provoke the Republican base in the way that other national Democrats have.\u201d Republican attempts to make Biden an anchor to Democratic midterm candidates by saying his name and flashing his image in ads about inflation, border control or gas prices don\u2019t seem to have been decisive for independents and swing voters. Biden\u2019s greatest weakness has repeatedly proved his greatest strength, several Democratic strategists said: People don\u2019t feel strongly about him. There are few T-shirts with his face on them or flags with his name on them, but he also doesn\u2019t inspire passionate hate. As Republican operatives tend to admit, voters\u2019 sense of him is so well established that it\u2019s hard to make anything stick to him. What does stick, in focus group after focus group: his age \u2013 he turned 80 on Sunday \u2013 and the sense that he\u2019s not up to the job. One place where that caused problems: Pennsylvania, where Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was seen as independent from Biden \u2013 until the aftermath of his stroke. Then, focus groups noted, voters began to draw connections between the two men related to their physical fitness for office. (Fetterman, however, was able to overcome enough of those perceptions to help his party flip an open seat.) Biden \u201chas his work cut out for him in terms of having folks believe he can command this job for four more years,\u201d said one person familiar with the focus group findings. As Trump blusters, DeSantis builds his case but tells people to 'chill out' with 2024 talk Some Democratic politicians and operatives shudder imagining a younger Republican nominee campaigning around the country at multiple stops a day, bounding onstage and reinforcing the skepticism that\u2019s already in voters\u2019 minds. These Democrats say their solace is fantasizing about Trump failing to snag the GOP nomination and then sabotaging the Republican nominee\u2019s campaign, out of spite. Biden\u2019s inner circle has seen the focus group data and has heard the same complaints. They\u2019ve also seen how those concerns faded over the summer, as Biden signed more bills. That mattered for other Democrats too, with Rep. Dan Kildee, who just won a tight reelection race in Michigan, saying that people connecting with those legislative successes \u201cgot me over the finish line.\u201d Kildee said he believed Biden would be strong against Trump in Michigan, which Trump won by less than half a point in 2016 but Biden carried by 3 points in 2020. As for how he\u2019d fare against another Republican, \u201cthere\u2019s too many chess moves between now and then to figure that out yet,\u201d Kildee said. After how unpredictable the factors shaping the 2020 and 2022 elections were, Biden\u2019s circle doesn\u2019t see a point in trying to guess exactly what he\u2019d be campaigning on by the end of 2024. But the Biden adviser touted the president\u2019s \u201cwisdom and experience,\u201d saying that had \u201callowed him to achieve an extraordinary legislative record and extraordinary record of global leadership in the first two years of his term.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see anybody else that\u2019s stronger. With all the things he\u2019s doing, I don\u2019t care how old he is,\u201d said Eileen Reyes, a former Pete Buttigieg supporter from Luzerne, Pennsylvania, speaking ahead of Biden\u2019s joint rally with Barack Obama in Philadelphia the Saturday night before the election. Stephanie Schlatter, a lawyer in Washington who wore her old Biden-Harris white T-shirt to the celebratory speech Biden delivered at a Washington theater two days after the midterms, agreed. \u201cMy parents are older than he is, and they\u2019re still whooping it up,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are starting to come back from the nastiness, and they\u2019re starting to see results.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A storm of investigations targeting leaders of both political parties will shape the 2024 campaign, but risks angering voters who just showed their frustration with their priorities being ignored. Republicans wasted no time after finally crawling last week to the 218 seats needed to win the House to promise relentless investigations of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, policies and family. The thin nature of their majority, which takes over in January, is already offering their most extreme members significant leverage over leadership. What it means that a special counsel is running the Trump investigations In a momentous move, meanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland last week named a special counsel to take over investigations into Donald Trump\u2019s hoarding of classified documents and his behavior leading up to the US Capitol insurrection. The decision underscores the gravity of the probes and their threat to Trump but also the extraordinary reality that an ex-president and already declared presidential candidate faces the possibility of indictment during a White House race. The political reverberations of the investigations into the current and former president will be immense. They could bear on both Trump\u2019s and Biden\u2019s prospects in the 2024 election, should the president run for reelection, and are certain to deepen the political polarization afflicting America. And they will pose a challenge to both parties since one lesson of the midterm elections was that voters were not happy with the Democrats\u2019 delivery on the economy but didn\u2019t trust radical election-denying Republicans to do better. The aftermath of the 2022 campaign \u2013 a competitive presidential race and split control of Congress featuring tiny majorities \u2013 now offers either side a chance to grab all the levers of Washington power in 2024 by shaping a fresh message that this time really addresses voters\u2019 needs. But it is not yet clear how the flurry of investigations will help either Democrats or Republicans satisfy their voters\u2019 most fundamental concerns. House Republicans vow to investigate Biden and his family's business dealings Trump, who has not been charged with a crime, is facing formal criminal probes from the Justice Department that will now be overseen by the special counsel. And the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, although it has no power to charge Trump, has built up a damning picture of his conduct and is expected to release a final report by the end of the year. Next year, Republicans investigating Biden will be under pressure to demonstrate they are conducting genuine oversight and not simply partisan show hearings for political reasons. After failing to capture the Senate, Republicans will lack the authority to enact a conservative agenda, so the most obvious way for them to wield power will be in a barrage of House investigations targeting the administration, which they clearly hope will weaken Biden in the run-up to the 2024 election and help the eventual GOP nominee. \u201cWe finally have a check and balance,\u201d Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who is seeking to become the new speaker in January, said at the Republican Jewish Coalition gathering in Las Vegas on Saturday. Here are 5 big investigations House Republicans are planning to launch Already, the incoming GOP majority is promising probes of the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, China, the conduct of government health officials during Covid-19, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, the situation at the southern border, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, Garland and Education Department officials. Also in their sights is the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and claims his business dealings caused ethical clashes for the president himself. A long string of televised hearings, document subpoenas and demands for testimony is expected, for which the White House, as CNN reported last week, has been preparing for months. McCarthy, who needs the support of hardline pro-Trump lawmakers to become speaker next year, confirmed in his Republican Jewish Coalition speech and on Fox Sunday that he will block a trio of Democrats \u2013 California Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar from the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees, respectively. The move is seen as revenge for when the Democratic-led House stripped Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee posts over her apparent condoning of violent social media posts against Democrats before she was elected. Greene spent part of the weekend retweeting Trump\u2019s historic tweets making false claims of election fraud and misinformation after the ex-president\u2019s Twitter account was restored by the platform\u2019s new owner Elon Musk. Greene is already one of the most visible members of the incoming GOP majority, having launched a bid to end US aid to Ukraine. She also demanded the impeachment of Garland following his appointment of a special counsel. Investigation and oversight is an essential function of Congress, so McCarthy\u2019s majority will be well within its rights to unleash the machinery of accountability. At the same time, however, many of the lines of investigation appear highly politicized and some seem to arise out of accusations and conspiracies carried on conservative media more than they spring out of good governance. Republican 'censorship' lawsuit paves the way for congressional investigations of Biden The challenge for Republicans will be to leave a broad range of voters, who had already shown little patience for GOP election denialism, with the impression that they are using the power granted to them in the midterms to address issues, like high inflation, that they care about. An out-of-control juggernaut of politicized investigations could harm the GOP by the time of the next election. New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who is expected to become the New Democratic leader after Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated last week she would step down, vowed Sunday to hold the new majority to account. \u201cWe will fiercely and vigorously oppose any attempts at Republican overreach and any Republican extremism,\u201d Jeffries told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the Republican leadership will take lessons away from the rejection of extremism by the American people all across the land, and not double and triple down on it in the next Congress.\u201d One goal of the new Republican majority, which will be closely attuned to Trump\u2019s wishes, is likely to be to frustrate or punish attempts by the Justice Department and FBI to investigate the former president, who launched his third consecutive presidential bid last week. And in the same way that McCarthy once implied the GOP\u2019s Benghazi investigations were intended to weaken former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential campaign, the GOP probes will also be taking aim at Biden\u2019s political prospects. GOP Rep. Jim Comer of Kentucky, the likely next head of the House Oversight Committee, indicated in a CNN interview last week that Republicans would try to connect Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in places like Ukraine to his father. Incoming GOP chair says House investigation into Trump's Mar-a-Lago documents 'will not be a priority' \u201cThis needs to be called the Biden investigation and not the Hunter Biden investigation,\u201d he said. Ian Sams, a spokesman for the White House Counsel\u2019s office, accused the GOP of seeking revenge and of mounting politically motivated attacks based on \u201clong-debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d But the spotlight being trained on Hunter Biden could prove especially painful in a personal sense for his father, whatever its political consequences. As well as congressional probes, federal authorities are weighing criminal charges against Hunter Biden over a gun purchase and tax issues. In an interview with Tapper last month, the president said he was a proud of his son, who he said had overcome a drug addiction. Trump\u2019s personal, political and legal exposure to investigations is far more tangible than the level of threat facing his successor. The appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith last week \u2013 to avoid the impression of political interference now that the former commander in chief is again an official candidate \u2013 is a mark of the breadth and seriousness of the legal complications that he is facing. Who is Jack Smith, the special counsel named in the Trump investigations Trump\u2019s early announcement of a 2024 bid was widely seen as partly an attempt to try to insulate himself against possible charges and to portray the investigations as a political vendetta against him. \u201cIt is not acceptable. It is so unfair. It is so political,\u201d the ex-president told Fox News Digital last week. He also warned that \u201cthe Republican Party has to stand up and fight\u201d \u2013 seeking to unite the GOP around him at a moment when his hold on the party is facing its biggest question in years over the poor performance of candidates he backed in the midterm elections. In the wake of the special counsel decision, several potential 2024 Republican rivals have endorsed the ex-president\u2019s claims that he is being politically targeted as some of them try to appeal to his base. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who has criticized Trump\u2019s conduct after the 2020 election in a string of recent interviews, called the appointment of a special counsel \u201cvery troubling\u201d in an interview with Fox. Another frequent Trump critic and possible 2024 GOP candidate, outgoing Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, said that the special counsel appointment was \u201cnot good news for our country.\u201d And Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a once and possible future GOP presidential candidate, said on his podcast that Biden had turned the United States into a banana republic by weaponizing the DOJ against the former president. (During his administration, Trump was repeatedly accused of weaponizing the Justice Department by using it to pursue his political ends and in seeking to influence its investigations \u2013 for example, in firing of former FBI Director James Comey.) Fact check: Trump responds to special counsel news with debunked claim about Obama and the Bushes Until the special counsel makes his decisions, the investigation into Trump will be a dominant backdrop to his presidential campaign. Already, Trump is using his timeworn tactic of smearing institutions that seek to probe or hold him to account \u2013 a process that inevitably damages them in the eyes of millions of his supporters. A decision on whether to indict a major presidential candidate will be one of the most fateful moments in the modern history of the DOJ and will have enormous legal and constitutional implications. But the investigation also poses a political threat to the former president. An unusual number of Republicans are increasingly willing to criticize him in public and to argue that the party should turn to another nominee in 2024. An indictment or just a long-running investigation could finally give Republicans, at least in its Washington establishment, an excuse to break with Trump in favor of an alternative candidate not tainted by scandal or caught up in election denialism and the January 6 insurrection.

            "article_content": "More than four months before voters handed Republicans control of the House of Representatives, top White House and Department of Homeland Security officials huddled in the Roosevelt Room to prepare for that very scenario. The department and its secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, had emerged as top targets of Republican ire over the Biden administration\u2019s border security policies \u2013 ire that is certain to fuel aggressive congressional investigations with Republicans projected to narrowly reclaim the House majority and the subpoena power that comes with it. Sitting around the large conference table in the Roosevelt Room, White House lawyers probed senior DHS officials about their preparations for the wide-ranging Republican oversight they had begun to anticipate, including Republicans\u2019 stated plans to impeach Mayorkas, two sources familiar with the meeting said. Convened by Richard Sauber, a veteran white-collar attorney hired in May to oversee the administration\u2019s response to congressional oversight, the meeting was one of several the White House has held since the summer with lawyers from across the administration \u2013 including the Defense Department, State Department and Justice Department. The point, people familiar with the effort said, has been to ensure agencies are ready for the coming investigative onslaught\u202f and to coordinate an administration-wide approach. While President Joe Biden and Democrats campaigned to preserve their congressional majorities, a small team of attorneys, communications strategists and legislative specialists have spent the past few months holed up in Washington preparing\u202ffor the alternative, two administration officials said. The preparations, largely run out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building near the White House, are among the earliest and most comprehensive by any administration ahead of a midterm election and highlight how far-reaching and aggressive Republican investigations are expected to be. Along with Sauber, this spring the White House hired veteran Democratic communications aide Ian Sams as spokesman for the White House counsel\u2019s office. Top Biden adviser Anita Dunn returned to the White House in the spring, in part to oversee the administration\u2019s preparations for a GOP-controlled Congress. The Justice Department is also bracing for investigations, bringing in well-known government transparency attorney Austin Evers to help respond to legislative oversight. Evers is the founder of the group American Oversight and served as its executive director until this year, and previously handled the oversight response at the State Department. The White House is preparing to hire additional lawyers and other staff to beef up its oversight response team in the next two months, before the new Congress convenes in January, administration officials said. The hires will bolster Sauber\u2019s current team of about 10 lawyers, a source familiar with the matter said. In\u202fpiecing together GOP targets and strategy, the team has\u202fpaid close attention\u202fto Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and James Comer of Kentucky, the two Republicans who are likely to lead much of the investigations under a GOP-controlled House and have spent months telegraphing their intentions in TV interviews and oversight letters. Their opening salvo came Thursday, when Comer and Jordan hosted a joint news conference to preview the various investigations into President Joe\u202fBiden\u2019s family. \u201cIn the 118th Congress, this committee will evaluate the status of Joe Biden\u2019s relationship with his family\u2019s foreign partners and whether he is a president who is compromised or swayed by foreign dollars and influence\u201d said Comer, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee. \u201cI want to be clear: This is an investigation of Joe Biden, and that\u2019s where the committee will focus in this next Congress.\u201d Comer, flanked by Jordan and other Republicans on the Oversight Committee, said Republicans have made connections between the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and the president whom they believe requires further investigation. The White House accused Comer of pursuing \u201clong-debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d Even though the Republican majority is poised to be much thinner than expected \u2013 with a likely margin of just a couple seats \u2013 all indications are that House Republicans are poised to push ahead with a wide-ranging set of investigations into all corners of the Biden administration, including the messy US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Covid-19 vaccine mandates and the Justice Department\u2019s handling of the various investigations related to Donald Trump. Republicans are also intent on investigating\u202fthe president\u2019s family, particularly his son, Hunter Biden. With little chance of passing much legislation in a deadlocked Congress, investigations are shaping up to be the focal point of how a House Republican majority wields its power. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have a bunch of chairmen who are totally on their own, doing whatever the hell they want without regard for what the national political implications are,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a former top adviser to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said he believes GOP leader Kevin McCarthy will have \u201cvery little leash\u201d to rein in those investigative pursuits. House Republicans have already sent over 500 letters to the administration requesting that they preserve documents, key committees have hired new legal counsels to help with investigations, and leadership has hosted classes for staffers on how to best use the oversight tools at their disposal. Republican 'censorship' lawsuit paves the way for congressional investigations of Biden Meanwhile, McCarthy\u2019s office has been working with likely committee chairs over the last several months to delegate who is going to be investigating what, according to a source familiar with the matter. \u201cIt\u2019s like a clearing house,\u201d the source said. But the GOP\u2019s push for aggressive investigations could run into resistance from the moderate wing of the GOP, who want to use their newfound majority to address key legislative priorities \u2013 not just pummel Hunter Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci. While McCarthy has vowed to conduct rigorous oversight, he will have to strike a delicate balance between the demands of the competing factions in his party. White House officials believe Republicans are bound to overstep and that their investigative overreach will backfire with the American public. In the meantime, they are prepared to  push back forcefully, believing that many proposed investigations are based on conspiracy theories and politically motivated charges. \u201cPresident Biden is not going to let these political attacks distract him from focusing on Americans\u2019 priorities, and we hope congressional Republicans will join us in tackling them instead of wasting time and resources on political revenge,\u201d Sams,\u202fthe spokesman for the White House counsel\u2019s office, said in a statement to CNN. The House\u2019s expected razor-thin majority is likely to make it more difficult to take steps like impeaching members of Biden\u2019s Cabinet \u2013 or even the president himself. But that doesn\u2019t mean, sources told CNN, they\u2019re not going to try, particularly when it comes to the border and Mayorkas. On Tuesday, the House Homeland Security Committee provided a preview of what is to come. Over the course of a marathon four-hour hearing, Republican lawmakers grilled Mayorkas over the influx of migrants at the southern border, the number of people who evade Border Patrol capture, and encounters with people on the border who are on the terror watch list. Throughout, Mayorkas stood his ground, maintaining that the border is \u201csecure\u201d and batting down criticism that it\u2019s \u201copen\u201d as Republicans have claimed. At one point, Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana foreshadowed more testimony next year, telling Mayorkas: \u201cWe look forward to seeing you in January.\u201d Mayorkas, officials said, remains undeterred by the threats of impeachment and intends to stay at the helm of the department, a point he reiterated Tuesday. Still, one person close to Mayorkas told CNN that the DHS chief is \u201cnervous\u201d about impending GOP investigations and the potential of being continually hauled before Congress by hostile Republican committee chairs. \u201cDon\u2019t let the bastards win,\u201d one US official familiar with Mayorkas\u2019 thinking said when asked to sum up the DHS chief\u2019s attitude toward potential GOP investigations on border issues and impeachment. \u201cWe will respond to legitimate inquiries,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to feed into what might wind up as kabuki theater.\u201d DHS already responds to hundreds of congressional inquiries per month, according to a Homeland Security official, who added the department has been preparing for months for any potential increase in congressional activity. The department is also ready to \u201caggressively respond to attempts to mischaracterize the strong record\u201d of the DHS work force, as well as \u201cpolitically motivated attempts to attack the secretary,\u201d the official said. DHS officials considered hiring outside legal counsel to prepare for the potential onslaught of Republican scrutiny but ultimately chose not to, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\u202f\u202f\u202fRicki Seidman, a senior counselor to Mayorkas and former senior Justice Department official, has been involved in DHS\u2019s preparation for the GOP oversight, the source added. Another Homeland Security official said that the Border Patrol along with Customs and Border Protection \u201care going to take the most heat.\u201d The most politically charged investigations next year are poised to be those into the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Top Republicans have largely been more than happy for Comer to take on the leading role of investigating Hunter Biden, multiple sources said.\u202f\u202fJordan does not plan to be intimately involved in the Hunter Biden probe but will provide public support for Comer, including appearing with him at the upcoming press conference. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lay out what we have thus far on Hunter Biden, and the crimes we believe he has committed,\u201d Comer told CNN earlier this month just before the election. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re going to be very clear and say what we are investigating, and who we\u2019re gonna ask to meet with us for transcribed interviews.\u201d Hunter Biden has denied wrongdoing in his business activities. Behind the scenes though, Jordan and other soon-to-be powerful Republican lawmakers \u2013 including likely chairman of House\u202fIntelligence Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio \u2013 have sought to distance their committees\u202ffrom the Hunter Biden investigation in favor of other investigative pursuits they deem to be \u201cmore serious,\u201d the sources said. The handling of Republican investigations related to Hunter Biden will fall to Hunter Biden\u2019s own attorneys, while Bob Bauer, the president\u2019s personal attorney, will handle related matters related to Joe Biden\u2019s personal capacity that do not touch on his official duties. Bauer, who is married to Dunn, and White House attorneys have already met to divvy up workflow over potential lines of inquiries to ensure there are clear lanes of responsibility between investigations that touch on Joe Biden\u2019s official role as president and vice president and his personal life. Another key point of interest is likely to be the administration\u2019s handling of the August 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, which led to the death of 13 Marines and nearly 200 Afghans when a bomb exploded at the Kabul airport. At the State Department,\u202fa small group of officials has already begun planning for the coming investigations into Afghanistan, officials said.\u202fWhile that group will work with Sauber\u2019s team at the White House, State Department officials expect to take the lead in handling GOP inquiries into Afghanistan. The department has not hired new people to work on these efforts, but certain officials who are already at the department expect to spend a lot more of their time responding to the congressional inquiries, officials said. The Republican investigation into the withdrawal is likely to be led by Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee. McCaul and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have historically had a good relationship, which State Department officials are hoping will be an important factor. Administration officials said they plan to take McCaul\u2019s inquiry seriously because they expect he will demonstrate a seriousness of purpose, instead of making bombastic demands like some other Republicans. And House Republican aides said they plan to explore the administration\u2019s willingness to work with them before issuing subpoenas. \u201cIf they\u2019ll meet us in the middle by giving us some documents instead of all documents, or agreeing to turn over certain individuals but not all of the individuals for interviews, then that\u2019s a start,\u201d said one of the GOP aides familiar with the plans. \u201cBut if they just want to be completely obstructive and say no to every single request, then you\u2019ll see subpoenas fairly soon.\u201d The department concluded its own review of the withdrawal in March, but the findings of that report have not been shared publicly, officials said. While it was expected to be put out earlier this year, State Department officials said the White House is making that determination, and they are unsure of where that decision stands. House Republicans want to see that report. At the Pentagon, officials are bracing for the possibility of public grilling at televised hearings on everything from Afghanistan to views about \u201cwokeness\u201d in the force and the discharging of troops who refused to take the Covid-19 vaccine. \u201cWe know it\u2019s coming,\u201d one administration official said. Both Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose term expires at the end of September 2023, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who appears determined to stay until the end of the Biden administration, have faced sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and know the coming months may be a rough political ride, officials said. Milley has been a particular target for Republicans for his well-known efforts to keep the final weeks of the Trump presidency from careening into a national security crisis. Both Milley and Austin have pushed back forcefully on GOP accusations that the military is \u201cwoke,\u201d a topic that\u2019s likely to become a focal point for some Republicans in the coming months. \u201cThis is going to be a Congress under Republican control like no other,\u201d said Rafi\u202fProber, a congressional investigations specialist with the law firm Akin Gump who previously worked in the Obama administration. Aaron Cutler, the head of the Washington government investigations group at law firm Hogan Lovells and a former Republican congressional leadership staffer, said the partisan investigations serve to \u201cfeed the base red meat.\u201d But Cutler said he has heard from conservatives that the tepid result for Republicans in the midterm elections may translate to less \u201csilliness in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American people are pushing back, and saying we want government to work.\u201d That is exactly the calculation the White House and congressional Democrats are making. A senior House Democratic source said that aggressive attacks on Biden\u2019s son could backfire, adding that congressional Democrats were gearing up to defend the president by calling out \u201clies and hypocrisy.\u201d Still, with the GOP investigations in mind, a team of White House lawyers has in recent weeks and months advised senior White House staff on how \u201cnot to be seen as influencing politically sensitive missions at (departments and agencies),\u201d a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Asked at his press conference last week about the prospect of GOP investigations, including into his son, Biden said: \u201cI think the American people will look at all of that for what it is. It\u2019s just almost comedy. \u2026 Look, I can\u2019t control what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from Rep. Comer on Thursday.

            "article_content": "Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow has seen this before. Nearly a dozen years ago when Barack Obama was president, a newly emboldened House GOP majority came to power, promising to rein in the Democratic agenda, cut spending and investigate a White House they believed had run rampant. What resulted: Years of intense feuding between the two parties and a government in gridlock as Washington careened from one potential fiscal crisis to the next. Now, as Democrats are poised to hold a narrow Senate majority \u2013 and Republicans are expecting a razor-thin House majority of their own \u2013 lawmakers in both parties have a deeply pessimistic view over the next two years and are bracing for an ugly period of legislating in Washington. \u201cIf Republicans in the House just intend to be the party of investigations and figuring out some reason to impeach President Biden, then they\u2019re going to pay a price in 2024,\u201d Stabenow said. Added Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from a Nebraska swing district: \u201cI perceive that there\u2019s a small group that is trying to put us in gridlock.\u201d House GOP leaders believe they were elected to stop the excesses of the Democratic agenda in the age of high inflation, fears about crime in the inner cities and problems at the US-Mexico border. And they plan to pass a series of bills on a range of issues important to their party, such as curtailing the Internal Revenue Service, ramping up security and imposing new voter ID laws \u2013 all messaging bills that will go nowhere in the Democratic-led Senate. But even passing such messaging bills will be complicated in a House run by Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican nominated by his party to be the next speaker. With an extremely slim majority, just a handful of defections could be enough to derail their messaging bills. Making life even harder, McCarthy has vowed to end the remote voting system put in place during the pandemic \u2013 a tool that proved crucial for Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s slim majority whenever absences popped up. So McCarthy will have to balance the demands of some 40 members on his right flank with the concerns of more than 30 Republicans who hail from swing districts that gave him the majority. More concerning, according to more than a dozen lawmakers in both parties, is how Congress will deal with the basic necessity of government: Funding federal agencies and raising the national borrowing limit to avoid an unprecedented debt default \u2013 a perennially dicey issue in Washington that is often used as a bargaining chip and puts Congress on edge. Many expect those must-pass issues to be used as leverage against Democrats across the Capitol and down Pennsylvania Avenue. Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, predicted there would be a strong appetite in the GOP to use their leverage in any funding fights to boost their own priorities, such as securing the border \u2013 even if it meant shutting down the government, adding \u201cabsolutely\u201d there\u2019s a concern over dealing with those fiscal issues. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever really liked (government shutdowns),\u201d Mast told CNN. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re in a different state of play right now, where people will be, in part, pining for government shutdowns.\u201d Yet some hardliners are already preparing to lay the blame for any turmoil at the feet of Democrats and President Joe Biden. Rep. Bob Good, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said that if the GOP-led House passes a spending bill that the Senate won\u2019t take up or president won\u2019t sign, the \u201cconsequences lie with them.\u201d As legislating will be difficult, the investigations in the House will take center stage. For months, House Republicans have been privately plotting their investigative roadmap \u2013 looking into everything from the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, the origins of Covid-19, border problems and the foreign business dealings of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Yet some Republicans fear that\u2019s the wrong approach. Inside the White House's months of prep-work for a GOP investigative onslaught \u201cI\u2019d rather focus on helping the American people, dealing with inflation, getting better energy resources, making sure entitlements are secure going forward,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, told CNN. \u201cThere are a lot of high priorities, and, frankly, looking into the president\u2019s son doesn\u2019t strike me as one of the big priorities we ought to be focused on.\u201d Romney added: \u201cI know there are some in the base that only want to fight. There are others in the country that want us to get stuff done. I happen to be in the latter category.\u201d One Republican lawmaker warned his party against allowing chaos to erupt on their watch. \u201cI may offer a hazardous activity clause to the Republican Conference rules package: No dangerous activity for the next two years,\u201d quipped Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a North Dakota Republican. \u201cI\u2019m looking into \u2018Armstrong For Congress\u2019 shower mats for the whole conference. We can\u2019t afford a slip and fall right now.\u201d Just as the hard-right flank is emboldened by the election results, so are moderates in both parties. To stay in power after 2024, GOP leaders will need to protect at least 15 members from districts that former President Donald Trump narrowly carried \u2013 in addition to the roughly 16 from districts Biden won in 2020. Given the margins and that political reality, members in the middle of their respective parties feel emboldened by the midterm results. What Republicans plan to do with their new House majority As the reality of a razor-thin Republican House majority sank in, two lawmakers who lead a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans sat down for dinner to discuss a pressing issue: how to govern in what is expected to be a chaotic environment in Washington over the next two years. GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chairs of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus, told CNN they discussed how their alliance could help mitigate the problems of slim margins that can empower any single member to derail the legislative process. Fitzpatrick, who hails from a district that Biden carried by five points in 2020, will be on the speed dial of every Democrat looking for a compromise or help scuttling the GOP agenda, according to a Democratic source. \u201cWith a narrow margin, I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of compromise,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see compromise within the conference, and you\u2019re going see compromise across the aisle as well.\u201d Gottheimer added: \u201cThat\u2019s one of the lessons from this election. That\u2019s why Democrats overperformed. People don\u2019t want the extremism and the yelling. They want us to find common ground.\u201d Bacon, whose district Biden won by six, added: \u201cWe can\u2019t have four or five people just saying no and shutting down the whole thing.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s allies have already tried to convince moderate Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar to switch parties in hopes of padding their slim margin. Cuellar flatly rejected the idea after a competitive primary and general election in his district, but he\u2019s already being courted by Republicans who may need his help in a narrow GOP majority. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to a whole bunch of Republicans on the floor, we only had one vote, but I stayed there for a while,\u201d Cuellar said after a series of votes. \u201cWell, I think we can work together on a lot of things.\u201d Yet cutting bipartisan deals is a recipe for a revolt on the right \u2013 as was the case as the Senate cut a slew of bipartisan deals this Congress over gun control, infrastructure and semiconductor chip production, only to be opposed by McCarthy, his leadership team and most of the House GOP Conference. \u201cYou can\u2019t lose anybody, right? Any one person becomes kind of an island to themselves that they get to say, \u2018give me this or else that,\u2019 \u201d Mast said of the new power dynamics. GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take very many flies to spoil the broth.\u201d A group of far-right Republicans, namely from the Freedom Caucus, is pushing for a number of rules changes in the new Congress that could make it even more difficult to govern, such as requiring any bills that are brought to the floor to have support from the majority of the majority party. House Republicans met Wednesday to begin hashing out their rules package for the new Congress. Analysis: Kevin McCarthy's 218 problem Notably, GOP lawmakers adopted an amendment to require a majority of the entire conference to agree on forcing a floor vote to oust a sitting speaker \u2013 something that could make it more difficult to push out McCarthy if he wins the speakership. Members of the House Freedom Caucus wanted individual lawmakers to be able to force such a vote. The procedural weapon was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he eventually resigned. Freedom Caucus member Chip Roy, who has forced numerous procedural votes to delay floor activity, including on non-controversial bills with broad bipartisan support, told CNN members should not be afraid to hold long vote series in the GOP majority. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of voting. Right? \u2026 Well, hells bells. We get sent here to vote. So everybody calm down,\u201d Roy, a Texas Republican, said. Other Republicans say that the far-right faction should be aware that others in the conference also hold the power. \u201cThe Freedom Caucus is making a lot of noise, but they don\u2019t hold all the cards,\u201d said Rep. David Joyce, an Ohio Republican, referring to the far-right faction. Joyce added: \u201cIt was hard to govern when we had a large majority. We have many independent agents. It\u2019s like herding cats trying to get everybody together.\u201d CNN\u2019s Daniella Diaz, Morgan Rimmer and Ethan Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, already a master at sidestepping questions about his political future, is proving equally adept at tiptoeing around Donald Trump as he builds a case for his party\u2019s nomination in 2024. As Trump staged the unveiling of a third presidential campaign, DeSantis in public and behind closed doors this week has avoided directly responding to the former president \u2013 or even mentioning him by name \u2013 while still drawing sharp contrasts between the two Republican figures. Momentum -- and planning -- for DeSantis 2024 bid takes off after resounding Florida win Speaking in Lee County on Wednesday, DeSantis called for people asking about his brewing rivalry with Trump to \u201cchill out a little bit.\u201d He then pivoted immediately to touting his own performance in last week\u2019s midterm elections compared to the \u201csubstandard performance\u201d of the GOP in the rest of the country, where Trump\u2019s involvement has become the focal point of many Republicans\u2019 recriminations. The day before, DeSantis spoke to a group of Republican donors in Orlando, Florida, where he touted his 19-point win in his reelection. DeSantis outlined his electoral strength in the suburbs, his rural turnout effort and his appeal among Latino voters in his victorious reelection effort, according to a person who was in the room. DeSantis didn\u2019t bring up Trump, who days before the election had claimed credit for turning Florida into a red state. The group of about 250, which included donors to the Republican Governors Association as well as governors and their spouses, gave DeSantis a standing ovation at the end of his conversation with outgoing Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts. The person in the room told CNN that DeSantis walked through in detail where he performed well across the state, including winning traditionally Democratic Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. DeSantis\u2019 remarks this week provide an early window into his strategy for navigating Trump ahead of a potential primary matchup. Those close to the Florida governor believe he does not intend to announce his plans before May, CNN previously reported. In the meantime, they expect him to avoid direct confrontations with the former president. The size of his victory last week has earned DeSantis national praise from Republicans who are looking for someone to emerge as an alternative to Trump who can vanquish the former president and compete in a general election. But DeSantis has largely steered clear of that chatter. Instead, emboldened by his 1.5 million-vote win, he is staking out plans for a second-term agenda that will continue to galvanize supporters. When asked by Ricketts what he would like to work on with Republican governors, DeSantis said he was looking to take on the growth of so-called environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investment funds as well as improving border security, this person said. DeSantis dismisses 'noise' when asked about Trump's criticism of him \u201cTrump rants for a couple of months. DeSantis throws some red meat during [Florida\u2019s next legislative session] and then we have a primary around May,\u201d said one DeSantis ally, describing his current posture. Trump has wasted no time taking aim directly at his former ally. Trump coined a nickname for DeSantis and called him \u201can average Republican governor\u201d in a blistering statement that included unfounded claims he sent the FBI to ensure DeSantis won his election four years ago. Ahead of announcing the launch of his presidential campaign Tuesday, Trump resurfaced a 2018 campaign ad from DeSantis in which Casey DeSantis touts Trump\u2019s endorsement while Ron DeSantis builds a wall out of blocks with his daughter and reads \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d to his infant son. \u201cThanks, Ron!\u201d Trump wrote. Asked about Trump\u2019s broadsides, DeSantis on Tuesday more broadly addressed the criticism he faces as \u201cnoise.\u201d \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned in this job: When you\u2019re leading and getting things done, you take incoming fire,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the nature of it.\u201d But he added: \u201cI just tell people to check out the scoreboard last Tuesday night.\u201d This headline and story have been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "Winning the House majority, even with a smaller margin than they\u2019d hoped, will give Republicans some newfound power to set the agenda when they take over the chamber in January. House Republicans will have subpoena power in the majority and control over powerful committees \u2013 and they plan to make investigations into the Biden administration a top priority. On the legislative front, there will be some must-pass policy issues \u2013 like funding the government \u2013 that will test the ability of Republicans and Democrats to work together. House Republicans are eyeing potential probes into everything from the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan, border policies being overseen by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, business dealings involving President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and the bureaucratic decision-making behind Covid-related school closures and vaccine mandates. House Republicans may also use their majority to push a counter-narrative around the January 6, 2021, attack in an attempt to shift blame away from former President Donald Trump after a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol. Even before the party clinched the House majority, some of the investigative groundwork laid out by Republican officials had started to come to fruition. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday, for instance, ordered an FBI cybersecurity official to be deposed in a lawsuit alleging that the FBI coerced social media companies to block stories about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop ahead of the 2020 election. The FBI deposition is one of several sought by the state Republican officials in a lawsuit accusing Biden officials of effectively enforcing government censorship by pushing social media companies to, among other things, police speech about the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, the efficacy of face masks and health care measures intended to curb the spread of the virus, as well as claims about election integrity and the security of voting by mail. It\u2019s not yet clear how far House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is willing to go when it comes to January 6 and the 2020 presidential election. And some Republicans argue that the party would be better served by moving past 2020. Some other investigative ideas under consideration among House Republicans include establishing a select committee on China \u2013 a longtime priority for McCarthy. The GOP conference voted for McCarthy to be its leader on Tuesday, setting him up to be the next speaker assuming he wins 218 votes, or a majority of the House, when the full chamber votes in January. The president can exercise veto power over legislation, but House Republicans will still be able to push some messaging bills that highlight their agenda. In an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, two days before the midterm elections, McCarthy outlined his plans for power, which includes tackling inflation, rising crime and border security \u2013 three issues that have become central to Republicans\u2019 closing pitch to voters. McCarthy also left the door open to launching eventual impeachment proceedings, which some of his members have already begun to call for. During a private intraparty meeting on Monday ahead of leadership elections, McCarthy promised he would strip power from Democrats, vowing to kick Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar off the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and California Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff off the House Intelligence Committee, according to a source in the room. \u201cThey don\u2019t give out gavels in small, medium, and large \u2013 we have the majority and we have the gavels,\u201d McCarthy said Monday, during the meeting. But Republicans\u2019 slim majority will stand in the way of most \u2013 if not all \u2013 of their priorities in the chamber. McCarthy\u2019s allies have recently attempted to convince moderate Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas to switch parties in hopes of padding their slim margins, according to two sources familiar with the conversation. Cuellar flatly rejected the idea. CNN\u2019s Evan Perez and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump made it official Tuesday night: He is running for president again. He announced his candidacy at Mar-a-Lago in a speech that ran more than an hour. I went through the transcript and pulled out the lines you need to see. 1. \u201cThere has never been anything like it, this great movement of ours. Never been anything like it, and perhaps there will never be anything like it again.\u201d Modesty, thy name is Donald Trump. And away we go! 2. \u201cTogether we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\u201d This is an oldie-but-goodie from Trump\u2019s 2020 stump speech. And it\u2019s still not true. 3. \u201cMany people think that because of this, China played a very active role in the 2020 election. Just saying.\u201d Trump here is suggesting that because his administration was hard on China that China somehow meddled in the 2020 election. There isn\u2019t \u2013 as you probably already guessed \u2013 any evidence to back up that claim. 4. \u201cThe vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.\u201d \u201cBy me.\u201d 5. \u201cAnd yet I\u2019ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.\u201d Er, he was president for four years. So \u2026 6. \u201cNow we are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation.\u201d USA! USA! 7. \u201cOur southern border has been erased and our country is being invaded by millions and millions of unknown people, many of whom are entering for a very bad and sinister reason. And you know what that reason is.\u201d I actually don\u2019t know what that reason is. 8. \u201cThe blood-soaked streets of our once-great cities are cesspools of violent crimes.\u201d Um \u2026 9. \u201cAnd Ukraine, which would have never happened if I were your president.\u201d This harks back to what Trump said during the 2016 Republican National Convention: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d 10. \u201cThanks to the words of wisdom, he said \u2018thank you\u2019 to the wrong country for inviting him to a major summit.\u201d Joe Biden made a verbal flub recently at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, thanking the prime minister of Colombia when he meant Cambodia. 11. \u201cYou cannot mention the nuclear word. It\u2019s too devastating.\u201d He just mentioned it. 12. \u201cUnder Biden and the radical Democrats, America has been mocked, derided and brought to its knees, perhaps like never before.\u201d This is a central theme of Trumpism and is likely to be a major talking point on the 2024 campaign trail. He is creating an image of America as a supplicant, begging other countries for things when we should be dominating them. He ran on that same message, to considerable effect, in 2016. 13. \u201cI believe the American people will overwhelmingly reject the left\u2019s platform of national ruin.\u201d Democrats are running on a platform of \u201cnational ruin\u201d? 14. \u201cMuch criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better. And frankly, much of this blame is correct.\u201d To be clear: Trump doesn\u2019t accept any blame for what happened in the midterm elections. He is saying here that people blaming other Republicans for the party\u2019s performance are right. 15.  \u201cI do want to point out that in the midterms, my endorsement success rate was 232 wins and only 22 losses.\u201d Like I said, he doesn\u2019t accept any blame. It\u2019s also worth pointing out here that Trump endorsed a lot of Republican candidates who were heavy favorites \u2013 padding his win-loss record. 16. \u201cThis is an elegant night and an elegant place.\u201d \u201cElegant\u201d is one word for it. 17. \u201cI\u2019m not going to use the term \u2018fake news media.\u2019 So we\u2019re going to keep it very elegant.\u201d He just used the term. And I am going to start keeping things \u201cvery elegant\u201d from here on out. 18. \u201cDespite the outcome in the Senate, we cannot lose hope and we must all work very hard for a gentleman and a great person named Herschel Walker.\u201d Many leading Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, had urged Trump to delay his 2024 announcement until after the Georgia Senate runoff election on December 6. Trump, um, did not take that advice. 19. \u201cI said, \u2018If you just keep a little bit lower standard, you\u2019re going to have a big victory.\u2019\u201d This is Trump trying to spin the election results \u2013 in which Republicans drastically underperformed expectations \u2013 into a victory. 20. \u201cThere are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying, \u2018Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.\u2019\u201d Trump appears to be referring to a false 2020 report on a satirical website that Biden confused Iowa and Idaho. That story has been debunked. 21. \u201cIn order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.\u201d \u201cGlorious.\u201d 22. \u201cSome people say, \u2018How do you speak before so many people all the time?\u2019 When there\u2019s love in the room, it\u2019s really easy, if you want to know the truth.\u201d Do people really say that? 23. \u201cIf you look at the numbers, if you look at what\u2019s happened with Hispanic, with African American, with Asian, and just look at what\u2019s happening.\u201d Um \u2026 24.\u201d This will not be my campaign. This will be our campaign.\u201d This is a good line. Probably Trump\u2019s best of the speech. 25. \u201cAnd we love both sides.\u201d Trump spent the bulk of his speech up until this point declaring that Democrats have run the country into the ground. And yet, he loves them? 26. \u201cWe\u2019re going to unify people. And it was happening in the previous administration, previous to the previous.\u201d \u201cPrevious to the previous.\u201d 27. \u201cPrior to Covid coming in, the people were calling me. \u2026 You wouldn\u2019t believe it, people that were so far-left, I figured they\u2019d never speak to me and I would never speak to them.\u201d Trump seems to be claiming here that very liberal people were calling him, pre-Covid, to tell him what an amazing job he was doing. Which, well, probably not. 28. \u201cWe call it the China virus.\u201d He calls it the \u201cChina virus.\u201d 29. \u201d So, from now until Election Day, and 2024 which will come very quickly, we\u2019ll go look at how time flies.\u201d Uh \u2026 just 720 days to go! 30. \u201cAnd I say that not in laughter, I say that in tears.\u201d \u201cI really can\u2019t say, I guess I laugh to keep from crying.\u201d \u2013 Q Tip 31. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be critics. We don\u2019t want to be complainers. I never wanted to be a critic.\u201d He said this with a straight face. 32. \u201cEverybody will agree with us because everybody sees what a bad job has been done during this two-year period, and it will be a four-year period.\u201d By 2024, everyone will agree with Trump! 33. \u201cI didn\u2019t need this. I had a nice easy life.\u201d This is a regular Trump refrain. The notion is that he is only running because the problems facing the country are so great and only he can fix them.  That his campaign is somehow a selfless act. 34. \u201cI was with President Xi, who\u2019s now president for life. I call him \u2018king.\u2019 He said, \u2018No, no, I\u2019m not the king.\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes, you are the king. You\u2019re president for life. It\u2019s the same thing.\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s admiration for someone who can be \u201cpresident for life\u201d comes through here loud and clear. 35. \u201cNobody\u2019s remembering her now.\u201d Trump is talking here about former German Chancellor Angela Merkel who, apparently, no one remembers anymore. 36. \u201cYou can\u2019t get anything. And good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving.\u201d Sorry, folks. Thanksgiving is canceled! See you next year! 37. \u201cYou\u2019ve been standing for the for the whole event. I feel very guilty. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d [narrator voice] He doesn\u2019t feel guilty. 38. \u201cWe built the wall. We completed the wall. And then we said, \u2018Let\u2019s do more,\u2019 and we did a lot more. Trump did not complete the border wall. 39. \u201cThe cities are rotting, and they are indeed cesspools of blood.\u201d Well, that\u2019s an image! 40. \u201cIn the caravans. I love the name. I came up with it. I love the name.\u201d Donald Trump invented the word \u201ccaravan\u201d? 41. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more blue-ribbon committees.\u201d The war on blue-ribbon committees begins today! 42. \u201cIf you get caught dealing drugs, you have an immediate and quick trial. And by the end of the day, you\u2019re executed. That\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d Trump is describing how drug dealers are treated in China. And if you think he actually thinks it\u2019s a bad thing, I have a video rental company named Blockbuster that is a hot stock you might be interested in. 43. \u201cThat\u2019s the only answer, no more \u2018blue ribbon.\u2019 I refuse to create them anymore.\u201d Yes, you\u2019ve said that. 44. \u201cMy people told me, \u2018Sir, that\u2019s politically incorrect to say.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll say it anyway, if you don\u2019t mind.\u2019\u201d Always be wary when Trump starts with \u201csir.\u201d 45. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think of myself as a politician, but I guess that\u2019s what I am. I hate that thought.\u201d He said this after announcing his third bid for the White House. 46. \u201cI\u2019m a victim. I will tell you.\u201d Again, yes, he said this with a straight face. 47. \u201cThey spend all of the money for machines and all of this stuff and they end up two weeks later, three weeks later, by that time everyone forgot there was even at election.\u201d Donald Trump: Not a fan of machines. 48. \u201cOur country was great. Our country is not great anymore.\u201d USA! USA! 49. \u201cAnyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand.\u201d \u201cStorm of Fire\u201d was the name of my second album. 50. \u201cI think he got more subpoenas than any man in the history of our country.\u201d Trump is talking about his son Eric here. And yes, it\u2019s weird to single him out so you can tout the number of subpoenas he\u2019s received. 51. \u201cI go home and she says, \u2018You look angry and upset.\u2019 I say, \u2018Just leave me alone.\u2019\u201d Trump is referring to his wife here. Marital bliss, ladies and gentlemen! Yeah, this feels like a good place to end.",

            "article_content": "US President Joe Biden emerged from an emergency meeting with top allies during his final day at the G20 in Indonesia promising to \u201cfigure out exactly what happened\u201d after a Russian-made missile fell inside the borders of a NATO ally. \u201cWe agreed to support Poland\u2019s investigations into the explosion in rural Poland near the Ukrainian border and we\u2019re gonna make sure we figure out exactly what happened,\u201d Biden told reporters following his emergency roundtable with leaders at the G20 Summit. Biden added, \u201cThen we\u2019re gonna collectively determine next step as we investigate.\u201d The president had just exited the meeting in Bali on Wednesday morning local time. The talks came after Poland\u2019s foreign ministry said late Tuesday that the \u201cRussian-made missile\u201d fell on the village of Przewod\u00f3w. On Wednesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the missile that landed in Poland on Tuesday was \u201cprobably an accident\u201d from the Ukrainian side while intercepting incoming Russian missiles. The statement appeared to confirm something that Biden alluded to earlier when speaking to the press after being asked if the missile was fired from Russia. \u201cThere is preliminary information that contests that,\u201d he answered. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that until we completely investigate. It\u2019s unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d The Russian Defense Ministry had denied that there were strikes made on targets near the Ukrainian-Polish state border. Biden and leaders from the G7 and NATO were in the roundtable. The meeting included Biden and leaders from Canada, the European Union, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Japan, the officials said. The president said that there was \u201ctotal unanimity among folks at the table\u201d about how to respond to the incident. He did not provide other information about the source of the missile. During a call with Duda earlier, Biden \u201cexpressed deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland earlier this evening,\u201d the White House said in a readout. \u201cPresident Duda described Poland\u2019s ongoing assessment of the explosion that took place in the eastern part of the country near the border with Ukraine. President Biden offered full US support for and assistance with Poland\u2019s investigation,\u201d the readout continued. Biden \u201creaffirmed the United States\u2019 ironclad commitment to NATO\u201d and the leaders agreed to have their teams \u201cremain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as the investigation proceeds.\u201d At the summit, Biden and most G20 members have been slated to sign onto a statement condemning Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine \u201cand the human suffering it has caused both for Ukrainians and for families in the developing world that are facing food and fuel insecurity as a result,\u201d according to a senior administration official previewing the statement. Such an expression of condemnation has been the work of months of diplomacy between G20 leaders. However, it\u2019s not clear yet exactly which countries will sign onto the declaration. Before beginning a long journey back to Washington, Biden participated in a mangrove tree planting with other G20 leaders. He also met with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom for the first time since Sunak took office last month. Sunak ascended to the prime minister role late last month when he replaced Liz Truss, now the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history. Truss resigned six weeks into a term that plunged Britain into political and economic turmoil. Sunak is the first person of color and the first Hindu to lead the UK. He is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years. White House officials were expecting a split screen moment this week as Biden met world leaders in Bali at the same moment his predecessor was announcing a third presidential run. But the dynamic was amplified as Biden convened the emergency talks at the same hour Trump loyalists filled the Mar-a-Lago ballroom for former President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement. Biden was leading the crisis talks with members of the G7 and NATO in Bali \u2013 two groupings Trump questioned the usefulness of when he was in office. Less than 10 minutes after he finished speaking to reporters, Trump walked on stage at Mar-a-Lago. Heading into the trip, Biden\u2019s advisers were not particularly concerned about the split-screen and, after Democrats\u2019 better-than-expected midterm elections, were even less wary of Trump announcing a third bid for president while Biden was in Asia. For one, Biden officials are happy to take the comparison between the current president and the former on the foreign stage, given the general chaos that often trailed Trump as he traveled abroad. Biden\u2019s team also believe the president\u2019s newfound acclaim among Democrats compares favorably to Trump\u2019s post-midterms status within the Republican Party \u2014 still an evolving picture, but showing signs of erosion. Trump\u2019s announcement will surely prompt renewed attention on Biden\u2019s on decision-making on running for reelection. By all accounts, including from his closest advisers, Biden will feel more propelled to seek a second term if Trump is in contention. Throughout the course of his meetings in Asia this week, Biden has been approached by fellow leaders bearing congratulations following the midterm results, a signal the American political contests were being closely monitored by leaders on the opposite side of the world. It was a phenomenon that surprised some of his aides, particularly the specificity with which many of the leaders were watching. It was a sign, according to one senior administration official, that the stakes of the midterm elections extended well beyond US borders. Biden himself had framed the contest as putting democracy on the ballot \u2014 stakes that leaders in foreign capitals were highly attuned to as they work to determine which way the political winds are blowing in the United States. Ahead of the elections, foreign diplomats posted to Washington traveled the country working to suss out the political temperature, all with the goal of determining whether Trump could be poised for a political comeback. If the collection of election deniers and Trump acolytes vying for office amounted to a signal that the former president\u2019s influence was still alive within Republican politics \u2013 and that his return to the White House remained a distinct possibility \u2013 the widespread rejection of those candidates last week sent an alternate signal abroad. For Biden, the timing could not have been more opportune. The prospect of a midterm wipeout loomed over preparations for his around-the-world trip over the last several weeks. Widespread Republican wins \u2013 including by election deniers \u2013 would badly complicate the president\u2019s bedrock message that Democracies will win out against autocracies. Trump\u2019s tease of a campaign announcement at the very moment Biden would be rallying the world behind democratic ideals only elevated the stakes.",

US Customs and Border Protection commissioner resigns \u201cI hope, for the sake of the safety of the American people, that that conversation happens very soon,\u201d LaTurner said. Over the course of the hearing, Mayorkas maintained that the border is \u201csecure\u201d and batted down criticism that it\u2019s \u201copen\u201d as Republicans have claimed, saying that the Biden administration continues to implement a Trump-era pandemic restriction that allows for the swift expulsion of migrants. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious challenge,\u201d Mayorkas said, stressing that it\u2019s a \u201cchallenge that is not specific or exclusive to our southern border. This is a challenge that exists throughout the hemisphere.\u201d The top Republican on the panel, John Katko of New York, focused on the increased number of migrants at the US-Mexico border. \u201cIn the first two years of the Biden administration, we have seen a disturbing trend become a catastrophic humanitarian crisis at the border,\u201d he said. Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana also foreshadowed the next term, telling Mayorkas: \u201cWe look forward to seeing you in January.\u201d The US Border Patrol made over 2.2 million arrests in fiscal year 2022 for unlawful crossings on the US-Mexico border, the highest annual number of apprehensions on record, amid mass migration in the Western hemisphere. Over a million of those encountered at the border have also been turned back to Mexico or their home countries. US border crossings also increased slightly last month compared to September, according to newly released US Customs and Border Protection data, though authorities saw a drop in Venezuelan migrants crossing unlawfully. The hearing came on the heels of the resignation of US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus, who had been asked to resign by Mayorkas last week. Magnus had been criticized internally for being out of touch with the agency and publicly for the handling of the US-Mexico border. During his tenure, officials also told CNN they believed Magnus seemed disengaged and wasn\u2019t joining some internal meetings at a critical time for the agency. CBP Deputy Commissioner Troy Miller is now serving as the acting commissioner. The hearing also touched on international terrorism, domestic terrorism, cyber threats, and election security. FBI Director Christopher Wray and National Counterterrorism Center Director Christine Abizaid testified alongside Mayorkas. Mayorkas stressed the \u201cevolving terrorism threat\u201d that now includes \u201clone actors fueled by a wide range of violent extremist ideologies and grievances, including domestic violent extremists.\u201d \u201cFrom cyberattacks on our critical infrastructure to increasing destabilizing efforts by hostile nation states, the threats facing the homeland have never been greater or more complex,\u201d he said. Mayorkas also cited efforts by Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea as \u201chostile nations\u201d targeting infrastructure through cyberattacks. There were only a handful of documented cyberattacks aimed at election-related infrastructure on Election Day, but nothing that kept people from casting their vote, according to US officials. But foreign influence activity \u2013 the use of social media or other means to sway voters \u2013 is harder to measure. Bullish on a House takeover, GOP's investigative plans on Hunter Biden and others pick up steam But Jen Easterly, the head of US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has expressed concern over foreign operatives using the days and week between Election Day and when votes are certified \u2013 including the leadup to next month\u2019s Senate runoff in Georgia \u2013 to further amplify disinformation about voting and sow discord among Americans. Meanwhile, terrorism threats to the US have shifted over the years, with officials more and more concerned about lone actors inspired by ideologies online rather than foreign-directed and planned attacks. Mayorkas said Tuesday that it \u201ccontinues to be our assessment\u201d that domestic violent extremism poses the most lethal and persistent terrorism related threat to the United States. \u201cDomestic violent extremism, particularly through lone actors or small groups loosely affiliated, are spurred to violence by ideologies of hate, anti-government sentiments, personal grievances, and other narratives propagated on online platforms,\u201d he said. Wray echoed those concerns, saying that going back to the summer of 2019, there has been an increase in domestic violent extremism. The FBI is concerned about the lethality, especially of racially motivated violent extremists, as well as the spike that started in 2020, of anti-government and anti-authority violent extremism, Wray said. Wray also said that there\u2019s been a trend over the last \u201cseveral years\u201d of people turning to violence to manifest frustrations. \u201cThat\u2019s a very dangerous trend,\u201d he said when asked by Rep. Donald Payne Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, how officials are assessing threats against public figures given the recent attack against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband. Mayorkas noted how that trend also applies to law enforcement. \u201cThis year has seen the greatest number of ambushes against law enforcement officers,\u201d Mayorkas said.

            "article_content": "Democrat Katie Hobbs will win Arizona\u2019s governor\u2019s race, CNN projects, defeating one of the most prominent defenders of former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Calling the 2020 election rigged, Republican Kari Lake had repeatedly said she would not have certified Joe Biden\u2019s win in Arizona in 2020. Hobbs, as Arizona\u2019s secretary of state, had rejected GOP lies about the election. Lake\u2019s defeat follows the defeat of two other high-profile election deniers in the state \u2013 Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters and secretary of state nominee Mark Finchem. \u201cDemocracy is worth the wait,\u201d Hobbs tweeted after the race was called Monday night. \u201cThank you, Arizona. I am so honored and so proud to be your next Governor.\u201d Lake did not acknowledge Hobbs\u2019 victory, instead tweeting, \u201cArizonans know BS when they see it.\u201d   The Republican nominee had already begun sowing doubts about the 2022 results. During an appearance on Fox News Monday before the race was called, Lake baselessly called the election \u201cbotched.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe that people of Arizona would vote for her and that she would win. But if that\u2019s what happens at the end of the day, how could you certify an election that is this botched?\u201d Lake said. During an appearance on right-wing activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s talk show Thursday, she said, \u201cI hate that they\u2019re slow-rolling and dragging their feet and delaying the inevitable. They don\u2019t want to put out the truth, which is that we won.\u201d There is no evidence that the election officials were delaying the reporting of results. At a news conference Thursday, Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, called out Lake\u2019s comments. \u201cIt is offensive for Kari Lake to say that these people behind me are slow-rolling this when they are working 14-18 hours,\u201d Gates, a Republican, said, gesturing to the election workers who were involved in tallying the ballots behind him through a glass window. Lake had continued to stoke questions about the vote tabulation and Hobbs\u2019 eventual role in certifying the vote as secretary of state hours before the race was projected for Hobbs. \u201cShouldn\u2019t election officials be impartial,\u201d Lake tweeted, a reference to the office that Hobbs holds. \u201cThe guys running the Election have made it their mission to defeat America First Republicans. Unbelievable.\u201d Arizona Assistant Secretary of State Allie Bones refuted Lake\u2019s suggestion that Hobbs should recuse herself from overseeing the election. In an interview with CNN Monday night, she noted that Arizona elections are \u201chighly decentralized\u201d and the \u201ccounties are responsible for administering the elections and tabulating the votes.\u201d What to know about control of Congress and outstanding votes in other races When pressed by CNN\u2019s John King about exactly what the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s role is in certifying the election, Bones said the process has worked the same way for years: all 15 counties will report their results to the secretary of state\u2019s office, then the secretary\u2019s office compiles those results and puts together the state-wide canvass. At that point \u201cthe secretary does sign off on that,\u201d Bones said, but the governor, the attorney general and the chief justice of the state Supreme Court will also sign off on those final results. Lake, a former news anchor at Fox 10 in Phoenix, ascended quickly to become one of the most prominent Republicans in the 2022 cycle as she and Hobbs vied to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. The outgoing governor had endorsed Lake\u2019s primary opponent, but then backed Lake in the general election. Hobbs, a former social worker who worked with victims of domestic violence before becoming a state lawmaker, ran a far more low-key and understated campaign, limiting her access to reporters and holding small, intimate events with supporters. She made democracy and abortion rights her central focus, portraying Lake as an \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d figure who could jeopardize the sanctity of the 2024 presidential election by refusing to certify the results. She had help in the latter effort from GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, whose political action committee put $500,000 behind an ad urging Arizona voters to reject Lake and Finchem. Lake subsequently posted a sarcastic letter on Twitter thanking Cheney for her \u201cin-kind contribution\u201d \u2013 claiming the ad was actually helping her campaign. On Monday night when the race was called for Hobbs, Cheney responded to Lake\u2019s October 28 tweet with a simple retort: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Barrett Marson, an Arizona GOP consultant who worked for Masters during the Senate primary, spoke to the wisdom of following Trump Monday night. \u201cIt\u2019s over. The only thing Kari Lake should do now is graciously concede. This election tells us one thing: following Trump over the cliff will not win elections.\u201d Democratic gubernatorial winners in swing states have message for national party Lake hewed closely to the Trump playbook on more than just the 2020 election. She promised to declare an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the border \u2013 in what she described as an effort to amass greater power for the governor\u2019s office to address the migrant crisis \u2013 and she called for the arrest of both of Dr. Anthony Fauci and her Democratic opponent. Before announcing her bid, Lake left her anchor job in 2021 \u2013 stating that she didn\u2019t like the direction that journalism was going \u2013 after becoming a household name in Phoenix. In one of her campaign videos, she said she was taking a sledgehammer to \u201cleftist lies and propaganda,\u201d as she destroyed television sets with the tool in stiletto boots. She dispatched her primary opponents with her forceful denunciations of Democratic leaders\u2019 handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 blasting restrictions like masking as unnecessary and harmful to children. She welcomed comparisons to Trump all the way through the end of the campaign \u2013 professing at one event that she was delighted when one admirer called her \u201cTrump in a dress.\u201d Lake had painted Hobbs as a coward after Hobbs refused to debate her opponent this fall. Hobbs\u2019 campaign argued that a debate with Lake \u201cwould only lead to constant interruptions, pointless distractions, and childish name-calling.\u201d Hobbs noted in an interview with CNN that Lake had repeatedly called for her arrest and said that her rhetoric had led to \u201cviolent threats and harassment against me.\u201d Lake, in turn, portrayed her opponent\u2019s answers as weakness, arguing that if Hobbs wouldn\u2019t agree to debate her, \u201cshe can\u2019t stand up against the cartels.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

            "article_content": "Herschel Walker\u2019s success in his upcoming runoff against incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock could depend on GOP luminaries flocking to Georgia between now and December 6, several Republicans say. Many are torn over whether that should include former President Donald Trump, whose status as the anchor of the party is under renewed scrutiny amid an underwhelming midterm outcome for Republicans. \u201cSince Tuesday night, the No. 1 question I\u2019ve been getting is, \u2018Is Trump going to screw this up?\u2019\u201d said Erick Erickson, a prominent Georgia-based conservative radio host who backed Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection bid. The latest on the 2022 midterm elections Though the former president helped recruit Walker, a Georgia football legend and longtime Trump family friend, into the Senate contest last year, he was ultimately advised to campaign elsewhere during the general election, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. Some Republicans are still haunted by Trump\u2019s appearances in Georgia leading up to a pair of 2021 runoffs that ended with Democrats winning both seats and gaining control of the Senate. At the time, then-President Trump littered his campaign speeches with false claims that voter fraud was rampant in Georgia and that Republican officials had worked against him. Walker allies feared that a Trump appearance ahead of the midterms would turn off independents and suburban women, critical voting blocs in the battleground state. Those concerns remain as Walker now enters the runoff period after neither he nor Warnock took more than 50% of the vote on Tuesday. Some Georgia Republicans said Trump\u2019s decision to proceed with an anticipated 2024 campaign launch next week will distract from what should be paramount for every Republican at the moment \u2013 helping the party secure a Senate majority. Trump aides sent out invitations late Thursday for a November 15 event  at Mar-a-Lago, which the former president hopes will blunt the momentum behind Ron DeSantis, the popular Florida governor and potential presidential primary rival who glided to reelection this week. In fact, while a debate unfolds over whether Trump should campaign for Walker in the coming days, several Republicans said they would eagerly welcome an appearance by DeSantis. \u201cWe need every Republican surrogate we can get into the state to put their arm around Herschel. I think that [Virginia Gov. Glenn] Youngkin or DeSantis is a better fit for soft Republicans or independents in the suburbs that we need to turn out,\u201d said Ralph Reed, president of the Faith & Freedom Coalition. Reed later noted that he believes Trump could also be helpful in driving turnout among rural Georgia voters, though he cautioned that he was \u201cnot speaking for the [Walker] campaign.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let them work that out,\u201d he said. Walker campaign manager Scott Paradise did not return a request for comment. A person close to the Walker campaign said DeSantis would be \u201ca huge draw if we could get him,\u201d noting that the Florida governor did not campaign for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp despite being just over the border and recently stumping for candidates in New York, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Kemp won his own reelection bid on Tuesday, defeating Democrat Stacey Abrams for the second time. And the Georgia governor has told allies he wants to help Walker any way he can, including by hitting the campaign trail for him, according to a person briefed on those conversations. \u201cDeSantis would be helpful. Youngkin would be helpful. Kemp will be helpful. I think those are the biggest draws in Georgia,\u201d said Erickson. A Republican with knowledge of DeSantis\u2019 political operation said DeSantis\u2019 interest in campaigning for Walker \u201cdepends on what happens with the remaining two races\u201d for Senate in Arizona and Nevada. Both contests remain too close to call but if Republicans win one of the races, control of the upper chamber will come down to Georgia. \u201cIt becomes the center of the political universe at that point,\u201d this person said. A spokesman for DeSantis did not respond to a request for comment about his future travel plans. Though DeSantis endorsed Republicans in tough battlegrounds and campaigned for controversial candidates like Arizona\u2019s Kari Lake and Pennsylvania\u2019s Doug Mastriano, he made no such effort during the midterms to aid Walker amid a flurry of headlines about the former Heisman Trophy winner\u2019s tumultuous past and personal troubles. DeSantis \u2013 whose Tallahassee executive residence is 20 miles from the Florida-Georgia border \u2013 also did not join the GOP fight in the Peach State two years ago for a pair of Senate runoffs Republicans ultimately lost. But a Republican fundraiser close to DeSantis said the Florida governor would likely make the trip across the border if he believes he can help Walker. \u201cHe\u2019s a Republican leader and wants Republicans to take the Senate,\u201d the fundraiser said. Momentum -- and planning -- for DeSantis 2024 bid takes off after resounding Florida win But if DeSantis shows up in Georgia, Trump allies said it would be exponentially harder to convince the former president to stay out of the state himself. Much to the frustration of those who want a distraction-free environment for Walker, Trump has continued to hurl insults at DeSantis in recent days, snapping at the Florida governor in a statement Thursday that referred to him as \u201can average Republican governor\u201d who lacked \u201cloyalty and class\u201d for refusing to rule out a White House bid of his own. If the Florida Republican goes to campaign for Walker, those attacks would likely intensify, said a person close to Trump. \u201cImagine [Trump] seeing Ron campaign for Herschel while he is being told, \u2018Please stay away.\u2019 He would go ballistic,\u201d this person said. One Trump aide, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said one idea being floated is to have the former president help Walker financially with a generous check. Trump\u2019s MAGA Inc. super PAC gave $16.4 million to candidates in the closing weeks of the 2022 cycle and he was sitting on more than $100 million across his fundraising committees at the end of September, according to federal election data. \u201cHe is looking at how he can salvage this moment and one of the ways for him to do that is to help Walker win,\u201d said a Trump adviser, referring to Tuesday\u2019s underwhelming outcome for Republicans and the stinging defeat of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, whom Trump had endorsed in the Republican Senate primary. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s no way he can announce a campaign for president and not go campaign for Walker,\u201d the person added, claiming that Trump\u2019s absence from Georgia as the presumptive frontrunner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination would suggest he is a liability for vulnerable Republicans \u2013 a toxic message to be sending at the outset of a presidential campaign. Michael Caputo, a 2016 Trump campaign aide who remains close to the former president, said Trump should do as much as possible to raise money for Walker because a presidential announcement will likely cause a surge in Democratic contributions to Warnock. \u201cYou have to offset that on the Walker side. From my perspective, the best thing Trump can do is donate and raise a ton of money for Herschel because he can,\u201d Caputo said. Trump\u2019s political team has held discussions about how he can best help Walker since it became clear the Georgia Senate race would advance to a runoff, according to two sources familiar, both of whom said nothing has been firmly decided. \u201cPresident Trump is 220-16 in races that have been called, and with the support of President Trump, Herschel Walker, after forcing a run-off, is well-positioned to win,\u201d Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said in a statement to CNN. Much of the sensitivity around a Trump visit to Georgia stems from his campaign appearances for former GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler two years ago, when both Republicans were fighting for survival in their own runoff contests. On the eve of those runoffs in 2021, Trump tore into statewide Republican officials for refusing to challenge the 2020 election results in Georgia, falsely claiming that he had won the state and promising to return when Kemp was up for reelection to campaign against the GOP incumbent, which Trump later fulfilled by recruiting Perdue to challenge Kemp in a primary. How Georgia's looming runoff election evokes America's segregationist history Republicans back in Washington watched the rally in horror at the time, deeply concerned that Trump\u2019s intense focus on election fraud and various attacks on statewide Republican officials would depress voter turnout among his core supporters the following day. In the end, both Loeffler and Perdue lost their runoffs, catapulting Warnock and Jon Ossof into the Senate and handing Democrats a narrow majority. The episode has come back to haunt Trump as Republicans face a potentially identical scenario to 2021, with control of the Senate riding on Georgia if Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly wins reelection in Arizona and Republican Adam Laxalt unseats incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada. Laxalt currently has a razor-thin lead while Kelly is more than 100,000 votes ahead of his Republican challenger, according to the vote counts as of Friday morning. Less concerned that he would deliver a message that depresses turnout, Republicans are primarily worried this time around that Trump would ultimately be a drag on Walker in a once deep-red state that is now trending purple and where the polarizing former president might alienate the exact voters Walker needs to prevail. \u201cHerschel needs to do better among Kemp voters and independents in the suburbs,\u201d said Reed. \u201cAbout 5% of the voters that went to Kemp didn\u2019t go to Herschel and he needs to get a minimum of 1 out of every 4 of them.\u201d",

            "article_content": "US democracy, which almost buckled two years ago, just delivered a perfect reflection of a polarized nation that mistrusts its leaders and isn\u2019t ready to unite on a new path. Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections gave Americans two more years to collectively decide what they really want by likely ushering in a divided government that is certain to be acrimonious but will prevent Democrats or Republicans from engineering a major ideological shift. It also scrambled the terrain of the early 2024 presidential race, with President Joe Biden and ex-President Donald Trump both moving toward new campaigns that much of the country appears not to want. The GOP appears to be crawling agonizingly slowly toward the 218 seats it needs to claim the speaker\u2019s gavel, signaling that voters may have ended Biden\u2019s big-spending progressive agenda. CNN has not projected control of the House or Senate, with the upper chamber hanging by a thread as races in two Democratic-held seats remain too early to call and a third advanced to a December runoff. But the election deprived the GOP of the massive red wave that it had predicted. A wafer-thin House Republican advantage would be volatile as extreme lawmakers would wield disproportionate power in the conference. A few defections by moderates could, meanwhile, end the party\u2019s capacity to pass bills. The latest on the 2022 midterm elections Divided government would also mean two years of dysfunction, bitterness, fiscal cliffs and debt showdowns between a Republican House and the Democratic White House. Token talk of bipartisan cooperation won\u2019t last long. Even if Democrats somehow manage to cling to the House as final results trickle in, they\u2019d also lack the leeway to pass nation-changing laws. And whoever wins the Senate majority, the chamber will effectively be split down the middle and locked in an angry stalemate. Like America itself. The election results pose new questions heading into the next White House campaign over the prospects of both Trump and Biden. Trump\u2019s obsession with promoting chaos candidates in his image may yet again doom Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s chances of returning as majority leader. Trump, of course, is already blaming everyone but himself as he eyes a campaign launch next week that will lack the springboard of a Republican landslide he would have claimed was all his doing. And the roaring reelection of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis presented Trump with a huge potential 2024 GOP primary headache. Biden, meanwhile, seemed unusually upbeat for a president who may soon face a tsunami of subpoenas, investigations and even possible impeachment from a GOP House. He enjoyed calling out the conventional wisdom during a White House news conference on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWhile the press and the pundits were predicting a giant red wave, it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. When Biden meets world leaders in the coming days in Egypt and Bali, Indonesia, he can crow about escaping the epic first-term shellacking suffered by most presidents. He also put off an immediate inquest about his suitability to carry the Democratic banner into 2024, ahead of a vacation he said he\u2019d like to take between Thanksgiving and Christmas with First Lady Jill Biden to consider his future. Yet a loss is a loss. And CNN exit polls show only 30% of House race voters want a president with a low-40s approval rating, who will be 80 in a few weeks, to run for reelection in a campaign that could well coincide with the recession many economists fear. Biden would prefer another finding from those same polls, however, that showed Trump \u2013 with a 39% approval rating \u2013 is even less popular. To strategize for the two years ahead, both parties must come to an understanding of what exactly happened during a highly unusual midterm election shaped by a once-in-a-century pandemic and the aftermath of an unprecedented attempt to steal power by a defeated president in 2020. Biden won two years ago partly on a platform of restoring normality, which he\u2019s been unable to fully deliver despite high job growth and millions of Covid-19 inoculations. One way to look at Tuesday\u2019s results is that voters still want the same thing and are gravitating to leaders who seem relatively moderate in relation to their parties\u2019 extremes and are competent, good managers. Republican governors like Brian Kemp of Georgia and John Sununu of New Hampshire and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin ran ahead of more radical Senate nominees in their own parties. Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the House and Senate still up in the air While Trump still wields huge power in the Republican grassroots, an endorsement from the ultimate avatar of chaos is not necessarily the way to woo a broader general electorate. This may bode ill for an ex-president planning to run again on the false premise that his second term was stolen. It was noticeable how Trump\u2019s speeches in recent days, ostensibly in support of GOP nominees, were, as always, mostly about himself. While some base GOP voters love the show, the ex-president rarely seems to address a forward-looking program for a new term. One reason why Tuesday\u2019s results were inconclusive is that neither side produced a midterm message sufficiently compelling to dominate this election and to win over voters who were not already locked into their partisan bunkers. \u201cIt is going to be stasis for two years until this question is called again,\u201d said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University. \u201cThat seems to be what the outcome was \u2013 it was a non-outcome outcome. Maybe that\u2019s not the worst thing in the world because I think we do need a presidential election year in which to try to establish some kind of direction on this.\u201d This period of suspended, if embittered, political animation presents each party with an opportunity. The deficit for Democrats is not so large that it would be impossible for the party to sweep back to a monopoly on power in 2024. The GOP could still establish a platform for a definitive win in the same election with workable congressional majorities and a presidential candidate who can capture appeal outside the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d world. But both parties need to listen to what voters really want \u2013 a possibly forlorn hope. The midterm campaign was notable for how neither Republicans nor Democrats fully embraced the frustrations of the electorate. Democrats seemed to downplay angst over inflation and ignored concerns over crime and the border. Many Republicans obsessed over vote fraud falsehoods, buttering up Trump and laying plans to investigate Biden with power they didn\u2019t yet have. On either side, the time appears ripe for new voices and fresh visions that could lead a political realignment. Yet the most likely outcome seems a repeat clash between the soon-to-be 80-something and the 70-something who contested the last election. Amid the now familiar ritual of election night bleeding over into election week, Biden and Trump agreed on one thing on Wednesday: nothing needs to change based on the rebuke that they both received from voters. Asked what he needs to do differently, the president replied: \u201cNothing. Because (voters are) just finding out what we\u2019re doing. The more they know about what we\u2019re doing the more support there is.\u201d Biden had a point given that the benefits of his big legislative wins, including a health care and climate bill and a jobs-creating infrastructure law, will take months and years to play out. But that won\u2019t help voters struggling with 40-year-high inflation and high gasoline prices now. The president also spent time lauding the miracle of democracy that saw millions of Americans peacefully cast votes. And he spoke to the possible next Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who took time out from his attempts to shore up support in his far-smaller-than-expected potential majority to have a call with the president. Trump grapples with 2024 questions amid GOP midterm letdown But Biden also staked out non-negotiable areas, like efforts to combat global warming and protecting Medicare and Social Security, that will potentially forestall any meaningful bipartisan initiatives with a Republican House likely to be fixated on roughing him up ahead of a possible 2024 race. The president said Wednesday that \u201cI don\u2019t feel any hurry\u201d on the question of whether to run again \u2013 and Tuesday\u2019s better-than-expected Democratic showing in the House eased the pressure for now. But if Biden cannot use what could be a chaotic GOP House as a foil, the questions about his 2024 prospects could return. An early announcement by Trump, however, would allow the president to once again carve out the contrast that paved his way to the White House two years ago. Trump left an election night party he hosted at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday in a sour mood as several candidates he promoted like Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania fizzled, leaving him open to blame, sources told CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr and Kristen Holmes. The red wave he expected to ride into a presidential campaign launch next week failed to materialize. Worse, the strength of the DeSantis victory in Florida \u2013 which suggested the one-time Trump prot\u00e9g\u00e9 had found a way to build a new GOP majority \u2013 raises the prospect that the former president will not be able to coast to the GOP nomination as he hoped. Senate control could hinge on two states with prominent election deniers One possible effect of DeSantis\u2019 resounding reelection win could be to scare off other potential Republican hopefuls. Trump was able to prevail in 2016, in part, because opposition to him was filtered through a crowded GOP field in a primary system in which most states award delegates on a winner-take-all basis. But a smaller pack in 2024 could enable one candidate \u2013 perhaps DeSantis \u2013 to consolidate anti-Trump votes among GOP activists who prize the populist, nationalist appeal of Trumpism but may begin to view the former president\u2019s character and antics as a general election liability. Trump, however, insisted Wednesday that the outcome of the midterms was irrelevant to his plans for 2024 as he touted wins by Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, whom he had supported. \u201cWhy would anything change?\u201d the ex-president told Fox News Digital. He may be right. A Republican Party that has been simultaneously bullied and charmed by the 45th president ever since he launched his first campaign in 2015 has never found the will or the rationale to move on \u2013 even after an unprecedented insurrection against the citadel of US democracy at the Capitol in January 2021. While ditching the twice-impeached Trump could be the logical choice for a party desperate to win back the presidency in two years, the infatuation with the former real estate magnate and reality show star has always been an emotional reflex at the grassroots. There is no sign thus far in the wake of the midterm elections that has changed.",

            "article_content": "Republicans had hoped to make big enough gains among Latino voters in 2022, extending their inroads from two years ago, that would fundamentally realign the political landscape in several battleground states \u2013 and the presidential map \u2013 in their favor. But although Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis delivered on those hopes, winning heavily Latino counties that no Republican candidate for governor or president had won in a generation, other Republicans could not keep up with his pace. Even with many races still to be called, exit polls and results in some key House races showed the party improving on the margins, but not making the leap among Latino voters GOP strategists had sought. The outcomes of House races still unfolding in California and New York, as well as Senate and governor\u2019s races in Arizona and Nevada, will play a key role in determining the significance of this year\u2019s smaller shifts toward the GOP. Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the House and Senate still up in the air Democrats won two of three South Texas congressional races, all in the Rio Grande Valley, that were widely seen as a gauge of whether the GOP could build on former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 gains in a historically Democratic area. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the most conservative Democrat in the House, posted a double-digit victory in the 28th District, which stretches from San Antonio to his hometown of Laredo. And in the 34th District, in the state\u2019s southeastern tip \u2013 another border district that includes McAllen, Harlingen and Brownsville \u2013 Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who was running in a new district, delivered a clear victory over Republican Rep. Mayra Flores, who won a special election this year under the old district lines. \u201cThe RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,\u201d Flores tweeted in the early Wednesday morning hours. The only GOP victory in the region came from Monica De La Cruz, who won in the neighboring 15th District, which was drawn in last year\u2019s redistricting process to be a GOP-leaning but competitive seat. Democrats saw their victories in the region, after a deluge of Republican spending on the three races, as a sign the party had held off the GOP in the largely Hispanic Rio Grande Valley after 2020. \u201cEven with these large investments, we showed the Republican party that South Texas is not their home,\u201d Gonzalez said at his victory party, the Texas Tribune reported. Latinos are not a monolith, and South Texas \u2013 like Florida \u2013 isn\u2019t a perfect window into the broader Latino population. Voters there are typically more culturally conservative \u2013 a reality that explains Cuellar\u2019s survival despite two hard-fought primaries against a progressive challenger and a tough general election while under the cloud of an FBI investigation. (In April, Cuellar\u2019s lawyer said federal authorities told him that his client was not a target of the investigation.) Exit polls: High inflation dominates voters' views in the midterm elections Nationwide, Democrats won Latino voters \u2013 60% to the GOP\u2019s 39% \u2013 according to exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. That\u2019s a slight improvement for Republicans over 2020. Democrats\u2019 strongest performance was among younger Latinos and women, while Republicans did better with men and older voters. The exit polls showed Democrats dominating among the 75% of Latino voters who said abortion should be legal, winning that group by 58 percentage points. The party also avoided massive blame for an economy that 69% of Latinos said is fair or poor, winning those voters by 12 percentage points. But the most important question about long-term trends about Latino voters is whether a marginal shift in the GOP\u2019s favor this year will be significant enough to change the political landscapes of presidential swing states such as Arizona and Nevada, which, like Texas, have big Latino populations, largely of Mexican descent. That question can\u2019t be answered yet: Both states are still counting votes in hard-fought races for governor and the Senate. The biggest reason for Republicans to celebrate \u2013 and perhaps one of the most important outcomes of this year\u2019s midterm elections \u2013 might be DeSantis, widely viewed as a potential 2024 presidential contender, delivering such a dominant victory in Florida that Democrats were openly suggesting that the state is now effectively off the list of presidential battlegrounds. The most eye-popping outcome in his blowout victory over Democrat Charlie Crist \u2013 and one that demonstrated the breadth of DeSantis\u2019 appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters \u2013 came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic, particularly of Cuban heritage, and historically a huge source of Democratic votes. Republicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor\u2019s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn\u2019t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002. The political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes the county\u2019s outcome an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance in the state. There were other important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Katie Hobbs is leading Republican Kari Lake in Arizona governor\u2019s race with a little more than half of precincts reporting, and though much could change as ballots are counted, the GOP nominee is already casting doubt about the election results. Lake won the GOP primary after amplifying former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 presidential election, falsely insisting that the election was rigged and stolen. And though the current margins could change dramatically as votes are counted, Lake is suggesting without any evidence that there could be problems with Tuesday\u2019s results. (Hobbs, as secretary of state, rebuffed GOP efforts to overturn the results in the 2020 election). In a speech Tuesday night at her election night headquarters, Lake said she felt like it is \u201cgroundhog day.\u201d Five baseless 2022 election conspiracy theories, fact-checked \u201cWe had November 3, 2020, that was called incompetency 101,\u201d Lake said. She went on to suggest there was \u201cincompetency\u201d at play in both the August primary and in Tuesday\u2019s election \u2013 a not-so-subtle critique of her opponent\u2019s oversight over elections. It was not immediately clear what she was referring to, but there has been no evidence of any widespread fraud. \u201cWe need honest elections and we\u2019re going to bring them to you, Arizona, I assure you of that. The system we have right now does not work,\u201d Lake said. She later told her supporters to be patient and said she was confident that she would win. Hobbs also addressed her backers on Tuesday night, stating that the campaign was feeling good about what they were seeing. \u201cI know we\u2019re all eager to find out who won each of these incredibly important races, but we will need to be patient and wait for every vote to be counted,\u201d she said in remarks as prepared for delivery. \u201cWe know my opponent and her allies have been sowing doubt and confusion throughout this campaign, and it\u2019s unacceptable that they were spreading misinformation today while people were exercising their right to vote.\u201d Voting goes mostly smoothly on Election Day as baseless fraud claims swirl All four GOP nominees at the top of the ticket in Arizona have echoed Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. And right-wing media seized on tabulator problems in Maricopa County earlier on Tuesday to raise the idea of fraud \u2013 despite assurances to the contrary from county officials \u2013 in a clear echo of some conservatives\u2019 repeated attempts to cast doubt on Maricopa\u2019s results in 2020. Arizona is a key battleground this year for governor and Senate and likely will be again for president in 2024, sparking warnings from leading Democratic figures, including former President Barack Obama, that the GOP\u2019s embrace of Trump\u2019s election falsehoods and conspiracy theories could put democracy at risk if they were to sweep to power. Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of right-wing group Turning Point USA, tweeted a false claim about two-hour wait times in Maricopa County, which was the site of repeated partisan \u201caudits\u201d in 2020. A Maricopa County judge on Tuesday night denied a bid by Republicans to extend polling hours by three hours, saying there was no evidence that any voters were precluded from exercising their right to vote. Interactive: Arizona, one of six states to watch for the 2022 midterms Lake has repeatedly said she would not have certified Joe Biden\u2019s win in Arizona in 2020. The former news anchor at Fox 10 in Phoenix ascended quickly to become one of the most prominent candidates in the 2022 cycle as she and Hobbs vied to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. Lake hewed closely to the Trump playbook on more than just the 2020 election. She promised to declare an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the border \u2013 in what she described as an effort to amass greater power for the governor\u2019s office to address the migrant crisis \u2013 and she called for the arrest of both of Dr. Anthony Fauci and her Democratic opponent. Before announcing her bid, Lake left her anchor job in 2021 \u2013 stating that she didn\u2019t like the direction that journalism was going \u2013 after becoming a household name in Phoenix. In one of her campaign videos, she said she was taking a sledgehammer to \u201cleftist lies and propaganda,\u201d as she destroyed television sets with the tool in stiletto boots. She dispatched her primary opponents with her forceful denunciations of Democratic leaders\u2019 handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 blasting restrictions like masking as unnecessary and harmful to children. She welcomed comparisons to Trump all the way through the end of the campaign \u2013 professing at one event that she was delighted when one admirer called her \u201cTrump in a dress.\u201d Hobbs, a former social worker who worked with victims of domestic violence before becoming a state lawmaker, ran a far more low-key and understated campaign, limiting her access to reporters and holding small, intimate events with supporters. She made democracy and abortion rights her central focus, portraying Lake as an \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d figure who could jeopardize the sanctity of the 2024 presidential election by refusing to certify the results.",

            "article_content": "A dispirited nation worn down by crises and economic anxieties votes Tuesday in an election that is more likely to cement its divides than promote unity. Elections are often cleansing moments setting the country on a fresh path powered by people freely choosing their leaders \u2013 and those leaders accepting the results. But the final hours of this midterm campaign laid bare the polarized electoral environment, the specter of political violence and the possibility of disputed races \u2013 all of which have raised the stakes of the first nationwide vote since former President Donald Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election and have augured an acrimonious two years to come. Interactive: Six states to watch for the 2022 midterms Republicans predict they will win the House of Representatives on Tuesday \u2013 a victory that, if it materializes, would give them the power to throttle President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic agenda and clamp an investigative vise on his White House. The Senate is, meanwhile, on a knife edge with a handful of races in states like Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania likely to decide who wins the majority. Above all, the midterm campaign turned on the cost of living crisis, with polls showing the economy by far the most important issue for voters, who are still waiting for the restoration of normality after a once-in-a-century pandemic that Biden had promised in 2020. A gusher of news on job losses just before polls opened, including in the tech industry, worsened jitters about a slowdown that could destroy one of the bright spots of the Biden economy \u2013 historically low unemployment. Americans are already struggling with higher prices for food and gasoline and now must cope with the Federal Reserve hikes in interest rates that not only make credit card debt, buying a home and rent more expensive, but could tip the economy into a recession. The economic situation threatens to set up a classic midterm election rebuke for a first-term president \u2013 and in some ways, this would be a sign that democracy is working. Elections have for generations been a safety valve for the public to express dissent with the country\u2019s direction. If they lose on Tuesday, Democrats will have to accept the result, regroup and try again in two years to convince the nation that their policies will chart the way out of crises. And Republicans, if they take majorities in Congress, will be able to argue voters have given them a mandate to fix things where Biden has failed. But after repeated elections in which disgruntled voters have punished the party with the most power, the GOP could find its own performance on the ballot in two years. Why 2022 may bring a new peak of political instability While that continuum is the essence of democracy, the run-up to these midterms has also highlighted the depth of the nation\u2019s self-estrangement in a political era in which both sides seem to think victory for the other is tantamount to losing their country. In recent days, it\u2019s been impossible to ignore the reality of a weakened presidency, a viciousness in political debate and the threat to free and fair elections posed by scores of Republican candidates running on a platform of Trump\u2019s 2020 election lies. Tuesday looks set to be a tough day for Biden. The president did not spend the final hours of the campaign battling to get vulnerable Democrats over the line in a critical swing state. Instead, he was in the liberal bastion of Maryland \u2013 a safe haven where his low approval ratings likely won\u2019t hurt Democrats running for office. While he did stump for Pennsylvania Senate nominee John Fetterman over the weekend, the venue of his final event encapsulated his drained political juice as he contemplates a 2024 reelection campaign. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cI think we\u2019ll win the Senate and I think the House is tougher,\u201d he said, admitting life would become \u201cmore difficult\u201d for him if the GOP takes control of Congress. 'I never thought it would be Paul': Nancy Pelosi reveals how she first heard her husband had been attacked On the eve of an election in which he is not on the ballot, Trump made it all about himself \u2013 even as he claimed he didn\u2019t want to overshadow Republican candidates. At a rally ostensibly for GOP Senate nominee J.D. Vance in Ohio, Trump unleashed a dystopian, self-indulgent dirge of a speech laced with demagoguery, exaggerated claims that America was in terminal decline, and outright falsehoods about the 2020 election. And he laid the groundwork to proclaim he is the victim of totalitarian state-style persecution if he is indicted in several criminal probes into his conduct. Trump also vowed to make \u201ca very big announcement\u201d at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on November 15, which appears to be the worst kept secret in politics \u2013 that he will seek another term in the White House. The fact that a twice-impeached president, who left office in disgrace after legitimizing violence as a form of political expression, has a good chance of winning underscores the turbulence of our time. The false reality that Trump spun over his baseless claims about a stolen election and the scores of election deniers carrying the Republican flag only validated Biden\u2019s warnings in the midterm campaign that democracy is on the ballot \u2013 even if most voters appear more concerned with the high cost of feeding their families than the somewhat esoteric debates about the state of the nation\u2019s founding values. The shadow of violence that has hung over American policies since Trump incited the Capitol insurrection was exacerbated as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recalled the moment of trauma when she was told by police that her husband Paul had been attacked with a hammer. In an exclusive interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, she also condemned certain Republicans for joking about it. \u201cIn our democracy, there is one party that is doubting the outcome of the election, feeding that flame, and mocking any violence that happens. That has to stop,\u201d Pelosi said. Trump only added to that political fury when he referred to Pelosi as \u201can animal\u201d in his rally in Ohio. Exclusive: Kevin McCarthy previews Republicans' plans for the majority -- starting at the border House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who is the likely next speaker if Republicans net the five seats they need for the House majority, blamed Democrats for heated political rhetoric as he laid out an aggressive agenda, targeting border security and relentless investigations in an exclusive interview with CNN. He did not rule out impeaching Biden, a step radical members of his conference are already demanding. \u201cWe will never use impeachment for political purposes,\u201d McCarthy told CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona. \u201cThat  doesn\u2019t mean if something rises to the occasion, it would not be used at any other time.\u201d And Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who says he\u2019s in line to be chairman of the permanent subcommittee on investigations if he wins reelection and Republicans take the Senate, said he\u2019d use the power granted him, in what is likely to be a very narrowly decided election, to further crank up the partisan heat in Washington. \u201cI would be like a mosquito in a nudist colony. It would be a target-rich environment,\u201d Johnson said. There\u2019s something magical about democratic elections, when differences are exposed in debates and fierce campaigns. But there\u2019s mostly, until now, been an expectation that both sides would then abide by the verdict of the people. That can no longer be taken for granted and there\u2019s a sense of foreboding that is hanging over voting on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are increasingly bullish on winning big in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, as they slam Democrats over raging inflation and crime while President Joe Biden seeks a late reprieve by warning that GOP election deniers could destroy democracy. The GOP has considerable momentum in its bid to win back the House of Representatives while the destiny of the Democratic-run Senate will come down to a handful of knife-edge races. A Republican triumph in either chamber would severely curtail Biden\u2019s domestic presidency and set up an acrimonious two years of political standoffs ahead of the 2024 White House race. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the potential next Republican House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, laid out his plans for power and vowed to tackle inflation, border security and rising crime. He promised broad investigations against the Biden administration on the Afghanistan withdrawal, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and how the administration has dealt with parents and school board meetings. And he didn\u2019t rule out an eventual push to impeach Biden. \u201cThe first thing you\u2019ll see is a bill to control the border first,\u201d McCarthy told CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona. In a sign of the critical stakes and the growing angst among Democrats, four presidents \u2013 Biden, Donald Trump, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton \u2013 all took to the campaign trail over the weekend. Ex-President Trump, edging ever closer to announcing a 2024 White House bid, will wrap up a campaign he used to show his enduring magnetism among grassroots Republicans, in Ohio, with a rally for Senate nominee J.D. Vance on Monday. In a speech that concluded in pouring rain for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on Sunday, Trump predicted voters would \u201celect an incredible slate of true MAGA warriors to Congress.\u201d Biden and Trump converge in Pennsylvania in possible 2024 preview Biden, who spent Saturday getting out the vote in the critical Pennsylvania Senate race with Obama, warned that the nation\u2019s core values are in peril from Republicans who denied the truth about the US Capitol insurrection and following the brutal attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband Paul. \u201cDemocracy is literally on the ballot. This is a defining moment for the nation. And we all must speak with one voice regardless of our party. There\u2019s no place in America for political violence,\u201d Biden said. The president will end his effort to stave off a rebuke from voters at a Democratic event in Maryland. The fact that he will be in a liberal bastion and not trying to boost an endangered lawmaker in a key race on the final night reflects his compromised standing in an election that has reverted to a referendum on his tattered credibility and low approval ratings. Democrats are playing defense in blue-state strongholds like New York, Washington and Oregon and are waging a longshot struggle to cling to the House of Representatives. Republicans only need a net gain of five seats to win back control. A handful of swing state showdowns will decide the destiny of the Senate, currently split 50-50, including in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Republicans are also showing renewed interest in the race in New Hampshire between Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, a pro-Trump candidate Democrats brand as an election-denying extremist.   Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel predicted on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that her party would win both the House and the Senate and accused Biden of being oblivious to the economic anxiety among Americans with his repeated warnings about democracy. \u201cHere\u2019s where the Democrats are: they\u2019re inflation deniers, they are crime deniers, they\u2019re education deniers,\u201d McDaniel said. Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who heads the GOP Senate campaign committee, predicted his party would surge to a majority on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get 52-plus,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday referring to the tally of seats he was expecting to control. But the president warned in a speech in Pittsburgh on Saturday night alongside Obama that Republican concern over the economy was a ruse and claimed that the GOP would cut Social Security and Medicare if they won majorities. How to tell if the GOP is heading for a landslide in the House \u201cLook, they\u2019re all about the wealthier getting wealthy. And the wealthier staying wealthy. The middle class gets stiffed. The poor get poorer under their policy,\u201d Biden said. The midterms are the first national vote since the chaos and violence triggered by Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the result of the last presidential election and there are already fears that some Republican candidates may follow his example and try to defy the will of voters if they don\u2019t win. Some, like Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, have already raised concerns about the integrity of the vote. In another development on Sunday, a staffer at the headquarters of Kari Lake, the pro-Trump nominee in the Arizona gubernatorial contest, opened a letter containing suspicious white powder. Lake\u2019s opponent, current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, condemned the incident as \u201cincredibly concerning.\u201d On a frenetic final weekend of campaigning, Biden and Obama tried to push Democratic nominee John Fetterman over the line in a Pennsylvania Senate race that represents the party\u2019s best chance to pick up a GOP-held Senate seat. But Democrats are under fierce pressure in states like Arizona and Nevada that could flip the chamber to the GOP. Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to win the majority. The first major clashes of the 2024 GOP nominating contest, meanwhile, broke out in Florida with Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holding dueling rallies Sunday night. The ex-president, who is expected to launch a third White House bid within days, coined a new nickname Saturday for the man who could prove to be his toughest primary opponent: \u201cRon DeSanctimonious.\u201d But the Florida governor chose not to engage, turning his ire instead on Biden and calling his Democratic opponent, Charlie Crist, \u201ca donkey\u201d while taking credit for defying Washington officials and experts during the pandemic. With competing Florida rallies Sunday, Trump and DeSantis preview a potential GOP presidential primary showdown \u201cI was willing to stand out there and take the arrows so that you didn\u2019t have to,\u201d DeSantis said. As he rallied for Rubio, who is seeking reelection, Trump didn\u2019t repeat his mockery of DeSantis on Sunday but again teased the likelihood of a presidential run. In another sign the next presidential race is stirring, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, who has long eyed higher office, announced he would not join the Republican primary. Former President Bill Clinton was also called into action on Saturday, stumping for New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in Brooklyn. The Empire state should be safe territory for his party but Hochul\u2019s closer-than-expected reelection race against Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin underscores the toughness of the national environment for Democrats. \u201cI know the average election rally is just \u2018whoop dee doo do vote for me,\u2019 but your life is on the line. For young people in the audience, your life is on the line,\u201d Clinton said. With Americans struggling under the high cost of living, Democrats have failed to head off a referendum on Biden\u2019s economic management and presidency with most polls predicting building Republican momentum that could deal the first-term president a classic midterm election rebuke. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 There is growing second guessing over Democrats\u2019 strategy and whether they are talking effectively about the issues voters care about most. Biden\u2019s closing message on saving democracy from pro-Trump candidates might be an accurate reflection of fresh threats posed by the ex-president and his acolytes. But it does nothing to ease fears about the cost of groceries or a gallon of gas. Biden, however, has not managed to speak effectively and personally to Americans craving a return to normality after the pandemic or to get across that he fully understands the pain of rising prices in a 40-year-high inflation explosion that his White House once repeatedly branded \u201ctransitory.\u201d If Republicans win back the House, they can impose a vise on Biden\u2019s legislative program and set up a series of perilous political showdowns on spending and raising the debt-ceiling. They are promising a relentless round of investigations and hearings into everything from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the surge in migrants across the southern border to Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. A GOP majority would contain scores of candidates in Trump\u2019s extreme image and would be weaponized to damage the president as much as possible ahead of a potential rematch with Trump in 2024. And a Republican Senate would frustrate Biden\u2019s hopes of balancing out the judiciary after four years of Trump nominating conservative judges.",

            "article_content": "All year, the principal question looming over the 2022 campaign has been whether Democrats could defy political gravity. As we\u2019re nearing the end, the answer appears to be: no, or at least not entirely. Midterm elections have almost always been bad for the party holding the White House, and they have been especially bad when most Americans are dissatisfied with the economy and the president\u2019s performance. Those conditions are present in force now, with polls showing that most Americans disapprove of how President Joe Biden has handled crime, the border, and especially the economy and inflation. Pessimism about the economy is pervasive. Historically such attitudes have generated big gains up and down the ballot for the party out of the White House \u2013 in this case, the Republicans. That may be how the election ultimately turns out, especially in House and state legislative races where the individual candidates are less well-known, and many voters are likely to express dissatisfaction with the country\u2019s direction by voting against the party in power. The president\u2019s party, in fact, has lost House seats in all but three midterm elections since the Civil War. If there is a surprise in the House, it\u2019s less likely to come from Democrats maintaining their majority than the Republicans exceeding the average 26 seat midterm gain for the party out of power since World War II. But Democrats have remained unexpectedly competitive in the higher-profile Senate and gubernatorial races by focusing attention not only on what Biden has done, but what Republicans might do, with power. Many of these statewide contests have become a \u201cdouble negative election\u201d: while most voters in the key states consistently say they disapprove of Biden\u2019s job performance, most also say they hold negative personal views about the GOP candidates, many of whom were propelled to their nomination by support from Donald Trump. If Democrats hold the Senate, or hold their own in the top governor races, a principal reason will be the large number of voters who viewed GOP nominees as unqualified, extreme (particularly in their desire to ban or restrict abortion), a threat to democracy, or all of the above. The same dynamic could also save some House Democrats in districts where Biden has fallen well below majority support. So many races are so close \u2013 within the margin of error in public polls \u2013 that the results Tuesday could range from a true red wave to a Democratic sigh of relief. The scary precedent for Democrats is that in wave years almost all of the close races often tip in the same direction \u2013 toward the party out of power. A reason for Democratic hope is that in the final surveys, their candidates are consistently running better among all registered voters than among those the pollsters consider most \u201clikely\u201d to vote. That means the party could outperform expectations if even slightly more of its key constituencies (particularly young people) show up than pollsters anticipate \u2013 an outcome that groups such as the powerful union Unite Here is trying to achieve with 1,000 canvassers knocking on doors each day in Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. \u201cWe are in the battle every place,\u201d says Gwen Mills, the union\u2019s secretary-treasurer. \u201cAll of [these races] are within the margin of effort.\u201d If Republicans take back either chamber this week, it would mark the fifth consecutive election in which a president who went into a midterm with unified control of government had it revoked by the voters. That happened to Donald Trump in 2018, Barack Obama in 2010, George W. Bush in 2006 and Bill Clinton in 1994. No president, in fact, has successfully defended unified control of Congress through a mid-term since Jimmy Carter in 1978 \u2013 and he was insulated by the huge Congressional margins Democrats had amassed after Watergate, as well as his party\u2019s strength in what was then still a \u201csolid South\u201d for Democrats. (The sole asterisk on this pattern is that Republicans under George W. Bush regained unified control of Congress in the 2002 midterm held a year after the September 11 attacks  after a party switch by a Republican senator in early 2001 flipped control of the chamber to Democrats and broke the GOP\u2019s unified hold on Congress.) A Republican takeover of either or both chambers would extend one of the defining trends of modern politics: Neither party has held the White House and Congress for more than four consecutive years since 1968. That\u2019s a stark departure from most of the 20th century when each side, at different times, cemented lasting control for as long as 14 consecutive years. No matter what happens Tuesday, most experts don\u2019t anticipate either party shattering this fragile modern stand-off to establish a lasting edge. \u201cI don\u2019t see either side getting a durable advantage,\u201d says Gary Jacobson, a professor of political science emeritus at the University of California at San Diego. \u201cThey are highly polarized parties, and they are very closely balanced overall.\u201d From that angle, Republican gains Tuesday would simply continue a long-standing tendency toward instability in our political system, with the initiative rapidly shifting back and forth between the parties. But the election could also ratchet that instability to a combustible new level. The strong tide behind Republicans virtually guarantees victories for some, maybe many, of the hundreds of candidates who have embraced Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 elections and signaled that they will seek to tilt the electoral rules toward the GOP or simply deny future wins by Democrats. Some of those candidates, if they lose this week, seem likely to emulate Trump after 2020 and refuse to concede, claiming fraud. (Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have each suggested as much already.) The most important legacy of this week\u2019s voting may be the beachhead inside the electoral system it will likely establish for Republican officeholders untethered to America\u2019s democratic traditions as we have known them. In more conventional political calculations, Tuesday\u2019s results seem likely to resurface debates, that had somewhat receded during the Trump years, over the structural electoral challenges Democrats face in the battle to control Congress. The modern period of Congressional elections arguably began in 1994, when Republicans captured both the House and Senate in the backlash against Bill Clinton\u2019s chaotic first two years. That ended an era in which Democrats had held the House majority for 40 consecutive years, and controlled the Senate, usually by wide margins, for all but six years over that long span. Since 1994, though, Republicans have controlled Congress more often than Democrats. The GOP has held the Senate for about 16 and a half years (counting the roughly half year before the party switch cost them their majority in 2001) and Democrats for only about 11 and a half years. The imbalance in the House has been even more lopsided: Republicans have held it for 20 of these past 28 years, and Democrats for just eight. Especially ominous for Democrats is that if they lose the House on Tuesday, it would mark the second consecutive time they have surrendered their majority only four years after regaining it. (The previous case came when they were swept from the majority by the Tea Party uprising in 2010, just four years after they recaptured the chamber in 2006.) By contrast, Republicans held the House for 12 consecutive years from 1994 through 2006, and then for eight from 2010 through 2018. What makes this disparity especially striking is that it has come even as Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections since 1992 \u2013 something no party has done since the formation of the two-party system in 1828. (No Republican candidate has reached even 51% of the presidential popular vote since 1988.) These results clearly suggest the modern Democratic electoral coalition, on a nationwide basis, is larger than the Republican coalition. And yet, Republicans, more often than not, have controlled the Congressional majorities in this era anyway. Aggressive GOP gerrymanders partly explain that difference in the House. But that doesn\u2019t fully explain the GOP\u2019s House advantage and it isn\u2019t a factor at all in the party\u2019s Senate edge. Instead, the Republican Congressional success largely reflects geographic and demographic limitations of the Democratic coalition that almost certainly will be evident again this week. Tuesday\u2019s election is likely to remind Democrats again that they are competing in too few places to establish a durable majority in Congress. In the House, Republicans have established such an overwhelming hold on rural and exurban districts that Democrats must win a very high share of urban and suburban districts to reach a majority. In a good year, like 2018, Democrats can meet that test. And even now, the continued resistance of college-educated suburban voters to the Trump-era Republican Party has provided Democrats a chance to hold down their losses in white-collar districts. But ceding so many rural, exurban and small-town seats leaves Democrats too little cushion to lose some of their suburban seats \u2013 as they inevitably will when discontent over the economy, and secondarily crime, is this high even in those places. If anything, the Democrats\u2019 geographic challenge is even greater in the Senate. A dominant trend in modern US politics is that both parties are winning virtually all the Senate seats in states that typically support their presidential candidates. The challenge for Democrats is that, despite their repeated victories in the popular vote, slightly more states reliably lean Republican than Democrat in presidential races. Democrats already hold 39 of the 40 Senate seats in the 20 states that voted against Donald Trump both times (Susan Collins in Maine is the only exception). But 25 states voted for Trump both times, and they provide Republicans an even larger Senate contingent, with the GOP holding 47 of their 50 seats. Democrats have squeezed out their precarious 50-50 Senate majority only by capturing eight of the ten seats in the five states that flipped from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020 (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia). This geography is what makes this week\u2019s Senate elections so crucial to Democrats. This year\u2019s key races are occurring almost entirely in states that Biden won, albeit mostly narrowly, with Democrats defending seats in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, Colorado and Washington, and targeting Republican-held seats in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (With longer odds, Democrats have also mounted serious challenges to Republicans in Ohio and North Carolina, two states that twice voted for Trump.) Given that map, Democratic strategists recognize it\u2019s critical for the party to expand, or at least maintain, its Senate margin now. After this year, the Senate terrain will rapidly become more foreboding for Democrats. In 2024, they will be defending all three of the seats they hold in the two-time Trump states (Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana), as well as seats in half a dozen other swing states that could go either way in a presidential contest (including Arizona, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.) If most of the toss up Senate races fall to the Republicans on Tuesday, those gains, combined with the 2024 map, could put the GOP in position to dominate the upper chamber throughout this decade. \u201cIf Republicans take the Senate, I don\u2019t see in our immediate lifetime how Democrats are going to take back\u201d the majority, says Doug Sosnik, a senior White House political adviser to Bill Clinton. Much of the Democrats\u2019 Senate problem is rooted in the constitutional provision that provides two Senate seats to every state. That magnifies the influence of sparsely populated, rural and strongly Republican interior states. There\u2019s no political repositioning that is likely to provide Democrats a realistic chance any time soon to win Senate seats in Wyoming and Idaho or North and South Dakota. But many Democratic strategists argue that the party must expand its map in the Senate by finding ways to attract more non-college and non-urban voters, especially with white people, but across racial lines, in at least a few more states. That list of potential targets includes places like Ohio, Iowa and Florida where Democrats competed much more effectively as recently as under President Barack Obama. Rebuilding the party\u2019s competitiveness in those states could take years and likely require a significant change in its positioning and message. Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the centrist Democratic group Third Way, points out that while the party\u2019s modern coalition of young people, racial minorities and college-educated whites has allowed it to effectively contest the presidency, it doesn\u2019t represent a winning majority in enough states to reliably hold the Senate. \u201cWhen you look at the electoral college, college educated [and diverse] America is close to enough to elect you president,\u201d Kessler says. \u201cBut it is not close to getting you a majority in the Senate.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s election could also demonstrate the reemergence of a second demographic challenge for Democrats in the battle for Congress, what analysts in the past have called the \u201cboom and bust\u201d nature of their electoral coalition. The biggest remaining uncertainty for Tuesday\u2019s election may be how many young people, who polls show continue to back Democrats in large proportions, turn out. Usually, turnout falls more for young people than for older generations between presidential and midterm elections (hence the \u201cboom and bust\u201d risk). But in 2018, robust youth turnout helped power the Democratic gains. Large-scale polls focused particularly on young adults (such as the Harvard Institute of Politics survey) have found them expressing levels of interest comparable to 2018. Yet their participation in early voting has been lackluster, and several recent national surveys (such as CNN\u2019s poll last week) found their engagement lagging. If turnout among young adults disappoints on Tuesday, it will strengthen those Democrats who argue the party must prioritize regaining ground among middle-income, middle-aged voters, especially those without college degrees. (That includes non-college Latinos, particularly men, who may continue to drift away from Democrats at least somewhat this week.) The sharpest post-election debates among Democrats are likely to revolve around whether the party must embrace more conservative approaches on crime and immigration, two issues Republicans wielded to powerful effect, in order to earn a second look from more non-college educated voters across racial lines. History says that a bad result on Tuesday need not panic Democrats about 2024 (though, in practice, it probably will). Midterms have not had much value forecasting the result of the presidential election two years later. Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush had relatively good first-term midterms and then lost their reelection races. The president (or his party) did lose the White House two years after bad midterms in 1958, 1966, 1974 and 2018. But Harry Truman in 1948, Ronald Reagan in 1984, Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012 all won reelection, usually convincingly, two years after stinging midterm losses. Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist who has built models that project presidential outcomes based on economic and public opinion data, says the results of the midterm add literally no predictive value to the forecasts. The 2024 presidential election will begin almost immediately after Tuesday \u2013 probably before all the last votes are counted. Though midterm gains are the rule for the party out of power, Trump is likely to interpret GOP victories as a clarion call for his return; aides say he could announce a 2024 candidacy as soon as this month. White House officials believe Biden is certain to run if Trump does because he views the former president as an existential threat to American democracy. On Election Day 2024, the combined age of these two men will be nearly 160 years. Polls show that one of the few areas of broad public agreement is that most Americans do not want either to run again. Yet, long before any newly elected officials take office, or any gavels in Congress change hands, the first consequence of Tuesday\u2019s bitterly fought election may be to place America more firmly on the path toward exactly such a rematch. And this time, such a confrontation could occur with the electoral machinery in decisive states under control of Trump allies who share his willingness to tilt or even subvert the system. Whatever storms rattle the political system this week, the real tempest won\u2019t arrive until 2024 \u2013 and it may bring the greatest strain on the nation\u2019s fundamental cohesion since the Civil War.",

            "article_content": "GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who also serves as a pilot in the Air National Guard, is sounding the alarm about plans to cut funding for a little-known military surveillance aircraft that law enforcement officials tell CNN is an essential tool for dismantling drug trafficking organizations and has helped them take tens of thousands of illegal fentanyl pills off the streets last month alone. Kinzinger is among a small group of Air National Guard pilots who operate the twin-engine RC-26 aircraft and have helped law enforcement agencies target large shipments of fentanyl that are flowing into the US from across the border. But despite being described as an essential asset for law enforcement officials on the ground as they carry out raids and serve search warrants, the aircraft currently finds itself on the chopping block as Air Force leaders are planning to scrap the program, he told CNN. Opioid Crisis Fast Facts \u201cLaw enforcement lives have been saved by having this asset available,\u201d according to Kinzinger. \u201cWe can see anything weird that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said, adding that pilots can also follow suspects with their aerial camera without them knowing, allowing agents to maintain the element of surprise. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saving it every year piecemeal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guard has made it very clear. It\u2019s gone in April.\u201d Law enforcement officials from around the country and National Guard pilots who fly the RC-26 have appealed directly to Air Force leaders in Washington to keep the plane or provide a capable replacement, according to multiple sources familiar with those discussions. But despite self-imposed limits to the types of operations that can be flown by RC-26 National Guard pilots, Air Force leaders have now decided they no longer want to fund piloted reconnaissance assets for border and counter-drug missions, claiming unmanned drones can be offered up to fill that need, Kinzinger said. Supporters of the aircraft like Kinzinger say, in reality, the Air Force does not currently have a plan to replace the capabilities provided by the RC-26 if the program is shuttered. The Air Force has determined that divestment of the RC-26 \u201cleaves no capability gap\u201d and the service possesses sufficient \u201cIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance assets\u201d to support the needs of law enforcement authorities, Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek told CNN in response to questions about the future of the aircraft. A law enforcement official who spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about his opposition to the Air Force\u2019s plans to get rid of the aircraft, said doing so would take away the biggest advantage officers have over drug trafficking organizations that are currently \u201cflooding the market\u201d with large quantities of fentanyl and killing swaths of Americans in the process. Drug overdose death rates highest among American Indian people and middle-age Black men, study shows \u201cI know the Air Force is trying to say there are other options \u2026 but they don\u2019t have the same capabilities,\u201d the law enforcement official, who has routinely requested assistance from Air National Guard pilots operating the RC-26, said. \u201cIt would be a great loss for us in law enforcement,\u201d he added, noting it allows police departments to work more cases and spend less money on things like overtime for officers. While the RC-26 is used for a variety of missions, it has proven to be very effective in helping law enforcement agencies not only seize large amounts of fentanyl but also arresting and building cases against violent drug traffickers bringing the deadly substance into the US. Outfitted with a range of surveillance gear, including infrared imaging systems and secure radio communications, the Air Force\u2019s small fleet of RC-26 aircraft has played a prominent role in several recent operations targeting illicit shipments of fentanyl by serving as the preverbal eye-in-the sky for agents and officers on the ground, according to current and former officials. An agent or police officer is often on-board the aircraft to direct the pilot where to go and, working in tandem, they are able to collect information to help inform the decision-making of law enforcement officials on the ground in real time as they execute search warrants and conduct raids. Over the last two weeks in Arizona, the relatively obscure turboprop plane was involved in three separate fentanyl seizures of 22,500 pills each, according to law enforcement data obtained by CNN. Each seizure prevented 10,000 potential deaths, according to a US official familiar with the operations, who noted that the DEA says four pills in 10 have a lethal amount of fentanyl in them. Customs and Border Protection seizes shipment of fentanyl hidden in pill bottles But despite proving itself to be a valuable asset for drug interdiction, particularly at a time when the Biden administration is facing increasing pressure to stop the flow of fentanyl coming into the US from across the border, funding for the RC-26 aircraft is again on the chopping block. Air Force officials believe that the relatively small amount of money used to keep the current fleet of 11 RC-26 planes in the air would be better spent elsewhere. If a House amendment to provide more funding for the aircraft fails to make it through conference and is not included in Congress\u2019 next defense spending bill, the plane will be \u201cgone in April,\u201d according to Kinzinger. The cost of maintaining all 11 RC-26s is between $25 and $31 million per year, according to a source familiar with the program, who note that is a \u201cless than a drop in the bucket\u201d considering the annual defense spending bill ranges in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Kinzinger has sent a letter to the Armed Services Committees requesting they keep the current language related to funding for the RC-26 in its next defense spending bill, which would keep the aircraft around for at least one more year and require an independent assessment of how the National Guard could replace it, with a cost analysis. But even if that happens, the aircraft\u2019s long-term survival remains in question, as does the future success of the specialized missions it currently flies. Kinzinger is not alone in his support of the RC-26. CNN spoke with current and former law enforcement officials working in what are known as High Intensity Trafficking Areas who were adamant that the plane is a critical tool for stopping the flow of illicit drugs into the US. \u201cI think of the RC-26 as my state bird,\u201d said Rand Allison, a recently retired narcotics officer who spent over a decade working with RC-26 pilots as part of federal task forces focused on intercepting shipments of illicit drugs. Heightened public awareness about the dangers of fentanyl, bipartisan concerns and law enforcement statistics obtained by CNN also underscore how the RC-26 remains relevant despite claims by some air Force officials that it is too old. For example, data provided to CNN by the Southern Nevada High Impact Narcotics Task Force shows law enforcement agencies have used the RC-26 to seize 134,009 fentanyl pills and 15.7 pounds of pure fentanyl powder this year alone \u2013 a dramatic increase compared to the roughly 67,000 pills and 2.7 pounds of powder seized in 2021. In 2020, the task force documented its first seizures of fentanyl pills and powder, underscoring how the dramatic rise in law enforcement operations focused on these trafficking operations in particular. If the RC-26 program is ultimately scrapped, law enforcement officers would lose their best asset for dismantling trafficking operations bringing fentanyl into the US from across the border, Allison told CNN. The RC-26 aircraft was also used in three separate drug busts over the last three weeks where law enforcement agencies seized more than 60,000 fentanyl pills in total, according to federal drug task force data obtained by CNN. The first operation took place on October 18 in Las Vegas, Nevada, where the DEA seized 21,500 fentanyl pills. CBP officers seize more than $330K in fentanyl at Hidalgo International Bridge in Texas Exactly one week later, agents with the Department of Homeland Security Investigations division carried out the bust in Tucson that yielded more than 25,000 pills. The next day, a HIS team in Phoenix, Arizona seized an additional 5,000 pills and are building a much larger case, according to a law enforcement official familiar with operation. Still, one law enforcement official who regularly works with Air National Guard pilots to conduct counter-drug operations acknowledged feeling like they are \u201cwinning many battles but losing the war when it comes to fentanyl,\u201d making the RC-26\u2019s survival even more imperative. Over the last eight years, Kinzinger has been at the forefront of efforts to save his plane from extinction and preserve its ability to fly the type of missions that have endeared it to law enforcement officials across various agencies. Now, the RC-26 is again at risk of being phased out due to the shifting priorities of Air Force leaders that do not include flying border or counter-drug missions, according to the Republican lawmaker, who opted not to run for re-election but is using the final months of his time in Congress, in part, to advocate for the aircraft\u2019s survival. If that happens, the Air Force will also lose more than 60 Air National Guard pilots who are trained to fly the RC-26, Kinzinger added, noting the service is already suffering from a pilot shortage.",

            "article_content": "The race for the House is tilting strongly toward the GOP, but the struggle for Senate control is still very much a slog that could go either way, even as late-breaking national winds favor the party out of power. Every race will matter on Election Day as Republicans look to win control of the evenly divided chamber and severely curtail the second half of President Joe Biden\u2019s term. Democrats have a shot in large part because the battleground states on the Senate map were mostly won by Biden in 2020, albeit narrowly. And even though Biden is deeply unpopular in many of those states two years later, Democratic incumbents and challengers amassed massive sums of money that allowed them to run on their own brands throughout the summer while their Republican opponents limped out of contentious primaries. This is where the nitty-gritty of campaign spending makes a difference: Candidates get more favorable advertising rates than the super PACs and outside groups that have had to come in and make up the difference for some Donald Trump-backed GOP nominees with lackluster fundraising.   Democrats\u2019 challenge in the final days of the midterm elections is getting their base to turn out and persuading those remaining undecided voters \u2013 especially those who voted for Biden two years ago but are dissatisfied with him today \u2013 to stick with the president\u2019s party. That\u2019ll be easier said than done. Just 41% of US adults approved of Biden\u2019s performance, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released Wednesday. And Republican voters expressed greater engagement with this year\u2019s midterms than Democrats across multiple questions gauging voters\u2019 likelihood to vote. That president\u2019s party often loses seats in Congress during the first midterms of a new administration, and lower Democratic enthusiasm would suggest we\u2019re on track for history to repeat itself. The enthusiasm gap (favoring Republicans by 14 points) is similar to the partisan gap in CNN\u2019s polling from 2010, when Republicans gained seats in the first midterm of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. This year\u2019s key issues for voters would also seem to advantage Republicans. More than half of likely voters in CNN\u2019s new poll identified the economy and inflation \u2013 a central component of GOP attack ads \u2013 as the most important factor in their vote for Congress. The Supreme Court\u2019s late June ruling overturning Roe v. Wade injected uncertainty into the political landscape, with a majority of Americans disapproving of that decision. But only 15% of likely voters in CNN\u2019s poll said abortion was the most important issue determining their vote. More broadly, nearly three-quarters of Americans think things in the country are going badly. These scenarios could play out on election night And yet, what\u2019s keeping this cycle interesting is the unpredictability and relative messiness of the Senate map \u2013 with races sometimes moving in different directions. Despite Republicans picking up momentum across the country, for example, the seat most likely to flip is a GOP-held seat, not a Democratic-held one. Pennsylvania \u2013 where GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring \u2013 tops the list, as it has since CNN first started compiling these rankings at the start of the cycle in early 2021. Rankings are based on CNN\u2019s reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. And two other GOP-held open seats \u2013 North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 have proved to be surprisingly competitive for Democrats this year, even if they\u2019re much less likely to flip. But the race that could matter more than any other is a seat Democrats flipped last year. If neither candidate receives a majority of the vote in Georgia on November 8, the race will advance to a December 6 runoff. And if Senate control hinges on the Peach State \u2013 as it did in 2020 \u2013 we\u2019ll have to wait another month to learn which party holds the majority. Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) The Keystone State rounds out the cycle where it began \u2013 as the Senate seat most likely to flip. The race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey represents Democrats\u2019 best pickup opportunity. Biden narrowly won the commonwealth in 2020, after Trump had carried it in 2016, making it a pivotal battleground for the midterms and the next presidential contest. The Senate race has tightened as Republican Mehmet Oz consolidates support from Republicans after making it through a nasty primary with Trump\u2019s endorsement. Democrat John Fetterman, the current lieutenant governor, held a slim lead over the celebrity surgeon in a recent New York Times/Siena poll. But that was notably conducted in large part before their late October debate, when the visible effects of Fetterman\u2019s May stroke raised some concern, even among his supporters, that he might not be able to win over undecided voters. Still, only 3% of voters in a new Monmouth University poll said the debate had caused them to reconsider their choice in the race. And 39% of registered voters in a Fox News survey taken after the debate said they were concerned Fetterman wasn\u2019t healthy enough to do the job effectively \u2013 a 5-point increase since that question was asked in September \u2013 compared with 58% who weren\u2019t concerned. Democrats, meanwhile, have seized on Oz\u2019s comments during the debate that the discussion over abortion should be left to \u201cwomen, doctors, local political leaders,\u201d with Senate Majority PAC using it to link him to GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, who\u2019s trailing in his race. Fetterman stood at 50% to Oz\u2019s 46% among likely voters in a CNN Poll of Polls, which averages four most recent surveys that meet CNN\u2019s standards, including the Times/Siena poll and others conducted mostly before the debate. The good news for Fetterman, even as his own negatives have gone up, is that Oz\u2019s negatives remain relatively high \u2013 17% of Republicans and more than half of independents had an unfavorable view of the celebrity surgeon in the Times survey \u2013 and the Democrat continues to outpace Oz on the question of which candidate understands the concerns of everyday Pennsylvanians, according to the Monmouth survey. Biden and former President Barack Obama are rallying with Fetterman in Philadelphia on the final weekend before Election Day \u2013 the rare competitive Senate battleground that\u2019s playing host to the president. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto The supremacy of voters\u2019 economic concerns is bad news for Democrats in Nevada. The state has been hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and average gas prices remain near $5 a gallon. Furthermore, Nevada\u2019s transient population makes it tough for first-term incumbents to establish a strong brand. That\u2019s complicating Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s key task \u2013 winning over voters dissatisfied with Biden and the direction of the country. Her favorability rating stood at 39% among likely voters in the New York Times/Siena poll (the same as GOP challenger Adam Laxalt\u2019s), which was about on par with the percentage of likely voters who approved of Biden\u2019s job performance. However, her share of the vote in recent polling is above Biden\u2019s approval rating, giving Democrats confidence that she has a path to overperform the president. Cortez Masto and Laxalt were tied at 47% in the Times poll \u2013 a similar finding to a recent CBS poll and CNN polling from early October, which showed no clear leader. Republicans are blaming Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator, for a litany of concerns \u2013 from higher inflation to \u201cchaos at the border\u201d \u2013 all with the message that she\u2019s a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for Biden. Cortez Masto and Democrats have attacked Laxalt over abortion \u2013 although he says he does not support a national ban and has pointed out that the right to an abortion is settled law in Nevada. They\u2019ve also tried tying Laxalt \u2013 a former state attorney general and the grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name \u2013 to Trump and highlighted his efforts, as Trump\u2019s Nevada campaign co-chair, in the filing of lawsuits related to the 2020 election. But perhaps in a recognition that economic concerns outweigh abortion or democracy as issues that are important to voters, Democrats \u2013 including Obama, who rallied the party faithful in Nevada on Tuesday \u2013 have tried to flip the script on higher gas prices, blaming them on corporations and tying Laxalt to \u201cbig oil.\u201d Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock No race has seen more drama in the last month than Georgia, where Trump\u2019s hand-picked candidate, Herschel Walker, is facing allegations from two women that he urged them to get abortions, which he has denied. But the accusations, which have played into the Democratic narrative about the retired football star being a hypocrite, don\u2019t seem to have done much damage to his standing in the race against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who\u2019s seeking a full six-year term. After at first steering clear of the allegations, Warnock used them in a recent ad against his opponent. But the New York Times/Siena poll showed no clear leader, which was a tightening from a Quinnipiac University survey conducted after news of the first allegation that had given Warnock a 7-point lead. Warnock continues to enjoy stronger favorability ratings than his GOP challenger, whose image is underwater. The Democrat\u2019s favorability ratings are also higher than Biden\u2019s approval \u2013 a potentially significant separation in a state the president flipped by less than half a point in 2020. But the gubernatorial race in Georgia could help carry Walker across the finish line with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp appearing to have the advantage over Democrat Stacey Abrams in a rematch of their 2018 contest. Where that finish line is, though, remains to be seen \u2013 if neither Senate nominee surpasses 50% of the vote on November 8, the top two finishers will advance to a December 6 runoff. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson As the only Republican senator running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020, Sen. Ron Johnson is the chamber\u2019s most vulnerable GOP incumbent. A Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday showed no clear leader in the race between Johnson and Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes \u2013 similar to a CNN survey from mid October \u2013 which is comparable to the close governor\u2019s race. The race seems to have moved in the GOP\u2019s favor since the summer when Barnes emerged from the August primary relatively unscathed after his opponents had dropped out beforehand. Republicans sought to define Barnes after Labor Day with a blitz of advertising, particularly hitting him over crime and his past support for redirecting funding from police. (Barnes has called it a \u201clie\u201d that he supports defunding the police.) Democrats have tried to turn the crime argument back on Johnson by pointing to some of the statements he has made downplaying the January 6 insurrection and trying to use Johnson\u2019s past remarks on Social Security against him. Biden only carried Wisconsin by less than half a point in 2020, so it\u2019s still a tough state, with an even tougher national political environment for Barnes. Independents, for example, were breaking for Johnson in the Marquette survey (53% to 46% among likely voters), and 68% of registered voters said they were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about an inflation \u2013 an issue that favors Republicans. Barnes was polling at 48% in the Marquette poll, slightly lower than Biden\u2019s percentage of the Wisconsin vote in 2020. That\u2019s one reason why Obama, who received a higher 53% in the state in 2012 while winning a second term, rallied with Barnes in the final weeks of the campaign. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly The race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican Blake Masters has also narrowed \u2013 a Fox News poll released Tuesday shows no clear leader with Masters picking up support from Republicans. But Kelly, who won a 2020 special election and is running for a full six-year term, has proved a much more resilient Democrat to tarnish than some of the GOP\u2019s other targets. That has kept this race \u2013 in a purple state Biden won by less than half a point \u2013 more competitive for Democrats than it probably should be given the national environment. (A CNN poll and the Times/Siena poll both gave him a 6-point lead over Masters.)  A retired astronaut with impressive fundraising totals, Kelly has tried to distance himself from his party on immigration \u2013 as he did during their debate last month \u2013 and largely had the airwaves to himself to sell that message. Masters is getting some late help from other Republican spenders \u2013 including Trump\u2019s super PAC and the political arm of the Club for Growth \u2013 after the Senate Leadership Fund had to cut its spending here to divert resources to other states. A venture capitalist who has the backing of both Trump and Peter Thiel, Masters tried to dial back some of his more extreme rhetoric on abortion and election denialism after winning the GOP primary. But the former president recently urged him to go \u201cstronger\u201d on his unfounded election fraud claims. Masters may have gotten an assist Tuesday, when the libertarian nominee, who was pulling at 1% in the Times survey, dropped out. But with voters already voting, it\u2019s unclear how much of a difference the move will actually make. This is another state where the governor\u2019s race could affect the Senate contest since Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake is considered a much stronger candidate than Masters. Given their struggles in this race so far, though, Republicans will interpret Masters doing well here on election night as a sign that the environment is even better for them than they had expected. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) The race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr looks closer than many observers had expected at the beginning of the cycle. Democrat Cheri Beasley and Republican Rep. Ted Budd were tied among registered voters in a late October Marist poll. (Budd, a third-term congressman, had a small edge among definite voters.) North Carolina is accustomed to close elections \u2013 Trump only won it by about 1 point in 2020. But Democrats haven\u2019t won a Senate race here since 2008, the last time the state went blue at the presidential level. Budd, Trump\u2019s first nonincumbent Senate endorsee of the cycle, has been outraised by Beasley. And even though he\u2019s benefited from outside spending that attacks Beasley on crime, the Democrat\u2019s campaign has been able to take advantage of the more favorable advertising rates that candidates get. A former state Supreme Court chief justice, who would be the state\u2019s first Black senator, Beasley has been trying to run as the outsider. \u201cWashington politicians like Ted Budd aren\u2019t listening,\u201d she says in a recent spot about high prices and stagnant wages. Her ads don\u2019t mention that she\u2019s a Democrat \u2013 or that her party holds power in Washington. Besides hitting Budd on abortion, Democrats are also trying to make an economic counterargumen. Budd \u201cvoted against lowering drug prices for people like us,\u201d one senior says in a Beasley ad, referring to a provision in Democrats\u2019 health care, climate and tax package that allows Medicare to negotiate certain prescription drug prices. Democrats have long hoped that Beasley could help energize parts of their base that don\u2019t usually turn out in midterms \u2013 like rural Black voters and young voters. But national Democrats haven\u2019t been able to pour as much money into this race given the number of incumbents they\u2019re defending. Still, the Senate Majority PAC did up its spending in the state this fall, suggesting Democrats think Beasley has a shot. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan This race\u2019s position on the rankings continues to be one of the biggest surprises of the 2022 cycle. Democrats and Republicans alike expected this contest to jump near the top of the list if and when GOP Gov. Chris Sununu got into the race. But he decided late last year not to run. Instead, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who had raised virtually no money, is taking on first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan after making it through the September primary. That doesn\u2019t mean this isn\u2019t still a competitive race \u2013 especially given the national environment. But Bolduc cuts a very different profile than Sununu, a Trump critic who supports abortion rights, in a state that Biden carried by 7 points and that\u2019s been trending blue in federal elections. And yet, Sununu, who previously called Bolduc a \u201cconspiracy theory type candidate,\u201d is now supporting the GOP nominee, who\u2019s repeatedly pushed election falsehoods. (Asked about that choice, the governor told CNN this week that no one should be a \u201cone-issue voter.\u201d) Bolduc also recently picked up an endorsement from Trump. Despite some Republicans coming to his side, both the Senate Leadership Fund and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have cut funding here as they\u2019ve diverted resources to higher-priority races. That\u2019s accentuated the resource disparity between Bolduc, who had raised about $1 million at of the end of the Federal Election Commission\u2019s pre-general reporting period on October 19, compared with Hassan\u2019s $39 million. Still, Hassan\u2019s closing ad, in which she talks about \u201cstanding up to the president \u2013 whatever it takes,\u201d speaks to her vulnerability this year given the national environment, which even her massive fundraising advantage may not be able to erase. Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) The race for retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman\u2019s seat wasn\u2019t supposed to be competitive \u2013 Trump won the state by 8 points and, with the exception of Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s success, it\u2019s been trending red over the past decade. Given those fundamentals and the national mood, Republicans still very much have the edge here, which is why it\u2019s in the second half of this list. But there\u2019s no denying that Trump\u2019s hand-picked Republican candidate, J.D. Vance, struggled to raise money and consolidate GOP support after a divisive primary. The diversion of Republican super PAC spending from more reliable battlegrounds to shore him up in Ohio speaks to his weaknesses as a candidate. After Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan had the airwaves mostly to himself over the summer, the Senate Leadership Fund has been trying to poke holes in his moderate image by tying him to Biden. Still, Ryan\u2019s vast fundraising advantage has allowed him to run plenty of ads in which he says he has sided with Trump on trade and takes on his own party. The candidates were essentially tied in a late October Marist survey, which likely speaks to this particular matchup given that the same survey showed the gubernatorial contest not even close. But Republicans are confident, given the makeup of the state, that the remaining undecided voters in the Senate race, who made up 8% of registered voters in that Marist survey, will break late for Vance. It\u2019s probably no accident that Trump is holding a rally in Ohio the day before Election Day. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio Florida voted for Trump by a smaller margin than Ohio, but for the second month in a row, the Sunshine State has ranked lower on the list of seats most likely to flip. That\u2019s because Republican Sen. Marco Rubio \u2013 although he\u2019s been outraised by a strong challenger in Democratic Rep. Val Demings \u2013 is a two-term incumbent who seems to be doing everything he needs to do to win in this environment. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, has leaned heavily into her law enforcement experience. \u201cThe Senate could use a cop on the beat,\u201d she says in one spot in which she explains her opposition to defunding the police. But that hasn\u2019t been enough to blunt Republican attacks that she\u2019s prioritized Washington over the police by siding with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Incumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet is used to close races \u2013 he won his last reelection in 2016 by just 6 points against a GOP challenger whom the national party had abandoned. He\u2019s facing a much more formidable opponent this time in businessman Joe O\u2019Dea, who has expressed support for abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and has criticized Trump. He told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash last month that he would \u201cactively\u201d campaign against the former president, which inspired Trump to lash out at the GOP nominee. That might actually help O\u2019Dea in a state Biden carried by more than 13 points in 2020. And in a sign of the GOP\u2019s brewing divisions ahead of 2024, the race has become a point of divergence between Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has backed O\u2019Dea. The Senate Leadership Fund gave $1.25 million to a pro-O\u2019Dea super PAC \u2013 the same amount it gave to a group supporting Republican challenger Tiffany Smiley in Washington state. But Biden\u2019s smaller margin in Colorado (he won Washington by 19 points) makes it more likely to flip if the national environment gives Republicans a chance to pick up a seat in a state seen as safely blue.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, who\u2019s vying to hold onto her New Hampshire seat next week, didn\u2019t hesitate to criticize President Joe Biden\u2019s administration in a debate with Republican challenger Don Bolduc on Wednesday \u2013 especially distancing herself from the administration\u2019s handling of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. New Hampshire\u2019s Senate seat is a critical one for Democrats to hold if the party is to retain its narrow Senate majority.   Hassan, a former governor, is widely viewed as the favorite in a state that backed Biden by seven points in 2020, and she has a massive fundraising advantage over Bolduc. But with tailwinds blowing in Republicans\u2019 direction and the economy top of mind for voters, there are signs this race is still competitive. Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to flip the evenly divided chamber, where Vice President Kamala Harris has the tie-breaking vote. Senate Majority PAC, the top Democratic super PAC engaged in Senate races, just added $600,000 to its final week ad reservations in the New Hampshire race. The Democratic spending comes after the top GOP super PAC, Senate Leadership Fund, pulled out of the race in mid-October amid concerns about Bolduc\u2019s electability and the need to divert resources to higher-priority states. In their third and final debate on Wednesday, Hassan said she supported an investigation \u201cto hold the administration accountable\u201d on the Afghanistan withdrawal, while Bolduc said the United States under Biden has \u201cno diplomatic leadership; no political leadership\u201d in international affairs as a result of the withdrawal. They also touched on other issues like the 2020 election, abortion and the border. Here are three takeaways from their debate: Hassan attempted to highlight Bolduc\u2019s history of embracing and parroting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. She said the retired Army brigadier general spent a year \u201cstoking the big lie, saying it was stolen.\u201d \u201cHe then has begun to cast doubt on the 2022 election, now saying that there will be ballots dumped in the middle of the night,\u201d she said. Bolduc, though, attempted to avoid revisiting or repeating his false claims about election fraud, accusing Hassan of \u201cgrandstanding\u201d and saying that \u201cwe need to focus on the future.\u201d He also criticized the debate\u2019s moderators, calling the question about election denialism a softball. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what she needed, right, because she can\u2019t hit a fastball,\u201d he said. Their debate opened with a divergence on abortion rights, an issue that had also played a prominent role in their earlier showdowns. Bolduc \u2013 who earlier in the campaign said Granite Staters should \u201crejoice\u201d over the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to reverse Roe v. Wade in June \u2013 said he would vote against any federal abortion ban. \u201cI have promised all Granite Staters that I will not vote for any federal legislation that has to do with abortion. It is a states\u2019 rights issue,\u201d Bolduc said. Hassan said that Bolduc was trying to \u201cconceal his record\u201d and gloss over comments he\u2019d made earlier in the race. She did not directly answer a question about whether she would support any limits on abortion rights or would be willing to strike a compromise on the issue. \u201cThis is about a fundamental right of a woman to make her own health care decisions and her own health and safety. And I believe those decisions have to be made by a woman and her doctor,\u201d Hassan said. The Democratic senator said Bolduc would be \u201ca yes vote for a nationwide abortion ban.\u201d \u201cThat is an absolute lie,\u201d Bolduc shot back. Hassan sought to demonstrate her bipartisan bona fides in a discussion of slowing the flow of fentanyl into the United States, saying she \u201cstood with President Trump as he signed a bill into law that gave our border patrol better technology\u201d to detect the synthetic opioid in 2018. She said she supports \u201cmuch stronger security at our border, including personnel, including advanced technology.\u201d Bolduc, meanwhile, said the United States has left its border with Mexico \u201cwide open\u201d for drugs and human trafficking. \u201cThis is a problem that the Biden administration and Maggie Hassan has created,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Control of the US Senate will be decided next week in cross-pressured states where most voters disapprove of President Joe Biden\u2019s performance but also express unfavorable views about their state\u2019s Republican Senate nominee. Public polls show Biden\u2019s job approval rating is consistently below 50%, and often well below that, in all the states most likely to determine the Senate majority \u2013 even though they\u2019re almost all states he carried in 2020. Over the past three decades, it has become increasingly rare for Senate candidates on either side to win election in states where voters hold such negative views of a president from their own party.   In this stormy sea, the biggest lifeline still available for Democrats is the large number of voters in those battleground states who view the Republican Senate candidates as extreme, unqualified, or both. Recent public polls by CNN and other media organizations have found that more voters hold unfavorable than favorable views of virtually all the GOP nominees in the key states \u2013 including Blake Masters in Arizona, Herschel Walker in Georgia, Adam Laxalt in Nevada, Don Bolduc in New Hampshire, J.D. Vance in Ohio, Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. Negative assessments of the Democratic candidates in those states have been rising as well, as they face a barrage of Republican attack ads, often tying them to Biden. Even so, in most (though not all) cases, voters hold a relatively more favorable view of the Democratic candidate than the Republican, polls show. The fulcrum in the campaign\u2019s final days may be whether the last remaining voters are moved more by these personal doubts about the GOP contenders or by their policy objections to Biden\u2019s performance at a time when polls show that most Americans disapprove of how he has handled crime, the border, and above all the economy and inflation. The recent CNN polls in several key Senate races show that a large, and potentially decisive, slice of voters both disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance and view the GOP nominee unfavorably: 9% in Wisconsin, 11% in Nevada, 13% in Pennsylvania and 15% in Arizona, according to detailed results provided by the CNN polling unit. \u201cThe real question comes down to that group of independents in the middle, and who votes at the end,\u201d says Paul Maslin, a long-time Democratic pollster. \u201cIs it people saying, \u2018I hate inflation, crime is wrecking this big city I live in,\u2019 or people saying, \u2018I\u2019m sorry but Herschel Walker is a clown, Mehmet Oz is a clown. \u2026 Blake Masters is a joke,\u2019 and they go back to [the Democrats]? I don\u2019t know. I honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d This tension represents another dimension of the \u201cdouble negative election,\u201d in which most voters are expressing doubts about each party. Its impact is evident in the contrasting ad strategies of the two sides. While Republicans have spent heavily tying Democratic candidates to Biden, particularly around inflation, crime and the border, Democrats have devoted much of their messaging to raising doubts about their Republican rivals, particularly on abortion and in many cases their personal ethics. Republicans are working to nationalize the Senate races, while Democrats are trying to localize and personalize them. The challenge for Democrats in this situation is the breadth and consistency of Biden\u2019s struggles. Nationally, Biden\u2019s job approval rating on election day next week may not look much different than the modest 45% that exit polls recorded for then-President Donald Trump in 2018. But there is a key difference between the two men\u2019s position. Although Trump\u2019s national number was relatively weak, his approval rating on election day 2018 reached above 50% in multiple states, exit polls found. Notably, Trump was at 50% or more in all four states where Republican challengers beat Democratic Senate incumbents that year \u2013 Florida, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. That\u2019s a stark contrast to now, when public polls do not show Biden at 50% in any of the states with the most closely contested Senate races and more often place him somewhere between about 45% at the high end and 36-40% at the low. The most recent CNN polls, for instance, put Biden\u2019s approval at 45% in Pennsylvania, 43% in Wisconsin and just 41% in Nevada and Arizona. Recent polls by the non-partisan Marist Institute for Public Opinion put Biden\u2019s approval at 40% or less in North Carolina, Ohio and even Colorado, a state he won by double digits. New York Times/Siena College polls released Monday likewise showed Biden\u2019s approval rating below 40% in Arizona, Nevada and Georgia and only slightly above that threshold in Pennsylvania. Democratic hopes over the summer that Biden\u2019s approval rating would steadily rise through Election Day, lifting their candidates in the process, have been dashed largely because of the persistence of the highest inflation in 40 years. \u201cThe big problem for Democrats is things have not gotten better in people\u2019s eyes, regardless of what they have done in passing legislation and what good it might do in the future,\u201d says Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. \u201cIf inflation had come down from where it has been, they would be in better shape. But you can\u2019t convince people that things are going better when their own experience tells them that it\u2019s not.\u201d Weak numbers in a state for a president have increasingly spelled defeat for Senate candidates from his party. In Senate races, the unmistakable long-term trend is for attitudes about the sitting president to exert increasing influence over the results, often overshadowing views of the competing candidates. In many ways, Senate (and even more so House races) have become more akin to contests in a parliamentary system, where fewer voters are weighing the relative individual merits of the two contenders and instead are basing their decision more on which party they want to control Congress \u2013 a decision shaped heavily by their views about the incumbent president. \u201cOver the past twenty or thirty years, what we\u2019ve seen is a growing nationalization of these congressional races where there is a closer connection between opinions about national issues and national political leaders and how people vote in these House and Senate elections,\u201d says Abramowitz. \u201cIt used to be easier for incumbents to run pretty far ahead of a president from their own party\u2019s approval rating based on their reputation in their state or district, their constituency service, name recognition, things that you gain from being an incumbent. Over time that value has decreased.\u201d The results in Senate races through the 21st century underscore Abramowitz\u2019 point. In 2018, Republican Senate candidates lost all 10 races in states where the exit polls recorded Trump\u2019s approval at 48% or less. In the GOP\u2019s 2010 sweep, Democrats lost 13 of the 15 Senate races in states where exit polls put then-President Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating at 47% or less. During the Democratic \u201cthumping\u201d in 2006, Republicans lost 19 of the 20 Senate races in the states where exit polls showed George W. Bush with an approval rating of 45% or below. In each case, despite the national tide flowing against them, the president\u2019s party won most of the Senate races in states where his approval ratings exceeded those levels. This history means that to hold the Senate, Democrats will need multiple candidates to run farther ahead of the approval rating for a president from their own party than almost all candidates on either side have managed in recent years. And the breadth of Biden\u2019s weakness means that Democratic candidates today are confronting a near universal undertow that Republicans did not face as uniformly in 2018. Still the 2018 precedent offers some hope for Democrats that they can separate themselves from views about the sitting president. In most cases, the Senate results in competitive states that year did follow attitudes about the president: Republicans won seven races where Trump\u2019s approval rating stood at 49% or above, while losing, as noted above, all 10 where he reached only 48% or less. But four other Democrats in 2018 defied that trend to win in states where Trump\u2019s approval stood at 50% or more. Those four Democratic victors included incumbents Joe Manchin in West Virginia, Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio as well as challenger Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona. Just like Democrats now, all of them then had to win in a state where majority opinion about the president favored the other party. In 2018, that meant they were running upstream against a majority that approved of a Republican president; today it means that Democratic candidates are facing a majority that disapproves of a Democratic president. Manchin, Tester, Brown and Sinema all won because they captured a higher share of voters who approved of Trump\u2019s performance than their Republican opponent won among voters who disapproved of his performance, according to exit polls. Now Democratic candidates in the decisive states face the reverse challenge: they must win a higher share of voters who disapprove of Biden than their Republican opponent wins among the voters who approve of him. So far, public polls show Democratic Senate candidates meeting that test to varying degrees. In the latest round of CNN state surveys conducted by SSRS in mid-October, for instance, Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly in Arizona and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, as well as challengers Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin and John Fetterman in Pennsylvania were all winning at least 11% of voters who disapproved of Biden and losing no more than 4% of voters who approved of his performance. Kelly, most strikingly, captured almost one-fifth of voters who disapproved of Biden against Masters in the CNN Arizona poll. The New York Times/Siena polls released Monday likewise showed Democrats winning about 15% of voters who disapproved of Biden in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania and, stunningly, nearly one-fourth of them in Arizona. Interactive: Six states to watch for the 2022 midterms J.B. Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC, the leading Democratic super PAC, argues that personal contrasts largely explain that unusually high Democratic support among voters dissatisfied with Biden. \u201cI agree with Mitch McConnell on one thing: candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome in Senate races,\u201d Poersch said. \u201cOur Democratic candidates have strong track records of delivering for their states and a demonstrated ability to create their own environment, while Republicans are offering up a roster of extremists who are totally out of step.\u201d But in the 2018 exit polls, no Republican Senate candidate ultimately won more than 8% of voters who disapproved of Trump, and many of them captured only 4-5%. That history raises the question of whether Democratic Senate candidates can sustain the elevated levels of support polls now record for them among voters who disapprove of Biden. They also face the very real risk that even if they can run unusually well among Biden disapprovers, it might still not be enough to survive if there are simply too many of those disapproving voters in the final electorate. The CNN mid-October polls raised that possibility by showing Cortez Masto and Barnes still narrowly trailing even though they were attracting double-digit support among voters who disapprove of Biden. Gene Ulm, a Republican pollster, says he believes the final electorate will tilt even more toward Republican voters dissatisfied with Biden than polls now project. The reason, he argues, is that in the end, disenchantment with current conditions and Biden\u2019s performance will turbocharge more turnout from Republicans, and depress turnout more from Democrats, than most models now anticipate. \u201cThe composition of the electorate \u2026 is going to crush everything,\u201d he says flatly. Even in such an environment, Ulm acknowledges, weak personal images may sink some GOP Senate (and governor) nominees. \u201cI think that is the only hope and it may save them against the weakest candidates,\u201d he says, \u201cbut not anybody other than that.\u201d He predicts that discontent with Biden and the desire for a change in direction will allow multiple Republican candidates to win who are viewed unfavorably by more voters than view them favorably. Mike Noble, an independent pollster in Phoenix, sees more opportunity for Democrats to separate from the president, at least in Arizona. In a poll released Monday by his firm, OH Predictive Insights, Noble said Kelly narrowly led Masters, even though a clear majority of Arizona likely voters expressed a negative view on Biden. One reason for Kelly\u2019s lead, Noble said, is that the poll found almost one-fifth of voters who were unfavorable toward Biden also expressed negative views about Masters. Those ambivalent voters, Noble said, were backing Kelly over Masters by more than eight-to-one. Noble says Kelly is benefiting from campaign fundamentals: the Democrat has significantly outspent, and also more successfully occupied the center, than his Republican rival. But Noble also believes that Kelly is surmounting disenchantment with Biden in part because some voters are already looking past the president as they assess the parties. \u201cThe [president\u2019s] job approval, for whatever reason, is not having as much effect,\u201d Noble says. \u201cPeople have accepted it\u2019s Joe Biden, and pat him on the head, push him along, so you are not seeing that direct connection\u201d to the Senate vote. The 2018 precedent testifies both to the opportunity that doubts about individual GOP Senate nominees create for Democrats \u2013 and also to its limits. One reason both Manchin and Tester survived \u2013 despite Trump\u2019s robust approval rating in their states that year \u2013 was that a majority of voters in the exit polls held a negative personal view about their Republican opponent. Exit polls did not measure personal favorability of the candidates in Ohio and Arizona that year, but pre-election polls also showed the GOP nominees in those states facing broadly negative assessments as well. On the other hand, Democratic incumbents Bill Nelson in Florida and Joe Donnelly in Indiana had slightly better net favorable ratings than their Republican opponents that year, the exit polls found. And yet both Democrats lost anyway, in states where most voters approved of Trump\u2019s performance. In other words, their personal favorability could not overcome majority opinion about the president that favored the other party. That\u2019s an ominous precedent for Democrats such as Cortez Masto, Warnock and even Kelly. The four Democrats who won in Trump-favoring states in 2018 show it\u2019s still possible for personal views about Senate candidates to outweigh broad assessments about the country\u2019s direction and the president\u2019s performance. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine provided another example in 2020 when she won reelection in a state where nearly three-fifths of voters disapproved of Trump because roughly one-fourth of those disapproving voters, an incredibly high number, voted for her anyway. Such exceptions have become rare in modern US politics. Because Biden\u2019s standing is so weak in so many places, to hold the Senate, Democrats will almost certainly need a lot more of them.",

            "article_content": "For all of former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to defeat Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp during the primary, the Republican governor is loath to criticize his party\u2019s most influential figure ahead of next week\u2019s general election.   Asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins why he thinks Trump has steered clear of the state since the primary, Kemp \u2013 who\u2019s facing a rematch with Democrat Stacey Abrams \u2013 was characteristically diplomatic. \u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019d have to ask him that question. Look, I\u2019m focusing on getting our vote out,\u201d Kemp told \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d in an interview broadcast Tuesday. \u201cI appreciate what President Trump did for the state of Georgia. His administration was incredible to work with,\u201d he added. \u201cThey did a lot of things to help us during the (Covid-19) pandemic and many other issues that we dealt with. We also did a lot of things to help them, to help the federal administration during\u201d the early stages of the pandemic, Kemp continued. But if Trump had his way, Kemp would not be on the ballot for reelection this fall. The former President recruited and campaigned for Kemp\u2019s primary challenger as he sought retribution for the governor\u2019s refusal to back his efforts to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 win in the state. But Kemp, unlike so many other Republicans around the country, proved to be politically invulnerable to Trump\u2019s wrath, soundly defeating former Sen. David Perdue for the GOP nomination \u2013 and is now favored to win a second term leading Georgia as he faces Abrams in a rematch of their 2018 matchup. Fetterman on debate: 'I thought it was important that I show up' If Kemp prevails \u2013 powered by a coalition of Trump voters, Republican Trump doubters and conservative-leaning swing voters \u2013 he will provide a blueprint for GOP candidates rooted in the fundamentals of Trumpism, but otherwise unwilling to submit to the former President\u2019s personal whims. For those in the GOP upset that it has tied itself so tightly to Trump, Kemp represents both the path not taken and, should he succeed, a potential road map for a potential post-Trump era. Still, Kemp was cautious when pressed on whether his potentially winning a second term next week provides proof-of-concept for Republicans trying to appeal to Trump voters without Trump himself in their corner. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of outside noise all over all these campaigns and I just haven\u2019t been focused on that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been focused on what Georgians want, on what Georgians need, whether they voted for me or not.\u201d But the governor, who served two terms as Georgia secretary of state before winning the top job in 2018 \u2013 when he narrowly defeated Abrams in one of that year\u2019s closest statewide races, did have a message to his party about their failure in 2020. Trump lost Georgia to Biden and both of the state\u2019s incumbent GOP senators were unseated by Democrats.   \u201cWe know the contrast with the other side,\u201d Kemp said of Democrats and Abrams. \u201cBut we also have to have it be a party that\u2019s for something. And I don\u2019t think in 2020 we did a good job, in some of our races, of letting people know what we\u2019re for, what our record is. Even when you disagree with people, if you stand for something, they have great appreciation for that.\u201d If Trump\u2019s great power is grabbing headlines, Kemp\u2019s might be in avoiding them \u2013 both when it comes to the former President and, more recently, the man who could be the next Republican senator from Georgia: Herschel Walker. Walker, who was encouraged to run and endorsed by Trump, is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in one of the tightest and most consequential Senate races of the year. In a body that is currently divided 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote, Georgia\u2019s choice could swing the balance of power back to Republicans less than two years after they lost it here in a pair of runoff elections. Kemp has all but stiff-armed the former football great on the campaign trail, mostly staying mum about Walker\u2019s race and, though he\u2019s endorsed and plans to vote for him, been sparing with any kind words. Describing the Senate contest to CNN, Kemp focused as much on pitching Walker as assailing Warnock and the Biden administration. \u201cIn that race, you\u2019re going to vote for a guy, our current senator, that\u2019s voted with Joe Biden 96% of the time, or you\u2019re going to vote for somebody that\u2019s going to go up there (to Capitol Hill) and try to do something about 40-year high inflation, terrible domestic energy policy that\u2019s led to high gas prices, literally a disaster at the border,\u201d Kemp said. Kemp similarly pivoted on the issue of the recent allegations from two women that Walker, who\u2019s said in the past that he supports a full federal abortion ban with no exceptions, encouraged them to get the procedure. Walker has repeatedly denied those accusations. \u201cI would just tell you to talk to Herschel Walker about his policies on abortion,\u201d Kemp said, before steering the question toward Abrams and Warnock and, eventually, talking about his own record. \u201cThe thing is, Georgians know where I\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve been consistent. Not all Georgians may \u2026 like all the policies that I\u2019ve fought for and got done in the legislature, but at least they know where I\u2019ve stood and I\u2019ve been transparent with them.\u201d Kemp opposes abortion rights and the state, in 2019, passed a bill that bans the procedure as early as six weeks, with some exceptions. That\u2019s before most women even know they\u2019re pregnant. Asked on the debate stage with Abrams on Sunday night whether he would sign further restrictions if the GOP-controlled state legislature delivered them to his desk, Kemp said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my desire to go back, to go move the needle any further,\u201d but stopped short of pledging a veto. As he\u2019s done on the campaign trail, Kemp, during two debates with Abrams and in speaking to CNN, tried to keep the focus on what he says he hears most from voters across the state: the economy and crime. Whether touting Georgia\u2019s successes or blaming the White House for the state and country\u2019s inflation troubles, Kemp  argued that no other issue is more prevalent in the minds of voters. This is a \u201cpocketbook election,\u201d Kemp told Collins in Folkston, Georgia, before turning his focus to national Democrats. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s 40-year high inflation; egg (prices) up 30%; milk, chicken up, 15, 17%; gas prices because of bad domestic energy policy. That\u2019s the number one issue. Sixty percent of Americans right now are living paycheck to paycheck, and thankfully they have a state government and a governor that\u2019s been fighting to help \u2018em fight through that.\u201d Interactive: Georgia, one of six states to watch for the 2022 midterms Abrams has pushed back against that message, arguing that Kemp has governed with the interests of the wealthy front of mind and effectively left behind working class Georgians. Before and during Kemp\u2019s administration, Georgia has refused federal Medicaid expansion funds under the Affordable Care Act, and the state\u2019s maternal mortality rate is among the worst in the country. But with early voting underway and ballots being cast in record numbers for the state, Kemp says he is confident that voters are confident in him \u2013 and that they want more of what he\u2019s promising. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a property tax relief grant. We\u2019re going to continue to be in the fight with our men and women in law enforcement. We\u2019re going to keep working on rural broadband,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting for that if you send us back.\u201d The process for deciding whether voters return Kemp to office for another term, though, has been fraught with controversy. Georgia\u2019s new elections law passed last year, known as SB 202, has been derided by Democrats and voting rights advocates for its new voting restrictions. Abrams has led the charge, but Biden offered some of the harshest criticism, describing the slate of laws as making \u201cJim Crow look like Jim Eagle.\u201d Kemp and his Republican allies have pushed back on that rhetoric, usually by pointing to increases in turnout. Early voting in this general election has provided them more fodder, with the state frequently reporting new turnout records. \u201cFor them to call it suppressive, the numbers just don\u2019t play that fact out,\u201d Kemp said, touting days added to the early voting schedule and downplaying rules making it more difficult to cast an absentee ballot. \u201cWe had a record vote in the primary and we\u2019re seeing it right now in the general election.\u201d No matter how his reelection bid breaks, Kemp knows of at least one thing he is sure to be doing after November 8. The governor\u2019s effort to avoid appearing before a special grand jury in Atlanta investigating Trump\u2019s attempts to undermine the 2020 election in Georgia failed and he\u2019s slated to testify. \u201cI can tell you,\u201d Kemp said of his forthcoming testimony, \u201cthat I will tell people, as I\u2019ve always done, I\u2019ll tell \u2018em the truth and I\u2019ll tell \u2018em that I followed the laws and the Constitution of this state.\u201d",

            "article_content": "You know Election Day is closing in when the kids are trick-or-treating. And with the costumes out, the picture for the Senate is clearer than ever. It is pretty clear from the polling that control of the Senate will likely come down to four races: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.   The math is simple. Democrats need to win three of these four races to maintain control of the Senate. For Republicans, it\u2019s a slightly easier climb as they need to win only two of these four races. But despite the ease of the equation, solving it is anything but easy. All of these races are well within the margin of error. Moreover, the states aren\u2019t all that similar in demographics, which means that it\u2019s plausible that any late movement or polling error could affect the states in different ways. Each state has unique issues affecting them, too. Arizona is the easiest race to understand. Democrats have won the last two Senate races in the state, after not having won one since 1988. They\u2019re powered by increasingly strong performances in the Phoenix suburbs among White college-educated voters and a reliable Hispanic base. (They\u2019re also helped by one of the largest Native American populations in the country.) Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly hasn\u2019t trailed in any poll released publicly. His advantage has slimmed in some recent surveys, though many of those are from outfits that don\u2019t meet CNN\u2019s standards for publications. On average, Kelly has been up by about 3 points over Republican Blake Masters. A New York Times/Siena College poll published Monday gave Kelly a 6-point lead over Masters. Masters\u2019 problem is fairly simple: His net favorability (favorable - unfavorable) rating is underwater. Unpopular Republican candidates is an issue that has plagued Republicans across the board. Meanwhile, Kelly\u2019s net favorability (and approval rating) has been positive. This has allowed Kelly to overcome President Joe Biden\u2019s own unpopularity in the state. Kelly\u2019s consistent lead may be why a number of analysts (though not this one) have viewed the Senate as coming down to the other three states. The best one for Republicans and arguably the most straightforward one is Nevada. The Times poll there out Monday and the average has the race tied between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt. Nevada seemed to be a state trending toward Democrats 10 years ago, after Barack Obama won it with ease in two consecutive elections. Republicans have lost the last two presidential elections in the state by decreasing margins, including a 2.4-point loss in 2020. Republicans have been helped by movement toward them among Hispanics, as well as a large base of White voters without a college degree. The state\u2019s economic base of tourism was hurt during the Covid-19 pandemic, when national Democrats were far more likely to push for Covid precautions. Cortez Masto, unlike Kelly, has not carved out a base of popularity, according to the polls. The final two states to the Senate math are the hardest to figure out. Georgia and Pennsylvania couldn\u2019t be more different in terms of their demographic math, even if they both voted for Biden by slim margins in 2020. Pennsylvania is a Great Lake swing state in which Democrats must win a healthy share of White voters without a college degree. That\u2019s a group that has been running away from Democrats, which is why Hillary Clinton in 2016 became the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988. If border issues play an outsized role in a state like Arizona and a recovering gaming industry are pivotal in Nevada, the big non-inflation story in Pennsylvania is crime. Philadelphia, the most populated city in the state, has seen a jump in its crime rate over the last few years. Republican Mehmet Oz has used the crime issue to close what was once a large advantage for Democrat John Fetterman in the Senate race. Fetterman, though, has seemed to persevere, despite a stroke that left him off the trail for a period of time. He continues to nurse a small lead in the area of 2 to 3 points. The Times had Fetterman up 6 points, though much of that polling was taken before a debate last week that many viewed as a weak one for him. Additionally, Republicans have tended to outperform their final polling the last few cycles. Oz, for his part, has had a negative net favorability rating throughout the campaign, as he\u2019s had to fight off charges of being a carpetbagger. While Pennsylvania (and Arizona and Nevada) may take a while to project, we should know who wins them by the end of November. That may not be the case in Georgia. Georgia is unique amongst the four in that the candidate with the most votes needs a majority to win. Otherwise, there will be a runoff in December. At this point, a runoff seems quite plausible. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are in a tight race. Neither one of them is anywhere close to 50% in the average of polls, with Libertarian Chase Oliver pulling around 3% of the vote. The potential for a runoff isn\u2019t the only thing that makes Georgia unique. The Peach State has, by far, the largest Black population of any of these pivotal races. Democrats have made a comeback in this deep Southern state because of a growing Black population, and the movement to Democrats among White college educated voters in the Atlanta area. Georgia, though, is the most Republican of any of the aforementioned states. Biden won it by the smallest margin of any state he won in 2020. In January 2021 runoffs, Warnock along with Sen. Jon Ossoff became the first two Democrats to win Senate elections in Georgia in a generation. Warnock\u2019s 2021 election was a special one to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, which is why he\u2019s up for reelection so soon. Ultimately, Georgia may come down to the same thing that is occurring in most swing states this year. A Republican candidate in Walker who sports a net negative favorability rating with the backdrop of a deeply unpopular President. Whichever matters most to the rare swing voter will probably decide the winner in Georgia and who wins control of the Senate.",

            "article_content": "After House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested last week that Republicans might pull back funding for Ukraine next year if they take the majority, the GOP leader has worked behind the scenes to reassure national security leaders in his conference that he wasn\u2019t planning to abandon Ukraine aid and was just calling for greater oversight of any federal dollars, sources told CNN. McCarthy told key Republican national security committee members \u2013 some of whom reached out to McCarthy \u2013 that his comments that Ukraine wouldn\u2019t get a \u201cblank check\u201d in a Republican majority were being taken out of context, the sources said. Rather, McCarthy told his members he was simply saying that a GOP-led House would not automatically rubber-stamp a request from the administration for additional Ukraine aid. \u201cMcCarthy was not saying, \u2018We wouldn\u2019t spend money.\u2019 McCarthy was saying, \u2018We\u2019re gonna be accountable to the taxpayer for every dollar we spend,\u2019\u201d one GOP lawmaker familiar with McCarthy\u2019s thinking told CNN. \u201cA \u2018blank check\u2019 means that people get whatever they ask for. What we\u2019re saying is there\u2019s going to be some thought, there\u2019s going to be accountability, and taxpayer dollars are going to be used appropriately.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s effort to soothe the House\u2019s senior defense hawks, which has not been previously reported, underscores the fine line the aspiring speaker is walking on foreign policy as the war in Ukraine appears poised to grind into a second year. But it also offers a preview of the types of policy and political battles to come between the establishment and pro-Trump wings of the GOP, presenting a tricky balancing act \u2014 and potential headaches \u2014 for Republican leaders in a House majority. 'People are furious': Jayapal withdraws letter on Ukraine policy amid Democratic anger Ukraine has led to messy politics for Democrats as well. On Monday, Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state abruptly withdrew a letter pushing the Biden administration to pursue diplomacy in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, an about-face following furious internal backlash from Democrats. GOP sources told CNN they believe that only a small faction of Republican lawmakers \u2014\u202fthe midterm elections will determine how many \u2014 are opposed to funding Ukraine\u2019s battlefield efforts. What\u2019s more likely to likely face cuts under a GOP majority, sources said, is the economic assistance and other non-military aid going to Ukraine, like the aid money going to the United Nations to help Ukraine rebuild its country and the money going to USAID to support Ukraine\u2019s budget. If Republicans win back the House, GOP sources say they are likely to ramp up overall oversight of the billions of dollars in aid going to Ukraine, such as examining end-use tracking of weapons. CNN has previously reported that the Biden administration doesn\u2019t have perfect visibility into how or where US-provided weapons are used once they cross the border into Ukraine. Still, senior congressional Republicans who support robustly funding Ukraine\u2019s war are watching warily as some more isolationist-minded colleagues have become increasingly vocal in recent weeks that they will heavily scrutinize \u2013 if not outright oppose \u2013 US money for Ukraine. Fifty-seven Republicans in the House and 11 in the Senate voted against the $40 billion Ukraine aid bill in May. Some vocal GOP opponents like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Chip Roy of Texas jumped on McCarthy\u2019s recent comments to argue that a Republican majority should scale back aid to Ukraine. Putin has been watching and waiting for this moment in Washington The anti-aid crowd also has influential voices like Fox\u2019s Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump Jr. who have advocated for cutting off aid to Ukraine altogether. \u201cThey\u2019re strong. Amongst Republicans, I call it the \u2018Tucker Carlson\u2019 effect,\u201d the lawmaker said of House GOP skeptics. \u201cI love Tucker on other issues, but he\u2019s wrong on this. He\u2019s listening to Russia disinformation. And he\u2019s creating problems for us in our districts.\u201d McCarthy can\u2019t afford to alienate or ignore the noisy skeptics in his conference who have raised concerns about indefinitely funding Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia \u2013 whose votes he will need to become speaker, especially if Republicans win a narrow majority. \u201cMcCarthy cracked the door open here. He is leaning more towards our direction of pulling back. You also have Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham banging the drum on this,\u201d said a source familiar with the ongoing discussions about Ukraine aid who favors tighter purse strings. A McCarthy spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Last week, McCarthy told Punchbowl News, \u201cI think people are going to be sitting in a recession, and they\u2019re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine.\u201d The comments prompted frantic outreach on Capitol Hill from Ukrainians and European allies alike, sources told CNN, intensifying long-running concerns that a Republican majority in Congress threatens to hamper US support for Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia. They also led some GOP national security hawks to begin planning a campaign for after the midterm election to ensure that the US doesn\u2019t abandon Ukraine. That includes preparing a combination of education for their new and skeptical colleagues as well as examining ways to increase oversight of where the money and weapons are going inside Ukraine. To help convince skeptics, Republicans are looking to tap former Trump administration national security leaders as expert voices \u2013 rather than Biden administration officials. Some of the voices that Republicans are considering bringing in to speak to new members include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger, sources said. \u201cThey need to hear from people they trust. The administration isn\u2019t necessarily the best messenger for this,\u201d said one GOP congressional aide. They\u2019re also planning to hold briefings from Republican think tanks with conservative bona fides like the Heritage Foundation, congressional trips to the region and direct engagement with Ukrainian and European officials as part of an education campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think the issue is one of lack of support of aid from Ukraine. It\u2019s a signaling that Republicans do things differently,\u201d Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican in line to chair the House Intelligence Committee next year, said in an interview with CNN. Turner, who just returned from a bipartisan congressional meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine, argued the bills that Democrats passed this year \u2013 such as a $40 billion aid package in May \u2013 included extraneous funding that he criticized as a \u201cbloated bureaucracy,\u201d such as money that went to the UN. \u201cKevin McCarthy supports providing weapons systems to Ukraine to continue to win on the battlefield,\u201d Turner said in a roundtable with reporters on Monday. Despite confidence among GOP hawks that they have the upper hand over the caucus\u2019 more isolationist wing, lawmakers are beginning to lay the groundwork to convince new members in particular that the military support is vital spending. Congressional Democrats on national security committees told CNN that McCarthy\u2019s comments didn\u2019t raise major alarm bells \u2013 yet \u2013 as they still believe there\u2019s significant support for Ukraine among their Republican colleagues. One Democrat noted that Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell is a stalwart supporter of funding Ukraine\u2019s war \u2013 and the Senate often gets its way in funding fights. \u201cThere\u2019s the Reagan block and there\u2019s the Trump block. And the Reagan block wants to help,\u201d said another House Democrat who works on national security issues. McCarthy, the Democrat said, was \u201csignaling that he\u2019s going to have resistance and it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d In the House, the pro-Ukraine effort is likely to be led by the \u201cthree Mikes\u201d poised to become committee chairmen: Turner of Ohio on Intelligence, Mike McCaul of Texas on Foreign Affairs, and Mike Rogers of Alabama on Armed Services. Another key voice will be Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, a defense hawk who is expected to become House Appropriations chairwoman in a Republican majority. If he becomes chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, McCaul is considering holding his first hearing next year on Russian war crimes, according to one congressional source, to hammer home the egregiousness of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to give them what they need. The Ukrainians, when we give them what they need, they win,\u201d McCaul said on Bloomberg TV last week. \u201cI do think you have broad bipartisan support for what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, but I think you\u2019ll see if we get the majority, more oversight and accountability in terms of the funding and where the money is going.\u201d The defense hawks are expected to make the case that the war with Russia goes beyond Europe. They argue that the US needs Ukraine to win in order to deter China from invading Taiwan, for instance. One senior Republican noted that Iranian drones now being used on the battlefield show how the war extends far beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders. The Ukrainians are also likely to make their own case directly to Congress. Ukrainian legislators and other top officials have held meetings with their American counterparts since the war began, telling US lawmakers that it is cheaper to invest in Ukrainian defense now than to defend Europe against wide-ranging Russian aggression later. Ukraine skeptics both in Congress and on the campaign trail \u2013 along with influential outside voices \u2013 are preparing to ramp up their own campaign to try to curtail or outright stop the flow of US dollars to Ukraine. Republican criticism of funding Ukraine has largely focused on the high costs of prolonging the war, as well as concerns about corruption in Ukraine and the need to devote more resources to domestic challenges. Earlier this month, the House Freedom Caucus wrote to McCarthy urging him to stand up a special inspector general on US involvement in Ukraine. Greene, a far-right Georgia Republican, posted a video on Twitter last month saying, \u201cThere is a country\u2019s border that he (Biden) cares about and it is not this country\u2019s border, it is Ukraine\u2019s border. I believe our American tax dollars need to be used only for our country while we have so many problems, security crises.\u201d After McCarthy\u2019s comments last week, Rep. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican who is seeking a House leadership post next year, tweeted, \u201cA Republican-led House will put the needs of America first. We cannot continue with unlimited spending for any foreign nation while our people are struggling to get by here at home.\u201d The Senate GOP conference could also soon have new members who have been vocal opposing the aid, such as J.D. Vance, the Senate GOP nominee in Ohio. \u201cI think we\u2019re at the point where we\u2019ve given enough money in Ukraine, I really do,\u201d Vance told local Ohio television station 13abc last month. But McConnell also weighed in last week with a statement urging the Biden administration and US allies to \u201cbe quicker and more proactive to get Ukraine the aid they need\u201d \u2013 comments that were in stark contrast to McCarthy\u2019s statement and a sign that McConnell expects Senate Republicans to continue to support Ukraine\u2019s war. Dan Caldwell, vice president of foreign policy at Stand Together, a conservative non-profit that opposes open-ended spending in Ukraine, said those advocating for scaling back support to Ukraine are also gearing up to make their voices heard with new members in what\u2019s expected to be a Republican-controlled Congress. \u201cDuring the first few weeks of the new Congress, new members will have a lot of people trying to convince them to not keep their campaign promises to oppose interventionist policies in Ukraine,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cOur community will make the argument to these members that not only is pursuing a more realist approach to Ukraine good policy, it is also good politics \u2013 especially considering domestic economic challenges and more important foreign policy priorities in other parts of the world.\u201d The looming fight over Ukraine aid could come even before Republicans take control of Congress next year, as the Biden administration is considering pushing through another major Ukrainian assistance package before the end of 2022, administration officials told CNN. So far this year, Congress has approved more than $65 billion in aid toward Ukraine. While the administration believes that Republicans are unlikely to completely curtail support for Ukraine, they see value in locking in support now before things could get more challenging. \u201cEnd of the year funding in Washington is going to be the wild, wild West of spending, especially if Republicans win the House,\u201d Turner told reporters Monday, adding that Republicans could oppose a bill with extraneous items attached. Regardless of what it can get approved during the lame-duck session, the Biden administration will likely have to come back to Congress at some point next year to ask for money. While there is an acknowledgment that oversight will have to ramp up when reconstruction in Ukraine begins \u2013 which could be needed even before the war ends due to just how much help Ukraine will need \u2013 many congressional aides and administration officials believe that additional layers are not necessary at this time. Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur argued there already is clear accountability when it comes to weapons getting onto the battlefield. \u201cI understand their position to have more accountability. I also have information from (Joint Chiefs Chairman) Gen. (Mark) Milley, who said to me that there is more of an accountability as ever, regarding the help sent to Ukraine, because they even have a barcode system to track basically each shipment which was sent to Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe this is exactly what also Republicans want to hear that yes, there is accountability.\u201d",

            "article_content": "For months, Russian President Vladimir Putin has waited and watched, hoping for a fracturing of the remarkable Washington consensus built by President Joe Biden on the need to do everything it takes to defend democracy in Ukraine. Now, at last, the first cracks may be appearing. There is no sign that the $18 billion US pipeline of military aid that has helped Ukraine drive back Russia\u2019s onslaught is immediately in danger. But the stirrings of political opposition to an endless US role in the war are growing on both sides of the aisle just two weeks before the November midterms. Even the slightest hint of a softening of American resolve could comfort Putin as the Kremlin strongman prepares to inflict a painful winter on Ukrainian civilians and Europeans reliant on Russian gas. 'People are furious': Jayapal withdraws letter on Ukraine policy amid Democratic anger In what can only be described as a political debacle on Tuesday, progressive Democrats published, then withdrew, a letter initially signed in June that called on the White House to match its effort to arm Ukraine with a strong diplomatic effort to engage Russia and seek a ceasefire. This came days after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the possible next speaker, warned that Kyiv could not expect a \u201cblank check\u201d on aid if the GOP is in charge next year. CNN reported Wednesday that the GOP leader was forced into a damage control operation with national security leaders in his conference and insisted he didn\u2019t want to cut aid to Ukraine, but merely to ensure tax-payer dollars were not automatically rubber-stamped for the war. The furor over his remarks, reported by CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona, Kylie Atwood, Jeremy Herb and Katie Bo Lillis, shows the fine line McCarthy will have to walk on the issue if the GOP wins the majority. For example, ex-President Donald Trump, a possible future Republican candidate, has been complaining about the cost of supporting a government locked in a struggle with his hero, Putin, and that he dragged into his first impeachment by using military aid in a coercion scheme. Trump will be a huge influence on any future Republican House majority after the midterms. Ex-President Donald Trump, a possible future Republican candidate, has, meanwhile, been complaining about the cost of supporting a government locked in a struggle with his hero, Putin, and that he dragged into his first impeachment by using military aid in a coercion scheme. It\u2019s clear that a bipartisan consensus for aiding Ukraine still exists in Washington. But the rumblings that Biden\u2019s hardline on Russia may not always enjoy near unanimous support came at an especially sensitive time as the West seeks to discredit Russia\u2019s latest round of nuclear rhetoric \u2013 a warning that Kyiv could use a dirty bomb. The claims have led to high-level talks between US and Russian military chiefs and are widely being interpreted as either more scare tactics or perhaps an attempt by Moscow to create a false flag operation that could be used as a pretext for its own use of weapons of mass destruction. Seeking to highlight US and Western commitment to Ukraine amid the political chatter, Biden delivered a fresh warning on Tuesday against the use of smaller-yield nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine. \u201cLet me just say: Russia would be making an incredibly serious mistake for it to use a tactical nuclear weapon,\u201d Biden told reporters after he was asked whether Russia was preparing to use a dirty bomb. \u201cI\u2019m not guaranteeing you that it\u2019s a false flag operation yet, don\u2019t know, but it would be a serious, serious mistake.\u201d What is a dirty bomb and why is Russia talking about it? The President\u2019s comments were a reminder that the maneuvering in Washington over Ukraine aid is taking place in a critical context, with anxiety still acute over a possible escalation of the war that could spill over into direct US-Russia hostilities and put the world on a disastrous path toward a full-on nuclear escalation. This is why signs of fraying political resolve in the United States, and in some allied nations, are so significant. They could convince Putin that a war of attrition over the winter could sooner or later cause fatigue in the West and therefore weaken Ukraine\u2019s ability to fight. And yet some of the questions raised by those who are cautious about the US stance are relevant and important. A foreign policy operation that lines up the United States against its former Cold War foe and nuclear rival must be constantly evaluated and justified by the President, given the cost and risks. The fact that there is no diplomatic track in the conflict \u2013 Biden has several times mused privately that he doesn\u2019t know what Putin\u2019s \u201coff-ramps\u201d might be \u2013 is worthy of discussion and, potentially, testing in contacts with Moscow. And at a time of raging inflation and economic hardship in the United States, it is incumbent on the administration and its supporters to demonstrate to American taxpayers why a war on the edge of Europe is sucking up billions in public money, even if it\u2019s not as if Ukraine currently has the \u201cblank check\u201d McCarthy mentioned. Liberal Democrats call on Biden to shift Ukraine strategy The risk, though, is that such debates still play into the hands of Putin, who has already demonstrated his capacity to exploit and widen US political divides with his election-meddling scheme in 2016 and the hold he had over Trump, even getting him to denounce US intelligence agencies in a joint news conference. Sooner or later, the political jousting in Washington over how long the US should stay involved in arming Ukraine \u2013 and how much it would cost \u2013 will stumble on the critical questions that could decide the war and could be the motivation for Putin\u2019s frequent escalation of nuclear rhetoric that raises the stakes. Is the West as dedicated as Putin, whose political survival may depend on victory or at least not losing, to prevailing in Ukraine? And is it really willing to enter into a dangerous cycle of escalation that could risk wider nuclear war to do so? It is with these questions lingering that the drama over a letter signed by 30 progressives played out on Tuesday. Most of the members did not endorse releasing the letter this week, and some said they wouldn\u2019t have signed it now given the grave turn the war has taken in recent days. The anger over the letter caused Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, to withdraw the letter, saying it was drafted months ago and released by staff without vetting. The episode did not just threaten to expose vulnerable lawmakers just two weeks before an election in which Democrats increasingly fear they will lose the House. It could give McCarthy cover in a future Congress to argue that opposition to Biden\u2019s multi-billion dollar arms packages is not just a Republican preoccupation. And while the letter was withdrawn, some of its sentiments could boil up again. The letter said that lawmakers were under no illusions about the difficulty in engaging Russia, given its \u201coutrageous and illegal invasion of Ukraine.\u201d But it added: \u201cIf there is a way to end the war while preserving a free and independent Ukraine, it is America\u2019s responsibility to pursue every diplomatic avenue to support such a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.\u201d The problem, however, is that the terms that Russia has set for any peace deal involve locking in its battlefield gains. Now that it has illegally annexed several Ukrainian regions, any preconditions that Putin would set would be impossible for Kyiv to agree to. And rolling back such positions would deal the Russian leader the defeat he is desperate to avoid. So while the idea of talking might seem appealing, it\u2019s not clear how the US could shift the calculus of either side. And Biden has repeatedly insisted he will not negotiate over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s head, as Putin would like. One progressive Democrat, Rep. Ro Khanna of California, told CNN\u2019s Bianna Golodryga that he did not support the decision to pull back the letter. \u201cI think the letter was common sense,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cI support making sure we arm Ukraine and provide arms to Ukraine and continue to fund it, but I also believe that the President, as he said, we are at a risk of nuclear war.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think our counterpart should be talking to Russia? Of course they should to be sure that it doesn\u2019t escalate.\u201d There is also a risk that diplomacy at this stage could offer Putin a prize for the human carnage he perpetrated in Ukraine. \u201cThere is moral and strategic peril in sitting down with Putin too early. It risks legitimizing his crimes and handing over parts of Ukraine to Russia in an agreement that Putin won\u2019t even honor,\u201d Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut wrote in a tweet on Tuesday. \u201cSometimes, a bully must be shown the limits of his power before diplomacy can work.\u201d One thing that the drama over the Democratic letter on Ukraine did achieve was to show that while support for Ukraine is bipartisan, anxiety about the war is too, even if the skeptics are a smaller group so far. The prospect of a House more squarely in Trump\u2019s ideological image after the midterm elections and of more GOP senators who share his \u201cAmerica First\u201d worldview will worry the administration. \u201cI think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they\u2019re not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,\u201d McCarthy said in an interview with Punchbowl News last week, which was seized upon by Democrats. But it did not necessarily mean the California lawmaker was determined to cut off aid. He may simply have been creating some political room for himself in the knowledge of the sensitivity of the issue in his pro-Trump party. In theory, a speaker McCarthy would be able to pass a Ukraine funding bill by using both Republican and Democratic votes. Watch as support for funding Ukraine erodes among Republicans But whether his own position in a fractious GOP conference would allow him to do so is another matter. That\u2019s one reason why there is growing talk in Washington that Democrats might try to pass a mammoth bill during the lame-duck Congress, which they will still control after the midterms even if the GOP wins, to carry Ukraine through next year\u2019s fighting. McCarthy is not the only Republican sounding skeptical notes. Ohio Republican Senate nominee J.D. Vance said he didn\u2019t really care about what happened to Ukraine before the invasion and that the US should worry about the influx across its own southern border. (His comment has been used by Democratic opponent, Rep. Tim Ryan, who is seeking to make inroads among the state\u2019s significant Ukrainian exile community). Vance is one of a new breed of potential GOP senators that could prove more skeptical to aiding Ukraine than the old guard of senior leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and hawkish South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. Similar sentiments to Vance\u2019s are often heard on conservative media. But those opinions usually discount the broader implications of the war in Ukraine. The conflict is so important because it represents more than a territorial spat on the far edges of Europe. It is a fight for democracy itself. If Ukraine falls, Russia will establish the principle that a large authoritarian nation can simply wipe a smaller neighbor off the map. This would have grave consequences in other conflicts \u2013 for example, over Taiwan amid rising concerns China could try to take back the democratic island by force. And a Russian victory in Ukraine could directly threaten America\u2019s NATO allies and bring the US closer to a direct conflict with Russia.

            "article_content": "When former Vice President Mike Pence agreed to appear at an October 21 fundraiser for Derek Schmidt, the Kansas Republican\u2019s campaign expected a positive response. But in the first 24 hours after the invitations went out last week, the campaign raised nearly $100,000 \u2013 a figure that astounded Schmidt\u2019s operation. \u201cIt dropped my jaw to the floor,\u201d said one adviser to Schmidt, who is running against incumbent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. \u201cWe\u2019re well over that now. That\u2019s relatively unheard of for Kansas governor.\u201d Kansas is not the only campaign stop for Pence in the final weeks before Election Day. He plans to stump for Republican candidates across the country, including Washington state, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia. CNN has also learned Pence will join Gov. Brian Kemp on a bus tour across the crucial swing state of Georgia. Throughout the cycle, Pence has proven to be an in-demand surrogate and impressive fundraising draw for GOP candidates. To top members of his political team, Pence\u2019s willingness to help candidates up and down the ballot reflects his \u201cservant\u2019s attitude.\u201d But with an eye toward a possible run for the White House in 2024, the most recent Republican vice president is also enhancing his own political brand. Donors, operatives and other Republicans have noticed. \u201cI think Pence has had a very impressive run in the last six months,\u201d said Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist. \u201cHe\u2019s moved around the country in a lot of the targeted districts, raised money, delivered a positive political message. And I think he\u2019s picked up a bunch of political chits.\u201d   While former President Donald Trump remains the dominant figure within the GOP and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis commands plenty of attention and fundraising prowess, Republicans say Pence has quietly been a reliable presence for the party on the campaign trail. And Pence intends to press this advantage after the midterms, publishing his memoir on November 15, a week after Election Day, and embarking on a busy book tour. And his political team continues to grow, with around two dozen staffers occupying office space in Washington. \u201cHe\u2019s putting together the building blocks to analyze if he has what it takes to run after November,\u201d Reed added. Pence hinted at his own ambitions on Wednesday, during an event at Georgetown University, when asked if he would support Trump as the Republican nominee in 2024. \u201cWell, there might be somebody else I\u2019d prefer more,\u201d he said with a smile. But Pence continues to insist his first priority is electing Republican majorities in Congress and more Republican governors. To that end, the bus tour with Kemp will cap off what has been a busy midterm cycle for the Indiana Republican, including visits to 32 states, primarily to support candidates for governor and the US House, but also a handful of Senate hopefuls. According to a person close to Pence, he\u2019s raised more than $10 million for GOP candidates this cycle, including six-figure hauls each for Kemp in Georgia and Lee Zeldin, who is running for governor of New York. At a recent fundraiser to support California House candidate Scott Baugh, Pence helped rake in half a million dollars in a key targeted race. And at a time when Republicans are divided on everything from policy emphasis to what role Trump should play in the party\u2019s future, Pence has been broadly accepting of candidates from all sides of the divide. He has campaigned for everyone from the MAGA-aligned Senate candidate Blake Masters of Arizona to California Rep. David Valadao, who voted to impeach Trump. Republican campaigns who have brought him in have also told CNN that Pence is a willing and relatively drama-free surrogate, especially when compared to other big-name figures in the party. They say Pence is willing to do whatever a candidate needs \u2013 rallies, smaller events, fundraising receptions \u2013 without asking for much from the campaigns, which, in competitive House races, are often strapped for cash and have relatively inexperienced staff. \u201cHe has been very low maintenance,\u201d said the Schmidt adviser. \u201cWhen [Virginia Gov. Glenn] Youngkin and DeSantis came to town, it was their show. This is a bit more deferential.\u201d That approach has helped Pence win and maintain friendships across the spectrum of the party and cultivated for him a reputation as a party-builder during the Biden administration. More than one Republican who spoke to CNN referred to Pence as a \u201cbridge\u201d \u2013 not just across wings of the party but also between the party\u2019s Reaganite past to its more populist present. \u201cUnless you\u2019re a die-hard President Trump supporter that has accepted the conspiracy theories around the election, I think Pence is a bridge to the different elements of our party right now,\u201d said one GOP operative working on House races this cycle. The question remains whether Republican primary voters are seeking a consensus-building elder statesmen in their 2024 nominee for president \u2013 or whether the confrontational style of the current leading contenders for the nomination will prevail. Polling so far suggests Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have the edge. A Siena College poll this month found Trump with 47% support among likely GOP primary voters, with DeSantis at 28%. Pence came in a distant third at 9%. Underlying these numbers is the persistent and potentially permanent break between Pence and his former running mate in the aftermath of January 6, 2021. Pence\u2019s refusal to delay the counting of electoral votes was a pivot point in his political career, and the ambitious Republican has sought to manage carefully his approach to the legal and political fallout of his stand against Trump. For his first several months out of office, Pence declined to speak extensively about January 6 or his role in resisting Trump. In public remarks, he tended to tout the accomplishments of the \u201cTrump-Pence administration\u201d \u2013 a formulation he continues to use \u2013 and would only say that he Trump did not \u201csee eye-to-eye\u201d about the 2020 election. That began to change last year, as Trump continued to make his own statements castigating Pence\u2019s inaction. In June 2021, Pence called Trump\u2019s scheme to overturn the election \u201cun-American.\u201d And in April of this year, in a speech before a conservative legal organization in Florida, Pence declared that Trump was \u201cwrong\u201d to try to delay the counting. \u201cUnder the Constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election, and (Vice President) Kamala Harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024,\u201d Pence said. Those comments won Pence the private plaudits of Republican donors and elected officials, a sign that among the party\u2019s leadership class there is a hunger for moving beyond Trump\u2019s focus. Pence has also registered his resistance to Trump on this subject in his political activity, most notably in some key primary fights earlier this year. He supported and campaigned for Kemp in Georgia, for instance, against David Perdue, the former US senator backed by Trump. The former President was vocally opposed to Kemp, who, like Pence, defied Trump\u2019s demands to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Pence even rallied with Kemp the day before the governor defeated Perdue overwhelmingly in the May 24 primary. But in other instances, Pence\u2019s preferred candidate fell short. In Arizona, most notably, Pence supported Karrin Taylor Robson in the gubernatorial primary against Trump\u2019s preference, Kari Lake. Lake, based much of her campaign on her false claims the 2020 election was stolen in Arizona, won the primary over Taylor Robson, who was better funded and also the choice of the GOP establishment. Many Republicans are skeptical Pence\u2019s apparent popularity with the party\u2019s leadership class translates to much interest among GOP voters themselves. \u201cHe gets a camera out at an event, his people are all looking to raise money. You give the donors something for their investment. He\u2019s a vice president,\u201d said one GOP operative, when asked about what Pence brings as a surrogate. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a big help with messaging or turning out the base.\u201d Beyond trying to elect Republicans this fall, Pence has also sought to play a role in shaping policy and ideological direction of the GOP. His chief vehicle has been Advancing American Freedom, a 501c(4) group that has developed a \u201cFreedom Agenda\u201d that advisers say they hope will influence what they expect to be a Republican majority in the House and possibly the Senate. The Freedom Agenda\u2019s list of policy proposals, which the group released in March of this year and which Pence spoke about in an address at the conservative Heritage Foundation earlier this week, is a synthesis of familiar Reagan-era ideas embracing limited government, social conservatism and free enterprise with some of the more populist ideas that animated GOP voters during the Trump era \u2013 such as finishing the border wall and embracing a more aggressive trade policy to counter China. Pence on whether he'd vote for Trump in 2024: 'There might be somebody else I'd prefer more' But buried in Pence\u2019s proto-presidential platform are some corrections to what traditional conservatives might consider the excesses or aberrations of MAGA populism. Chief among these is on foreign policy, where Pence has pushed back against opposition within some conservative spaces to the American funding of the Ukrainian military in the war with Russia. This week, as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested to Punchbowl News that a Republican majority might resist a \u201cblank check\u201d to fund Ukraine, Pence called on the United States to stay the current course. \u201cI believe as we stand here today, as the arsenal of democracy, we must continue to provide Ukraine with the resources to defend themselves,\u201d Pence said in his October 19 speech at Heritage. Pence added that \u201cthere can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists to Putin. There is only room in this movement for champions of freedom.\u201d Some in the traditional conservative wing of the party say there remains a desire for that more familiar view within the GOP \u2013 and that Pence is well-positioned to take on the mantle of a full-spectrum conservative. \u201cThere are some conservatives and Republicans who think Ronald Reagan is in the past,\u201d said Art Pope, a donor to Pence\u2019s Advancing American Freedom group. \u201cVice President Pence wants to bridge that past, and he\u2019s uniquely positioned to be the messenger.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s a good time to be Marjorie Taylor Greene right about now. As Republicans appear to have the momentum (again) in the fight for House control, Greene is growing more and more confident in her position within the party. \u201cI think that to be the best speaker of the House and to please the base, he\u2019s going to give me a lot of power and a lot of leeway,\u201d Greene told The New York Times Magazine\u2019s Robert Draper of House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t, they\u2019re going to be very unhappy about it.\u201d Which sounds a whole lot like a threat! Except it\u2019s not, according to Greene. \u201cThat\u2019s not in any way a threat at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that\u2019s reality.\u201d And Greene\u2019s boasting of the role she would play in a Republican-controlled House comes as Rolling Stone reported that the Georgia Republican could be in the mix for a role in a second Trump administration. It\u2019s a stark reversal for Greene, who appeared to be a pariah after just a few months in office last year.   In February 2021, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments in the wake of revelations of a series of incendiary and violent statements she had made in the past, including embracing the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. At that point, it seemed as though Greene would drift into irrelevancy \u2013 sidelined from doing much more than forcing occasional time-wasting votes of the full House that angered Republicans as much as Democrats. That has not happened. Instead, over the past year-plus, Greene has grown more and more powerful \u2013 aligning herself firmly with the Trumpist base of the GOP and using her popularity on social media to stay relevant. (Her personal Twitter account was permanently suspended at the beginning of the year for spreading misinformation about Covid-19, but she still has more than 1.1 million followers on her official account.) She has also demonstrated a fundraising prowess literally unheard of outside of party leaders in the past. From the beginning of 2021 through September 30, 2022, Greene had raised $11.6 million for her non-competitive reelection bid in a safe GOP seat. As it\u2019s become clearer and clearer that neither Trump nor his most prominent congressional acolytes are going anywhere in the Republican Party, Greene has found herself on the receiving end of a charm offensive from McCarthy. Greene was at the public unveiling of the House Republicans\u2019 \u201cCommitment to America\u201d plan in Pennsylvania last month, standing right behind McCarthy in the camera shot. And she made a trip to the southern border with the McCarthy earlier this year. Draper even reported that McCarthy has floated the idea of creating a role in leadership for Greene. She coyly deflected: \u201cI don\u2019t have to have a leadership position. I think I already have one, without having one.\u201d The Point: The last 20 months have been filled with ups and downs for Greene. But there\u2019s no question that, with the midterm election just weeks away, she is at her most powerful right now.",

            "article_content": "Trump administration aides \u201cusurped control of CDC communications and blocked public health officials from providing accurate information about the coronavirus to the American people,\u201d the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, led by Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, said in a report released Monday. In its third wide-ranging investigation on the government response to the coronavirus pandemic, Democratic officials spoke with several senior officials who were at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention including former Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who said the Trump officials blocked the department from conveying information to Americans early on in the pandemic. The subcommittee also spoke to senior officials at the US Department of Health and Human Services during the Trump administration. The 91-page report from the subcommittee utilized interviews with officials to make the case that former President Donald Trump and his team \u201cinstalled political operatives who sought to downplay the seriousness of the pandemic.\u201d In one instance, a senior CDC communications officer, Kate Galatas, told the subcommittee Michael Caputo, a close Trump ally who was appointed as assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, used \u201cbully-ish behavior\u201d that made officials at the CDC \u201cfeel threatened.\u201d Caputo disputed the findings in the report in an interview with CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s false. Donald Trump hired me to communicate the seriousness of the pandemic, that\u2019s what I was hired for, I ran a team of 400 people to do that,\u201d Caputo said in an interview with CNN. Caputo described Galatas as a \u201cproblem employee\u201d and being \u201cvery difficult to manage.\u201d In a response received after this story was published, Galatas defended her testimony before the committee and took exception to Caputo\u2019s characterization. She said her observations about Caputo were based on \u201cemail documentation of his hostile and threatening tone and words.\u201d \u201cI am a career CDC employee with an outstanding performance record,\u201d Galatas wrote, adding, \u201cI stand by my testimony and the work I have done as a communicator and leader at CDC.\u201d The report also contains allegations from Dr. Jay Butler, CDC\u2019s Deputy Director of Infectious Diseases, who claims he was \u201cnot really asked back to do telebriefings\u201d after Caputo was displeased with Butler\u2019s statements, which he allegedly found \u201ctoo alarming.\u201d Caputo also disputed this account in the report. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anybody that they were too alarming,\u201d he said. \u201cI sat through tremendously stressful briefings on a daily basis where we were talking about the deaths.\u201d Caputo slammed the report saying he was never interviewed by the House select subcommittee but made himself available. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say, or how they say it, whether it\u2019s in a political document written pre-election by the Democrats, which I have zero respect for, or whether it\u2019s in other fashions,\u201d he said. Redfield also told the committee during his interview that administration officials \u201ccompromised\u201d the CDC\u2019s Covid-19 guidance documents on a few occasions. The subcommittee report said Redfield told them the process \u201cgot complicated\u201d to edit these documents and said the process gave him \u201cPTSD.\u201d Another official Dr. Christine Casey, editor of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) series told the committee the process with the Trump administration was \u201chighly unusual.\u201d The committee also wrote in its investigation that Trump administration officials in HHS attempted to influence the CDC\u2019s scientific reports on the Covid-19 pandemic in the time period of May to mid-September 2020, editing the content or blocking the publication of at least 19 different reports that they believed could have been harmful to Trump. The report also stated HHS political appointees were successful in \u201caltering or delaying the release of at least five scientific reports, as well as pressuring CDC to change the editorial process of the MMWR.\u201d The subcommittee detailed that the affected reports were primarily published in the MMWR, the CDC\u2019s flagship publication, but HHS officials also interfered with at least one Health Alert Network advisory providing urgent public health information to clinicians. \u201cHHS officials also took unprecedented steps to insert political appointees into the publication process and rebut CDC\u2019s scientific reports, including drafting op-eds and other public messaging designed to directly counteract CDC\u2019s findings,\u201d the report stated. In another instance early in the pandemic, CDC officials told the committee they believed Trump officials exploited CDC\u2019s Title 42 authority to close the border. Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC\u2019s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, told the committee the document to close the border \u201cwas not drafted by me or my team,\u201d but was \u201chanded to us.\u201d Cetron added he \u201cexcused\u201d himself from working on the document. It was signed by Redfield. \u201cThe Select Subcommittee\u2019s investigation has shown that the previous administration engaged in an unprecedented campaign of political interference in the federal government\u2019s pandemic response, which undermined public health to benefit the former president\u2019s political goals,\u201d Clyburn said in a statement. \u201cAs today\u2019s report shows, President Trump and his top aides repeatedly attacked CDC scientists, compromised the agency\u2019s public health guidance, and suppressed scientific reports in an effort to downplay the seriousness of the coronavirus.\u201d He added: \u201cThis prioritization of politics, contempt for science, and refusal to follow the advice of public health experts harmed the nation\u2019s ability to respond effectively to the coronavirus crisis and put Americans at risk.  As we continue to recover from the coronavirus crisis, we must also continue to work to safeguard scientific integrity and restore the American people\u2019s trust in our public health institutions.\u201d The subcommittee report concluded the \u201cTrump administration\u2019s interference in CDC\u2019s efforts to respond to the pandemic and attacks against CDC scientists reflected a larger pattern of hostility that ultimately impacted a broad swath of public health officials and agencies.\u201d The report is the third in a series by the select subcommittee, with the first having detailed how the Trump administration worked to undermine the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic by blocking officials from speaking publicly and the second report alleging how the Trump administration waged a \u201ccrusade\u201d against the US Food and Drug Administration.

            "article_content": "Democratic nominees for governor are facing the stiffest competition this year as the party tries to hold on to its gains from the \u201cblue wave\u201d of 2018, even though Republicans are defending more governorships in November. Democrats hold 16 of the 36 gubernatorial seats on the ballot, including in key states like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Events of the past two years have brought to the fore the power of governors, who have played decisive roles in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, the aftermath of former President Donald Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020 and new clashes over the future of abortion rights following the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Gubernatorial races are on the ballot in the five states that flipped from Trump in 2016 to now-President Joe Biden four years later. Those contests, all but one of which feature Trump-backed GOP nominees will test of the strength of the former President\u2019s movement and his ability to boost his picks in a general election. Trump campaigns for Arizona election deniers in a state that will test his power in 2022 and beyond Meanwhile, Republican incumbents in states such as Florida and Texas could be using their reelection campaigns as possible jumping-off points for future presidential bids. The 2022 races are also expected to mark the end of an era in states such as Maryland and Massachusetts, where two-term moderate Republican governors are on their way out \u2013 one via term limits, the other facing dissent within his own party \u2013 with Democrats poised to replace them. As the campaign hits the home stretch, these are the 10 states \u2013 eight where Democrats currently hold the governorship \u2013 with the most consequential contests on the ballot. The Grand Canyon State became ground zero for Trump\u2019s 2020 election conspiracy theories after voters there narrowly backed Biden and Trump-aligned state lawmakers later forced a deeply flawed partisan ballot review in Maricopa County that ultimately did not alter the outcome. But that controversy has lingered, with Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake echoing Trump\u2019s falsehoods that the 2020 election was \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cstolen.\u201d She has also stated that she would not have certified the 2020 election results in Arizona. Lake\u2019s Democratic opponent, Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who defended the state\u2019s election systems against the baseless fraud accusations, has cast the former news anchor as a dangerous threat to democracy. Lake is focusing on her economic agenda in the campaign\u2019s final weeks and on her plans to address increased migration across the border \u2013 including a promise to declare an \u201cinvasion\u201d at the border to give the state greater power to address the issue. She also has accused Hobbs of cowardice for refusing to debate her. Hobbs has centered her campaign on abortion, arguing that her GOP opponent\u2019s extreme positions would endanger Arizona women. The Hobbs-Lake race is one of five gubernatorial contests this cycle in which both major-party nominees are women. Up until this year, there had only been four such matchups in US history. Democrat Laura Kelly seized on voter antipathy for state and national Republicans in 2018 to become governor of reliably red Kansas. Four years later, it may be anger aimed at her own party that dooms her reelection bid. Kelly faces Republican state Attorney General Derek Schmidt in a state Trump won by 15 points in 2020. Schmidt has not impressed party officials with his campaign or his fundraising \u2013 Kelly raised over $1.5 million from January to July, while her GOP opponent only brought in around $700,000 in that time frame. But Republicans are hopeful that Schmidt will benefit from the state\u2019s natural political tilt, which they\u2019re seizing on by tying Kelly to Biden at every turn. Democrats got a boost this summer when a turnout surge helped defeat a ballot measure that would have allowed lawmakers to ban abortion in the state. The victory \u2013 with the \u201cno\u201d vote carrying nearly 60% of the vote \u2013 invigorated Kansas Democrats and seemingly Kelly\u2019s reelection chances. But Kelly has not exactly seized on abortion as an issue in her bid for a second term. On the campaign trail, she has largely focused on speaking about the economy, education and tax cuts, three more palatable issues for the independent and Republican-leaning voters she will need to defeat Schmidt. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak faces fierce headwinds in a state that has seen some of the nation\u2019s highest inflation rates as well as frustration among blue-collar workers about the pace of the post-pandemic recovery. Many Nevadans in the tourism-reliant state were hit hard by pandemic-era closures and are now grappling with the high cost of gas and groceries. Sisolak\u2019s opponent, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, has the backing of both the GOP establishment and Trump, though the Republican nominee has said he does not agree with the former President\u2019s false claim that the 2020 election was rigged. Lombardo has focused on kitchen table issues, including education and the expansion of school choice. He has blamed Biden and the Democrats for inflation \u2013 and accused the governor of hampering the economic recovery by being overly restrictive with school and business closures during the pandemic. Sisolak has defended his actions as necessary to save lives, but he has also attempted to distance himself from the unpopular President. The Democrat has also pounded Lombardo for a series of inconsistent statements on abortion, which is protected up to 24 weeks under Nevada law. Sisolak has faulted his opponent for an uptick in crime in Clark County, home to Las Vegas. At a recent debate, Lombardo said that crime went down for six years of his tenure as sheriff but acknowledged it has increased in the past two years \u2013 which he blamed on \u201csoft on crime\u201d policies advanced by the governor and Democratic lawmakers. An unpredictably close race between three well-funded women could culminate in Oregon electing its first Republican governor in 40 years. Democrat Tina Kotek, the longest-serving state House Speaker in Oregon history, started out as the favorite to replace term-limited Gov. Kate Brown in the blue-leaning state. But independent candidate Betsy Johnson has proved to be a formidable contender who Democrats fear could act as a spoiler in the race. A former Democratic state senator with two decades of legislative experience, Johnson has powerful allies in the business community who have made it possible for her to outraise her opponents. Johnson \u2013 a gun rights advocate who relishes the fact that she is being attacked by the \u201cwoke left\u201d and the \u201cradical right\u201d \u2013 has blamed liberal Democratic policies for trash-lined streets and tent cities, as the state struggles with homelessness. Johnson\u2019s candidacy has created a path for Republican Christine Drazan, the former state House minority leader, who is promising to bring \u201cbalance\u201d back to Oregon while charging that all-Democratic control over the past decade has failed to hold the governor and the Legislature \u201cto account.\u201d Biden made a recent foray to the state to offer Kotek a fundraising assist. Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 bid for reelection in one of the nation\u2019s most competitive states could hinge on what\u2019s most important to voters: abortion rights, which the Democrat has made his top focus in recent weeks, or the economy, which could benefit his Republican challenger, businessman Tim Michels. Evers recently called the state\u2019s GOP-led legislature into a special session, urging lawmakers to allow a Michigan-style referendum to undo the state\u2019s 1849 law that bans abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. But Republicans gaveled in and out of session within 30 seconds, ignoring Evers\u2019 calls. Michels, who won the GOP nomination in August buoyed by a Trump endorsement, has focused his campaign on crime and inflation. Republicans are blaming Evers for a 70% increase in homicides in Wisconsin from 2019 to 2021, and Michels has also criticized the governor\u2019s push to cut the state\u2019s prison population. Wisconsin\u2019s elections have long been hard-fought: Biden defeated Trump there by about 20,000 votes out of more than 3.2 million cast in 2020, four years after Trump carried the state by a similar margin. Evers narrowly unseated GOP Gov. Scott Walker in 2018 but he faces a decidedly different political climate this year. As does his No. 2, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is challenging Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in one of the nation\u2019s most competitive and expensive contests. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has made her support for abortion rights the centerpiece of her bid for a second term against Republican Tudor Dixon, a conservative commentator. Whitmer has positioned herself as the last line of defense for abortion rights in the state. She sued to block Michigan\u2019s 1931 ban from taking effect after the Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion rights protections in June. She is also backing a Michigan ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state\u2019s constitution. Dixon won a wide-open GOP primary in August, benefiting from the financial backing of the family of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and a late endorsement from  Trump. She has embraced Trump\u2019s lies about fraud in the 2020 election. In recent weeks, Dixon has sought to shift the focus of the race from abortion to other cultural issues. She has proposed a measure that would ban transgender girls from competing in sports with the gender they identify with, as well as one modeled after a Florida law, which critics have dubbed \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay,\u201d that bans discussion of gender and sexuality issues with younger students in classrooms. Dixon has also made implicit acknowledgements that the electorate is more closely aligned with Whitmer\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cYou can vote for Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s position without having to vote for Gretchen Whitmer again,\u201d she told reporters recently, citing the abortion ballot measure. On paper, the New Mexico governor\u2019s race should not be competitive: Biden carried the state by double digits in 2020. But if there is a red wave, Republicans hope former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti may be able to unseat incumbent Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a former congresswoman seeking her second term in office. Ronchetti has beaten expectations before. In 2020, as the GOP nominee for Senate, he outran Trump at the top of the ticket, losing by a closer-than-expected 6 points to Democrat Ben Ray Lujan (a distant relative of the governor). In his bid for governor, Ronchetti has attempted to distance himself from the former President \u2013 including by acknowledging that Biden won the 2020 election. He won a five-way GOP primary in June, finishing comfortably ahead of an opponent who had questioned his Republican credentials. Ronchetti\u2019s campaign has focused on crime \u2013 including one ad that a CNN fact check determined was deceptive \u2013 and the decision to stop in-person schooling during the coronavirus pandemic. Lujan Grisham has cast herself as someone who has had to make tough decisions while panning her opponent\u2019s lack of political experience. These contours of the race were clear in their first debate last month. \u201cThere has to be a change here \u2014 she hasn\u2019t taken crime seriously,\u201d Ronchetti said during the debate. \u201cBold words from someone who\u2019s never even been to a legislative session,\u201d Lujan Grisham responded. Less than a month before the election, Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro is enjoying a big lead in the polls \u2013 and in fundraising \u2013 over Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a hard-line conservative who led GOP efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s 2020 victory in the commonwealth. Shapiro is a popular figure who, should he win as expected in November, will be on the radar of national Democrats thinking ahead to the party\u2019s next open presidential primary. Until then, though, his focus will be on defeating Mastriano, who is supported by Trump and chartered buses to Washington ahead of the former President\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021. (Mastriano says he never entered the US Capitol and has not been charged with any crimes.) Like a handful of other contests on this list, Pennsylvania is particularly important to Democrats because the state legislature is controlled by Republicans. And with abortion rights now resting with the states, a GOP governing trifecta could move forward with a ban or severe restrictions on the procedure. Mastriano has said he favors a total ban, with no exceptions. Abortion is currently legal in Pennsylvania, up to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, a standard Shapiro has vowed to support and uphold. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp faces Democrat Stacey Abrams in a rematch of their showdown four years ago. While the race remains competitive, Kemp finds himself in a better position than 2018, when Abrams lost by about 54,000 votes out of nearly 4 million cast. Coming after nearly two decades of GOP dominance in Georgia, Kemp\u2019s slim victory was a sign that the state was up for grabs. Two years later, Georgia narrowly voted blue in the presidential election for the first time since 1992 while Democrats flipped both US Senate seats in runoffs, in no small part due to Abrams\u2019s efforts to organize and mobilize minority and progressive voters in the Peach State. Kemp drew Trump\u2019s ire in 2020 when he rebuffed his efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia. But that stance earned Kemp an independent reputation, aided by a Trump-backed primary challenge that failed to take him down. Kemp remains a reliable conservative and has not shied away from helping enact Republican agenda items, including a far-reaching new elections overhaul and a six-week abortion ban that went into effect with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Abrams, meanwhile, is attempting to use her organizational and financial advantages \u2013 she has outraised Kemp, thanks to a national donor network \u2013 to draw attention to the governor\u2019s most conservative positions, from restricting abortion to opposing Medicaid expansion. But she has struggled to recapture the magic from four years earlier and has consistently run behind Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who is seeking a full six-year term against embattled Republican challenger Herschel Walker. Before he can decide whether to run for president, Gov. Ron DeSantis first faces a reelection test back home. Those close to the Republican governor say he is looking to better Trump\u2019s 3.5-point victory two years ago in Florida \u2013 a symbolic result that would signal DeSantis\u2019 readiness to potentially compete with the former President for the party\u2019s 2024 nomination. Standing in the way is Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor and Democratic congressman whom Democrats have turned to once again try to take down a GOP incumbent. Democrats are not only hoping to slow DeSantis\u2019 rise; they\u2019re desperate to prove that Florida remains a swing state. Crist, though, has been hampered by sluggish fundraising and overall Democratic malaise in the Sunshine State, while DeSantis has broken campaign financing records as he taps into Republican excitement around his political stardom. Crist\u2019s uphill climb was made that much harder by Hurricane Ian, a colossal and deadly storm that forced politics to the back burner as Floridians and their elected leaders \u2013 including DeSantis \u2013 dealt with the aftermath. Both candidates are reemerging on the campaign trail, but Crist lost several weeks when he could ill afford to. It could be back to the future in Maine and Alaska, with two former governors, Republican Paul LePage and independent Bill Walker, respectively looking to unseat incumbents Janet Mills, a Democrat, and Mike Dunleavy, a Republican. The Alaska race will, for the first time, be decided by a ranked-choice vote. Maine, one of the pioneers of that voting system, does not use it in general elections for governor, so the winner only needs a plurality for victory. There isn\u2019t much drama around the electoral outcomes in the blue states of Massachusetts, Maryland and New York. The GOP nominees are all closely aligned with Trump \u2013 a good formula for winning a primary, but likely a losing proposition in a general election. In New York, Republicans\u2019 two-decade-long statewide losing streak \u2013 the longest in the country \u2013 appears poised to continue, with Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who ascended to the top job following Andrew Cuomo\u2019s resignation last year, favored over US Rep. Lee Zeldin. In Maryland, state Del. Dan Cox won the GOP nomination over a candidate endorsed by term-limited Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. He\u2019s floundered since, with Democrat Wes Moore poised to make history as the state\u2019s first Black governor. It\u2019s a similar story in Massachusetts, where popular GOP Gov. Charlie Baker decided against a run for a third term amid backlash from conservative Republicans, who ended up nominating former state Rep. Geoff Diehl. State Attorney General Maura Healey, who would make history as the commonwealth\u2019s first elected female governor and the first out lesbian governor in the US, is the overwhelming favorite to reclaim the corner office for Democrats. Another woman with a chance to make history in November is Arkansas Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a former press secretary in the Trump White House and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee. Sanders is heavily favored to become the first female governor of the deep-red state. There are also a handful of states that, while their results might not be in much doubt, incumbent governors, like DeSantis in Florida, will be keeping a close eye on their margins of victory as they look ahead to potential presidential bids, in 2024 or beyond. In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is in a contentious race with Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke. The former El Paso congressman hasn\u2019t caught fire like he did in his near-miss 2018 Senate run but remains an estimable opponent. A big win for Abbott could stoke his ambitions. The same could go for GOP Govs. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who may be facing a closer-than-expected reelection race but remains favored in a state that last elected a Democratic governor in 1974. Among Democrats, Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, Jared Polis of Colorado and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois could all seek to use successful reelection bids next month as a springboard to higher office.",

            "article_content": "In Georgia\u2019s already contentious Senate race, Friday\u2019s debate between Republican Herschel Walker and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Savannah will provide the highest stakes moment yet. The Senate contest, one of the most competitive in the country and key to winning control of the chamber, has been scrambled in recent days by news reports that Walker, a conservative who supports a full federal abortion ban with no exceptions, allegedly paid for a woman to terminate her pregnancy and then, two years later, encouraged the same woman to have the procedure a second time. Walker has denied the allegations, which have not been independently confirmed by CNN.   With those allegations weighing on the Senate race, Democrats and Republicans alike view the debate as a potentially decisive hour, when both candidates will have a chance to sway the tiny sliver of remaining undecided voters. \u201cBoth candidates know well that this debate could be make or break for the entire election \u2013 the stakes really could not be higher,\u201d Randy Evans, a Republican strategist who co-wrote a guidebook in 2020 on winning political debates, told CNN. Much of the pressure is on Walker, a political newcomer who has never before stood on a debate stage. A poll released this week by Quinnipiac University found Warnock with 52% support among likely voters, compared to 45% for Walker. Friday night\u2019s showdown \u2013 the only debate both candidates agreed to take part in \u2013 could be the Republican\u2019s last chance to speak out, before a primetime audience, about the recent accusations against him. Walker and his campaign have made the debate their priority in the closing weeks of the race, according to multiple sources close to the campaign, with one source saying the candidate has dedicated a significant amount of his time to preparing for his face-off with Warnock. Walker has leaned on top Republicans for advice, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said a second person close to the campaign. He has prepared for the debate by participating in mock question and answer sessions with campaign aides and both Walker and his aides have spent time familiarizing the candidate with Warnock\u2019s past debate performances against then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler during the 2020 Senate race. \u201cWalker just needs to show people he is knowledgeable on the issues and that he cares,\u201d said a third source close to the Walker campaign. \u201cThe reality is with all the attacks that have been launched against Walker, the debate is an opportunity for him to not just do well and maybe meet or exceed expectations but also to reach new voters.\u201d New poll finds Georgia Senate race remains unchanged after allegations about Walker The thinking, the source says, is that voters have been swamped with ads and news stories about Walker\u2019s personal life, so the debate offers an opportunity for the Republican to \u201cshow he is knowledgeable on the issues\u201d and allow him to respond beyond what can be said in 30-second ads. Still, Republicans, including Walker himself, have also sought to lower expectations as he prepares to go toe-to-toe with Warnock, touting the Georgia Democrat\u2019s ability to debate and his career as the high-profile senior pastor at Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church. \u201cI\u2019m not that smart. He\u2019s a preacher. (Warnock) is smart and wears these nice suits. So, he is going to show up and embarrass me at the debate Oct. 14th, and I\u2019m just waiting to show up and I will do my best,\u201d Walker said recently. One of the sources close to Walker\u2019s campaign said Warnock\u2019s experience at the pulpit could be a double-edged sword. The Democrat has an upper hand in public speaking, the source said, but noted that Walker may try to corner his opponent with questions about \u201credemption\u201d and pastoral care should Warnock attempt to go after his character. \u201cHerschel\u2019s debate prep is undoubtedly going to be dramatically different from Warnock\u2019s because Warnock is a very practiced public speaker who has demonstrated already that he has a sharp tongue,\u201d said Evans. Gingrich even invoked Walker\u2019s football career while discussing the debate. \u201cHe had a lot of concussions coming out of football, he suffered PTSD,\u201d the Georgia Republican said. Walker has been open about his struggles with dissociative identity disorder. Democrats closest to Warnock have watched Republicans lower expectations with skepticism. \u201cWalker\u2019s attempts to lower expectations are not fooling anyone in Georgia,\u201d said a Georgia-based Democratic consultant. \u201cGeorgians are not dumb.\u201d Sarafina Chitika, Warnock\u2019s spokesperson, also dismissed the idea that outside Republican advice from the likes of Gingrich and Graham would help once the debate starts. \u201cAt the end of the day, there are going to be two people on the debate stage: Reverend Warnock and Herschel Walker,\u201d Chitika said. \u201cAnd the difference between them could not be more clear.\u201d GOP surrogates rally for Georgia's Herschel Walker in show of unyielding national party support But the fact that Walker has never debated before could work against Democrats, too: Operatives and consultants eager to better prepare Warnock for the stage have little idea what to expect when the former football star steps up to the lectern. With no earlier debate tape to study, Democrats are left largely in the dark. So far, Warnock has shown no interest in attacking Walker for the abortion allegations that have consumed the race in recent days. \u201cThere are a lot of [allegations], I\u2019m not sure which ones you are referring to,\u201d Warnock said on Wednesday when asked about why he wasn\u2019t weighing in more heavily on the Walker allegations. Outside groups supporting Warnock have seized on the Walker drama, however, and Warnock has not denounced the spots blanketing televisions in Georgia. Asked about the debate, Warnock demurred: \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d Whether Walker will seek to litigate personal allegations against Warnock is an open question. A super PAC supporting Walker put out an ad this highlighting a March 2020 incident in which Warnock\u2019s ex-wife, Oul\u00e8ye Ndoye, told police that he ran over her foot with his car. Warnock has denied the allegations and he was not charged, and a police report stated that an officer and medical personnel at the scene did not find any visible signs of injury to Ndoye. It would be a risky attack for Walker. Should he raise the issues for Warnock, Democrats argue, he risks a protracted conversation about his own personal history and the personal allegations around his family and abortion. Like other Republicans in tight Senate contests, Walker is being advised to use the debate stage to highlight links between Warnock and President Joe Biden \u2013 the same Quinnipiac poll that showed Warnock leading also found that 45% of likely voters approve of Biden\u2019s job handling, compared to 53% who disapprove. The Republican is also preparing to question his opponent\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d on promises about taming inflation, securing the border and curbing violent crime. A memo released by the Warnock campaign on Thursday morning said to expect the Democrat to play up his bipartisan legislative record and \u2013 in trying to create some distance from the President \u2013 note that he \u201chas stood up to the Biden Administration to protect jobs at the Savannah Combat Readiness Training Center,\u201d a military facility in the coastal city that faced major funding cuts and potential closure. Warnock has, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis, voted with Biden more than 96% of the time during his nearly two years in office. Why Republicans can't walk away from Herschel Walker The Warnock campaign, as repeatedly stated in the memo, will seek to keep the focus on the senator\u2019s policy positions and hope that any undecided voters are left, \u201cAt the end of the night,\u201d with a clear sense of the \u201cdifference between two candidates who couldn\u2019t be more different\u201d \u2013 a statement, in effect, that suggests they expect Walker to create his own problems on the debate stage. If confronted with allegations about his past, including mental health and domestic violence concerns, Walker is widely expected to keep his focus on the theme of redemption, which his campaign highlighted in a 30-second ad released last week. \u201cHe\u2019s a minister. Has he ever heard of forgiveness?\u201d Walker said at a rally this week. \u201cHas he ever heard of redemption?\u201d Walker\u2019s campaign has kept a tight lid on their debate preparations, choosing to limit prep sessions to his immediate aides while fielding guidance and advice from outside advisers. He speaks frequently with Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee and traveled to the battleground state on Tuesday to campaign for Walker, and his team has been in regular touch with Gingrich, who has participated in his own fair share of debates and helped coach then-candidate Trump through general election debates in 2016. \u201cAbsent a gaffe,\u201d said one of the people close to Walker\u2019s campaign, \u201che\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former congresswoman and 2020 presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard announced on Tuesday that she is leaving the Democratic Party. For Gabbard, the announcement is the culmination of years in which she has been increasingly at odds with the Democratic Party and its policies. \u201cI can no longer remain in today\u2019s Democratic Party. It\u2019s now under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue & stoking anti-white racism, who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms enshrined in our Constitution,\u201d Gabbard said in a video posted to social media. The announcement was made on the first episode of her new podcast, \u201cThe Tulsi Gabbard Show.\u201d Gabbard, who made history by becoming the first American Samoan and practicing Hindu in Congress following her election in 2012, also criticized what she said were Democrats\u2019 \u201copen border\u201d policies and anti-police rhetoric. The former congresswoman, who represented Hawaii\u2019s 2nd district, has long been a unique and occasionally controversial voice in the Democratic Party. As one of the Democratic presidential contenders in the crowded 2020 field, she touted herself as an Iraq War veteran and staked out a distinctly anti-interventionist foreign policy. On the campaign trail, she blamed US intervention in Latin America for creating instability that triggered the surge in migration across the southern US border and was a co-sponsor of several bills aimed at keeping migrant families together at the border. And when Gabbard was running for president, Hillary Clinton suggested in an interview that she was being groomed to run as a third-party candidate and was a favorite of the Russians. Clinton suggested that the person she was talking about was a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d while not naming the Hawaii Democrat. Gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit over the matter that she subsequently dropped in May 2020. Gabbard endorsed Joe Biden after suspending her presidential campaign in 2020, but she has since been a vocal critic of the President and regularly appears on Fox News. \u201cPresident Biden campaigned on a message of unity, healing the partisan divide bringing the country together. He just gave a big speech saying supporters of President (Donald) Trump are the most extremist group in our country and a threat to our democracy. That\u2019s half the country,\u201d she said in her announcement video on Tuesday. Gabbard also faced criticisms earlier this year from local Democrats who voted to condemn her \u201cfor participating in an event that raised funds that will harm Democrats across the country\u201d after she spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference. The former congresswoman did not indicate which party she would be affiliated with moving forward but called on \u201cindependent-minded Democrats\u201d to join her in leaving the Democratic Party.",

            "article_content": "Not many Republican candidates want to talk about abortion in their campaigns, especially in their costly paid television or digital ads. But the few who are taking on the issue are doing so with a familiar message: We aren\u2019t the extremists, Democrats are. It\u2019s a theme playing out across the country, from gubernatorial contests to House and Senate races. While most GOP attack ads focus on issues like the economy, the border and crime, some Republicans have looked to counter Democratic messaging on abortion rights, hoping to cut into what has become a motivating issue for Democrats since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. It can be a difficult case to make. After the Supreme Court ruling ended federal abortion protections, a series of state-enacted abortion restrictions have come into effect, including some that ban abortion outright. These laws, coupled with decades of Republican anti-abortion advocacy, have put the party on the defensive, as polls show abortion rights supporters across the political spectrum energized by the issue and nearly two-thirds of Americans opposed to the high court\u2019s decision. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 In the face of Democratic attacks, some Republicans in blue or swing states say it\u2019s Democrats \u2013 many of whom back minimal restrictions, if any, to abortion \u2013 who are out of step with how Americans feel about abortion. Democrats contend, however, that this is an issue that should be handled between patients and their doctors, not politicians. Zach Nunn, the Republican challenging Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne in Iowa\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, touted in a recent ad how \u201cmost Iowans support common sense limits on abortion\u201d but that his opponent \u201cvotes for the most extreme abortion laws in the world.\u201d Axne has been running ads attacking Nunn for raising his hand during a GOP primary debate when candidates were asked if they supported a policy banning \u201call abortions\u201d with \u201cno exceptions.\u201d Adam Laxalt, the Republican nominee for Senate in Nevada, launched an ad last month pushing back on criticism of his abortion position. \u201cDemocrat politicians have done incredible damage to America, ruining our economy, causing chaos at our border, increasing crime in our cities. They changed our lives. But one thing hasn\u2019t changed: abortion in Nevada,\u201d the spot says. Laxalt, who prior to the Supreme Court ruling called the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision a \u201cjoke,\u201d wrote in an August op-ed that abortion should be decided at the state level. He said it was a \u201ca falsehood that I would support a federal ban on abortion as a U.S. senator\u201d but noted he would support a potential state referendum banning abortion after 13 weeks of pregnancy. His opponent, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, is running an ad saying she will \u201calways fight for a women\u2019s right to make our own health care decisions,\u201d while \u201cAdam Laxalt won\u2019t.\u201d GOP Senate nominee in blue Washington says she supports state law guaranteeing abortion up to fetal viability Republican Senate candidate Tiffany Smiley in Washington state has aired multiple ads expressing her opposition to a federal ban. \u201cPatty Murray has spent millions to paint me as an extremist,\u201d Smiley says of the longtime Democratic senator in one of her spots. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life, but I oppose a federal abortion ban.\u201d Shortly after Roe was overturned, Murray began airing a straight-to-camera ad, in which she says, \u201cIt is a horrifying reality: Extreme politicians across our country, now in charge of the most private health care decisions.\u201d In the month of September, Democratic campaigns and outside groups spent more than $70 million airing 285 unique ads about abortion, according to tracker AdImpact. Republicans, by comparison, spent just $6 million on 23 unique ads about abortion in the same period. Those numbers are even more dramatic since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision in June. Democrats have run more than 470 unique ads about abortion since then, spending more than $130 million, while Republicans have spent $16 million airing about 100 ads. Republican groups, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, have urged their candidates not to allow their opponents to define them on abortion but also not to fight the election solely on that issue. \u201cThe Democrat position is extreme and strident, our position should be based in compassion and reason,\u201d read an NRSC memo sent to GOP Senate campaigns in the wake of the Dobbs decision. The group said candidates should \u201ccall out Democrats\u201d who \u201chold extreme views on abortion that are out of the mainstream.\u201d This is exemplified by the way Joe O\u2019Dea, the Republican nominee for Senate in Colorado, has addressed the issue in his race against Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in a blue-leaning state. In a recent ad, the first-time candidate and businessman touted his outsider credentials \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m an outsider, not a politician\u201d \u2013 and his support for abortion in the early stages of pregnancy \u2013 \u201cFor the first five months, that should be a woman\u2019s decision between her and her doctor.\u201d The ad also featured his daughter, who called her father \u201ca different kind of Republican\u201d and noted that he \u201csupports a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d O\u2019Dea has also hit Bennet for focusing on abortion, suggesting that by doing so he is \u201cnot talking\u201d about issues such as crime and inflation. It\u2019s a fine line to walk for the Republican. Despite O\u2019Dea taking a more moderate stance on abortion, Bennet attacked him in an August spot that featured Colorado women expressing fear about the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The spot also noted O\u2019Dea\u2019s past remarks that he would have voted to confirm the conservative justices who decided the Dobbs case. \u201cIt makes the race for Senate even more important,\u201d a woman says in the ad. (O\u2019Dea has also said he would have voted for Obama nominee Elena Kagan, a liberal justice who dissented in the Dobbs ruling, as he wants to end the \u201cblood sport\u201d over the Supreme Court confirmation process.) Graham's 15-week abortion bill further complicates Republican midterm messaging \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue that you want to be talking about,\u201d Doug Heye, a longtime Republican strategist and former communications director for the Republican National Committee, said of abortion. \u201cNot necessarily because you don\u2019t want to talk about this issue, but because you have three issues to hammer Democrats on \u2013 crime, the economy, the border \u2013 that should be our message all day, every day.\u201d Heye added: \u201cAnything that is not those three issues, you are off message.\u201d A Republican operative who has worked on House races said the decision to run ads on an issue like abortion is simple. \u201cIf it is an issue in the district and it is showing up in your polling, talk about. If it is not an issue that shows up in your polling, talk about issues like the economy that are more advantageous to you,\u201d the operative said. Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s introduction of a bill last month that would ban abortion nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy has complicated matters for some GOP candidates. The South Carolina Republican, who is not up for reelection this year, introduced the legislation because he did not think sidestepping the issue was working for Republicans and wanted to arm them with an actual policy proposal, according to a source familiar with the senator\u2019s thinking. But the move has bolstered Democratic messaging and forced Republicans to decide whether they believe the issue should be left to the states, as many have said since Roe was overturned, or if they back a federal ban. \u201cThe Supreme Court made it clear: This is a Raleigh decision, not a Washington decision,\u201d North Carolina GOP Senate nominee Ted Budd said in a local interview in September. But shortly after making that point, the congressman co-sponsored the House companion bill to Graham\u2019s proposal, which would let elected officials in Washington, and not the North Carolina capital of Raleigh, decide how to regulate abortion.",

            "article_content": "When Donald Trump won the White House \u2013 in stunning fashion \u2013 in 2016, there was a rush to declare him a master strategist. All of his off-color remarks, all of his unorthodox campaign tactics, they were all part of a grander vision that only he, as a master manipulator of people and the press, could see. He was playing three dimensional chess while the rest of us poor schmoes were playing simple old checkers. What became clear as his presidency wore on, however, was that there was no grand blueprint from which Trump was executing a long-term plan. He was, for lack of a better phrase, just doing stuff. That\u2019s the reality that The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman exposed in an interview over the weekend about her new book on Trump. \u201cHe has a handful of moves that he has used forever,\u201d she told CBS News\u2019 John Dickerson. \u201cAnd people tend to impute a ton of strategy to what he\u2019s doing. But really, there are these moves. And it\u2019s the quick lie, it\u2019s the backbiting with one aide versus another, it is the assigning blame to someone else. All of this, again, is about creating a sense of drama, a sense of chaos, and often, John, about keeping the responsibility off him.\u201d That\u2019s exactly right. And it\u2019s always been true. Witness how Trump described his day back in his 1987 book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d: THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cMost people are surprised by the way I work. I play it very loose. I don\u2019t carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. You can\u2019t be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you\u2019ve got too much structure. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops \u2026 I have at least a dozen meetings. The majority occur on the spur of the moment, and few of them last longer than fifteen minutes.\u201d Absolutely nothing has changed since then. Trump is, by nature, someone who makes it up as he goes along. One great example? His border wall. If you go back and read his announcement speech in the summer of 2015, he doesn\u2019t even mention the wall until the latter half of the address. \u201cI would build a great wall \u2013 and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me \u2013 and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\u201d It was two sentences in a very long speech. And Trump didn\u2019t dwell on it. In fact, he rapidly moved off the wall \u2013 telling the crowd next that \u201cnobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody.\u201d The wall then was just one in a laundry list of items that Trump threw out in his initial speeches. But, what he quickly realized was that it was a big applause line. And so he started talking about it more. And more. The best way to think about Trump \u2013 or the way that\u2019s proven most useful to me \u2013 is as a standup comedian. Early in his political career, he was trying out all sorts of different lines to see which one succeeded with the audience. By now, he\u2019s got his patter down; he only uses the material (stolen election, lame stream media, etc.) that he knows are sure-things with the audience. But, those are all tactics. There is no grand strategy beyond keeping people loyal to him at all costs. And, as Haberman notes, ensuring that he never takes the blame for anything bad in his world. So, let\u2019s dispel \u2013 once and for all \u2013 the idea that Trump is somehow always working five moves ahead of the rest of the political world. He\u2019s not. He is, instead, reacting to whatever happens to come his way \u2013 forever churning to the news of the day.",

            "article_content": "As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis stumps for some of this year\u2019s midterm candidates ahead of what looks increasingly like a showdown with former President Donald Trump in 2024, he\u2019s seemed to be more nimble than most on the Trump tightrope. He\u2019s offered a wink and a nod to the election fraud claims that animate the former President\u2019s loyalists while concentrating on base-pleasing stunts like flying migrants to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. DeSantis privately elevates election deniers while publicly staying mum on 2020 But DeSantis has flirted with election conspiracy theories and installed a state elections chief who appeared committed to the aggressive tactics of activists who have embraced those theories, as described in new CNN reporting Monday. All of that underscores just how many GOP leaders still try to appease a base that fervently believes Trump\u2019s myth that he won. There is no evidence of widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential results. DeSantis has carefully skirted the issue in his public comments \u2013 avoiding a definitive declaration of whether he believes Joe Biden was rightfully elected president, but never making that topic central to his message \u2013 while campaigning for midterm candidates who have trumpeted the former President\u2019s election lies. And yet, CNN\u2019s reporting shows how DeSantis is letting the dangerous falsehoods that threaten this country\u2019s democratic institutions flourish inside his administration in a key swing state. The Florida governor elevated Cord Byrd, a Republican state lawmaker who has entertained election conspiracy theories, to be Florida\u2019s secretary of state this spring, CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno reported, and records obtained by CNN show that officials within DeSantis\u2019 administration repeatedly met with Florida activists aligned with Trump lieutenants who sought to overturn the 2020 presidential results, including one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers, Cleta Mitchell.   Shortly before taking the job as the state\u2019s elections chief, Byrd addressed a gathering of activists in Orlando who embraced Trump\u2019s election theories, telling them they were going to be \u201cour army on the ground\u201d monitoring local election supervisors \u201cto ensure that they\u2019re doing their job right,\u201d according to leaked recordings obtained by CNN. When DeSantis addressed the same group \u2013 the Orlando summit organized by the Conservative Partnership Institute \u2013 he echoed flimsy concerns that Trump has raised about the way elections are run in Georgia, a state the former President narrowly lost where efforts to overturn the results are now the subject of a grand jury investigation. That unwillingness of GOP leaders to challenge Trump\u2019s election mirage comes as the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has meticulously unraveled how Trump pushed his election lies despite being told repeatedly that his claims were false \u2013 essentially punctuating the conclusion of the courts, which had tossed out dozens of attempts by Trump\u2019s team to challenge the 2020 results. New evidence about the mindset of Trump and his closest allies before the 2020 election emerged on Monday. CNN obtained footage provided by a Danish documentary film crew that shows Roger Stone, a close confidante of Trump, arguing on November 1, 2020, that Trump should claim victory on election night even when the result is still \u201cup in the air.\u201d \u201cF**k the voting, let\u2019s get right to the violence,\u201d Stone said in a separate clip filmed before the election that was also obtained by CNN. The filmmakers have shared the footage with the House January 6 committee. Stone disputed the authenticity of the footage in a statement to CNN. And yet, even a potentially formidable Trump rival like DeSantis \u2013 who faces reelection this fall but is already the biggest name in the GOP outside of the former President \u2013 apparently has calculated that the best strategy for his political ascent is to allow Trump\u2019s misinformation about the 2020 election to remain unchallenged. It\u2019s a dangerous strategy that may well throw future elections into chaos with Trump-backed candidates now in the running for jobs that would put them in charge of critical states\u2019 election infrastructure. But it\u2019s still not clear whether voters are as focused on the threats to the election apparatus as they are to other issues like inflation and abortion rights, which seemingly have a more immediate impact on their lives. The general election in November will serve as the first big test of this Trump-era GOP strategy \u2013 and whether the party\u2019s tolerance for or, in some cases, elevation of election deniers in primaries will repel independents and moderate Republicans who don\u2019t have patience for Trump\u2019s obsession with the last election. The former President has complicated his party\u2019s chances of retaking the US House, Senate and a number of governors\u2019 mansions around the country by hand-selecting candidates who were the most vociferous defenders of his baseless theories about 2020 election fraud. His endorsement helped push many of them across the primary finish line. His imprint extends all the way up and down the ballot \u2013 most notably in the fact that at least 12 Republican nominees running to be elections chief in their states have questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale chronicled last month. How Trump and DeSantis are already splitting the conservative movement There are some signs of GOP jitters about how election denialism will play in November. Republican officials have privately groused for months that the smartest strategy is to shift the national conversation away from Trump\u2019s election obsession to voters\u2019 more immediate concerns like inflation, crime and the 2 million encounters with border crossers this fiscal year. Disquiet with Trump\u2019s actions has been evident in some polls. In a recent New York Times/Siena College national survey of registered voters, 54% said that Trump \u201cwent so far that he threatened American democracy\u201d in his actions after the 2020 election, while only 38% said he was \u201cjust exercising his right to contest the election.\u201d But because Trump remains so popular within the GOP base, only a handful of Republican candidates have backtracked in their embrace of Trump\u2019s false election theories as they attempt to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate before the November contests. The most notable examples were in the swing states of New Hampshire and Arizona, two states where independent voters are a powerful force. In Arizona, CNN\u2019s KFile uncovered how GOP Senate nominee Blake Masters removed language from his campaign website that referred to the 2020 election as a \u201crotten mess\u201d and that \u201cif we had had a free and fair election, President Trump would be sitting in the Oval Office today and America would be so much better off.\u201d After the August primary, the page said: \u201cWe need to get serious about election integrity.\u201d (When questioned about website revisions around his position on abortion after the primary, a person close to Masters told CNN that the candidate viewed the policy section of his campaign website as a \u201cliving document.\u201d) The most dramatic reversal was by New Hampshire Senate Republican Don Bolduc who campaigned during the primary on the false premise that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, but then did an about-face shortly after winning the GOP nomination in September, stating that he had \u201cdone a lot of research on this\u201d and spoken to many voters in New Hampshire about it. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion, and I want to be definitive on this: The election was not stolen,\u201d Bolduc said on Fox after his win. \u201cElections have consequences and, unfortunately, President Biden is the legitimate president of this country.\u201d The straddle that DeSantis, and other candidates are attempting could get tougher as the voting in the 2022 and 2024 elections draws closer. Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost her Wyoming primary last month after becoming one of Trump\u2019s most vocal GOP critics, warned during an appearance at the Texas Tribune Festival this weekend that independent voters, along with moderate Republicans and Democrats, \u201cwant sanity.\u201d She urged Americans to vote against election deniers and said she would campaign for Democrats to prevent contenders who echo the former President\u2019s election lies from winning. While demurring on whether she will run for the White House, she said she will do everything she can to prevent Trump from becoming the nominee in 2024 \u2013 and said that if \u201che is the nominee I won\u2019t be a Republican.\u201d Cheney argued that the most important obligation every American has is \u201cto make sure that people who believe in what the election deniers are saying, the people who would tear the Republic down, don\u2019t get power.\u201d Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who proved adept at appealing to independents and moderates in his campaign last year, has taken heat for committing to campaign for Arizona GOP gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake. Youngkin, another potential White House contender, won his election (in a state that Biden won handily the year before) after acknowledging that Biden\u2019s election was legitimate. Lake has falsely stated that the 2020 election was stolen, a centerpiece of her primary campaign. When asked about the incongruence of their positions at the Texas Tribune Festival, Youngkin noted he has said, \u201cI firmly believe that Joe Biden was elected president.\u201d On the question of whether he was comfortable standing alongside a Republican who disputed the 2020 outcome, he replied: \u201cI am comfortable supporting Republican candidates, and we don\u2019t agree on everything.\u201d But a difference over whether the 2020 election was fairly won is no small policy quibble. For some of those coveted voters in the middle who help determine elections on the margins, it will represent the difference between truth and lie. Republicans in tough races who continue to stand with Trump on that subject may end up paying a hefty price.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Friday criticized Republicans and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s proposed midterm agenda, describing the plan as a \u201cthin series of policy goals\u201d in his latest campaign speech. Biden\u2019s speech is part of a broader, ramped up effort by the President and the Democratic Party to capitalize on recent political wins and illustrate their differences with Republicans ahead of the November midterm elections. The President\u2019s remarks came within hours of McCarthy\u2019s event in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, where he unveiled the House GOP platform, dubbed the \u201cCommitment to America.\u201d \u201cHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy went to Pennsylvania and unveiled what he calls a \u2018Commitment to America.\u2019 Now that\u2019s a thin series of policy goals with little or no detail that he says Republicans are going to pursue if they regain control of the Congress,\u201d Biden told a packed auditorium on Friday at a Democratic National Committee event at the National Education Association\u2019s headquarters in Washington. He added: \u201cIn the course of nearly an hour, here\u2019s a few of the things we didn\u2019t hear: We didn\u2019t hear him mention the right to choose, we didn\u2019t hear him mention Medicare, we didn\u2019t hear him mention Social Security.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s plan focused on four main planks \u2013 the economy, crime and border security, education and government accountability. There is also a nod to the culture wars, with Republicans vowing to ensure \u201conly women can compete in women\u2019s sports.\u201d But the document is generally light on specific policy details, making vague promises like protecting \u201cthe lives of unborn children and their mothers,\u201d without articulating how they plan to do so. During his remarks on Friday, the President touted policy wins since he took office, as well as promised to codify Roe v. Wade, protect Social Security and pass an assault weapons ban \u2013 if the Democrats keep control of Congress. Biden specifically called out Republicans for supporting the false claim that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election \u2013 which he argued has become a litmus test to \u201cpledge loyalty to Donald Trump.\u201d The President said that while not all Republicans are \u201cMAGA Republicans,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cself-evident\u201d that \u201cMAGA Republicans\u201d control the party. He also criticized Republicans who have failed to condemn the insurrection and called out GOP members for supporting calls to defund the FBI. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you support law enforcement if you can\u2019t condemn what happened on January the 6th,\u201d Biden said, referring to the riot at the Capitol in 2021, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can\u2019t claim to be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6 patriots.\u201d The President railed against Republicans\u2019 attempts to ban abortions, the GOP\u2019s past tax cuts \u2013 which he argued \u201cbenefited the top 1%\u201d and the party\u2019s opposition to efforts he said would make communities safer. Democrats have seized on a proposal from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, that would implement a federal ban abortion in most cases at 15 weeks of pregnancy. And in Friday\u2019s speech, Biden specifically leaned into criticizing Republican attempts to restrict abortion access \u2013 despite it being an issue he had previously been wary of discussing at length publicly. \u201cIn 46 days, America is going to choose,\u201d the President said. \u201cIf Republicans win control (of) the Congress, abortion will be banned. And by the way, it will be initially banned. But if they win Congress, I will veto it.\u201d The White House continues to target Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s proposed GOP agenda, which includes a requirement that federal legislation would sunset every five years unless reauthorized by Congress. Biden on Friday criticized the House GOP\u2019s \u201clonger, healthier lives for Americans\u201d goal, saying it \u201csounds great\u201d but argued that it isn\u2019t what the GOP stands for. \u201cAlready, 158 House Republicans have signed onto Republican budget that will cut Medicare and Social Security,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u2019s speech on Friday was a part of a flurry of political appearances in the remaining weeks leading up to the midterms. Democrats hope a string of legislative victories and outcry from their base in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to strike down Roe v. Wade have added momentum to their candidates. Earlier this week while in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, Biden attended multiple political fundraisers. Next Tuesday, the President is scheduled to attend a DNC rally in Florida. CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden will attend a Democratic National Committee event on Friday as the White House moves to sharpen the contrast with Republicans on abortion. The Washington event will focus on Biden\u2019s economic agenda and legislative wins, while also serving as another venue for Biden to highlight areas Democrats view as central political strengths less than 50 days from the midterm election: Abortion rights and hitting the GOP\u2019s Medicare and Social Security proposals. Biden has accelerated his political activity over the last several weeks as Democrats press to seize on momentum coming from a string of legislative victories and outcry from their base in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to strike down Roe vs. Wade. He attended multiple party fundraisers this week while in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and is scheduled to attend a DNC rally in Florida on Tuesday. \u201cThis election is going to be tight. Very tight,\u201d Biden told donors on in Manhattan on Thursday. \u201cWe lose the House and Senate, that changes the trajectory of much of what we\u2019re able to do.\u201d The amped up focus on abortion from the President \u2013 who has long been wary of talking publicly about abortion rights \u2013 comes as Democrats have seized on a proposal from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, that would implement a federal ban abortion in most cases at 15 weeks of pregnancy. Biden targeted Graham\u2019s proposal at a fundraiser Thursday, saying it underscored how Republicans \u201chave gotten more extreme in their positions.\u201d Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, made a point of detailing the specifics of Graham\u2019s bill at length \u2013 and the Democratic objections to them \u2013 during an interview at The Atlantic Festival event in Washington. \u201cThe contrast couldn\u2019t be clearer,\u201d Klain said of the two parties heading into the midterms. While Klain said he believed Democrats would hold the House and Senate, historical and economic headwinds are real, particularly for the narrow House Democratic majority. Soaring inflation, which the White House has grappled with for months, remains a pervasive issue even as gas prices have steadily dropped over the course of the summer. While Democrats say they are in a better position than many expected going into the homestretch of the campaign, a series of tight Senate races and Republican advantages across many frontline House districts give the distinct possibility that one, or both, chambers could flip. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot up for grabs, a lot at stake, from choice to social security, to gun rights, to global warming, to democracy itself,\u201d Biden said at the fundraiser. Republicans targeted Biden\u2019s fundraising swing, which has drawn more attention from Biden than campaign events with Democratic candidates over the course of the last several weeks. \u201cFamilies are struggling with an unprecedented crime wave, decades-high inflation, and a wide-open southern border, yet Joe Biden spends his time catering to liberal elites,\u201d Republican National Committee spokeswoman Emma Vaughn said in a statement. Still, Biden has sharpened his political message in recent weeks as his schedule has picked up, particularly on the issue of the abortion rights, and the White House continues to target Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s proposed GOP agenda. Scott\u2019s proposal includes a requirement that federal legislation would sunset every five years unless reauthorized by Congress. That has led critics to say that would include popular programs like Medicare and Social Security \u2013 potent political issues in past elections. Scott, for his part, has appeared to relish the battle over his proposal, which was introduced in his personal capacity and not through his role as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201c@JoeBiden said he wished he had enough copies of my Rescue America plan, so I stopped by the White House today to make sure he did,\u201d Scott wrote in a tweet that pictured him standing in front of the White House. \u201cThanks for spreading the word, Joe!\u201d Biden\u2019s account, a few hours later, tweeted its thanks to Scott \u2013 and its own link to the proposal.

            "article_content": "House Republicans on Thursday rallied around a policy blueprint that will serve as their political mission statement this fall, after getting a sneak peek of the document on Thursday from GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and hearing messaging advice from a former House speaker and former Donald Trump adviser. McCarthy spent over a year collecting input from members and crafting a proposed legislative agenda, which he dubbed the \u201cCommitment to America\u201d and modeled after the GOP\u2019s infamous \u201cContract with America\u201d that helped propel the party to power in 1994. Now, with the election less than two months away and Republicans just five seats shy of a House majority, they\u2019re hoping to duplicate their success from decades ago by giving candidates a platform to run on, drawing a contrast with their Democratic opponents and providing leadership a plan for governing if they reclaim the majority. And with an improved political environment for Democrats after Roe v. Wade was overturned, most Republicans have been eager to shift the conversation away from abortion and talk about other issues like the economy, crime and the border. \u201cElections should be a real contrast,\u201d McCarthy said in an interview. \u201cThe country is hungry for people to sit up and say, \u2018This is what I\u2019ll do. Tell us what you\u2019re for.\u2019\u201d McCarthy and his top lieutenants will formally roll out the agenda Friday at a metal sheet working plant outside Pittsburgh \u2013 a location purposely selected outside of DC. But on Thursday, House Republicans were given a preview of the messaging document in the Capitol. The blueprint, which is being unveiled in both English and Spanish, is broken out into four main sections, though they read more like policy goals than specific legislative prescriptions. One section is focused on the economy and fighting inflation by reducing government spending and making America energy independent; the second is focused on making the nation safer by securing the border and hiring more police officers to fight crime; the third is centered on empowering parents and taking on Big Tech; and the fourth is focused on holding the government accountable and protecting constitutional freedoms. The agenda \u2013 as well as McCarthy\u2019s inclusive, member-driven approach toward assembling it  \u2013 earned wide praise from across the conference on Thursday, with some lawmakers saying this will boost McCarthy in his quest for the speaker\u2019s gavel. \u201cI think it\u2019s good stuff,\u201d said Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the House GOP campaign\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be running for something, not just against it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really enthusiastic,\u201d said Rep. David Schweikert, an Arizona Republican in a competitive race. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand, it\u2019s really positive, and it actually works.\u201d \u201cPeople feel good about it,\u201d said veteran Rep. Tom Cole, a member of GOP leadership. \u201cIt shows the Kevin McCarthy I know: extremely inclusive.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very excited,\u201d added Rep. Kat Cammack, a Florida Republican who is vying to lead the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. \u201cThis is a very thoughtful process. Every single member has had input. \u2026 Trying to wrangle us all is definitely a triumph.\u201d And during the closed-door meeting, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2013 a top Trump ally who has been critical of McCarthy in the past \u2013 praised the document as \u201cfantastic,\u201d according to sources in the room. Greene was selected to join a group of House Republicans traveling to Pittsburgh for the rollout \u2013 just the latest example of how McCarthy has worked to bring even his most hardline members into the fold in his quest for the majority and the speakership. \u201cIt unites the conference,\u201d McCarthy said of his blueprint. \u201cYou know, you\u2019ll always find somebody (who dissents), but overall, you\u2019ve got the spectrum. And that\u2019s not an easy thing to do \u2026 Everybody has skin in the game when everybody\u2019s working on it.\u201d Aside from getting briefed on the \u201cCommitment to America,\u201d members on Thursday also heard from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the architect of the original \u201cContract with America,\u201d as well as Kellyanne Conway, a GOP pollster and former Trump adviser. Conway told lawmakers in the room that she believes touting their policy platform on the campaign trail will be the difference of whether they pick up just a handful of seats or dozens of seats. She also told Republicans that the most salient issues this fall will be security, affordability, fairness and education, and dismissed the \u201csingle digit issue advantage that Democrats have on January 6, or climate, or abortion, in some districts.\u201d Conway encouraged GOP members to be specific when talking about the issues, and she advised Republicans, when asked about abortion, to turn the tables on Democrats and ask which restrictions they support. \u201cI encouraged them to finish their sentences, not just say border security, inflation, crime, economy, Putin and Biden,\u201d Conway told reporters after the meeting. Gingrich \u2013 who predicted Republicans will reclaim the majority by picking up anywhere from 15 to 70 seats \u2013 praised the document as far more \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201csophisticated\u201d than the one he assembled in 1994. Yet McCarthy\u2019s policy blueprint is light on specific proposals and more like policy wish list, which was largely by design: wading into the specific details can be much more difficult and divisive. For example, on the topic of abortion, the agenda simply vows that Republicans will \u201cprotect the lives of unborn children and their mothers.\u201d Rep. Scott Perry, the head of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, called it a \u201cgood start\u201d and said most of the conference was behind it, but acknowledged they\u2019ll need to \u201cput a little more meat on the bones.\u201d By contrast, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell opted not to unveil a formal agenda, which could open Republicans up to attacks. To wit, Democrats have already seized on the House GOP\u2019s policy plans, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office blasting out screenshots of the agenda that were accidently posted online on Wednesday and blasted it as an \u201cextreme MAGA agenda.\u201d McCarthy acknowledged the potential drawbacks to outlining their desired agenda ahead of the midterms, but said there\u2019s far more reward in offering up a platform to the public. \u201cThere\u2019s always a risk, but you won\u2019t be successful,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI think the country will reward someone that\u2019s willing to take the risk to say, \u2018These are our ideas, and this is what we\u2019ll do.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "It was not yet 5 p.m. on a Thursday, but the 818 Club restaurant was already packed as Rep. Marcy Kaptur walked around, greeting locals and introducing herself. For a congresswoman in office for nearly 40 years, you would think she would know more patrons in this popular restaurant. But this business is in a new part of her northern Ohio district, which changed dramatically after the latest round of redistricting, and whether Kaptur has served long enough is one of the most hotly debated questions among potential voters. With Democrats holding a razor thin majority in the House, Kaptur\u2019s race will help determine whether her party will keep control or face steep losses in November\u2019s midterm elections. And even here, where economic struggles are deeply rooted, voters say they will have another issue on their mind as they go to the polls this year \u2013 abortion. Previously, Ohio\u2019s 9th District was so safely Democrat that even though President Joe Biden lost the state in 2020, he carried the district \u2013 which stretched along the coast of Lake Erie from Cleveland to Toledo \u2013 by more than 15 points. Kaptur herself easily won reelection that year. A January 6 rally participant could unseat the longest-serving woman in the House But redistricting shifted the lines, encompassing counties in the northwest part of the state, stretching to the Indiana border - creating a much more conservative 9th district that Donald Trump would have won\u2013 and making Kaptur\u2019s 19th run for office much more competitive. Not since redistricting forced her into a primary against fellow incumbent Dennis Kucinich in 2012 has Kaptur faced such odds. \u201cA lot of shoe leather, a lot of personal visits, a lot of public events,\u201d Kaptur told CNN in an interview between events doing just that. The race also features another dynamic with national implications: Kaptur\u2019s Republican opponent, J.R. Majewski, is an election denier who was at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. He has said he went to protest peacefully and left when \u201cit got ugly.\u201d The contest is a head-on collision between a long-time Rust Belt Democrat and an unabashed Trump Republican. Being a brand name in northern Ohio helps Kaptur a lot. She\u2019s been a recognizable and present figure here for four decades. But she says being a midwestern Democrat in a party increasingly run with big city sensibilities on both coasts is a growing challenge for her. \u201cWhat coastal people, God bless them, don\u2019t understand, is that we lost our middle class,\u201d Kaptur said. \u201cWe lost so many people who\u2019ve worked hard all their lives, including in many of these small towns. I understand that. We feel their pain. We went through it together.\u201d Kaptur is relying on voters like Joe Stallbaum, a member of the sheet metal workers Local 33 Toledo district, a union that endorsed both Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and Kaptur this year. Stallbaum has been working on a massive renovation of Toledo\u2019s convention center for nearly two years and says helping revitalize his hometown fills him with pride. But he also says a lot of his friends and colleagues still feel forgotten. \u201cI think there should be a lot more focus on working class people and what we do,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt just seems like we always get left behind.\u201d A second-generation construction worker, Stallbaum says he watched a lot of his fellow union members abandon the Democratic Party in favor of Trump in 2016 and other Republicans since then. With union households making up close to 20% of the vote, it helps explain Democrats\u2019 struggles in Ohio and other parts of the Rust Belt. But Stallbaum believes that Kaptur is different than the national Democratic Party \u2013 she\u2019s someone who appreciates and understands blue collar workers. \u201cI always felt that Marcy listened to working class people. That\u2019s one of the things I like about her. I think she\u2019s very approachable. She doesn\u2019t seem distant to me. I feel I could have reached out to her anytime I had wanted to.\u201d A longtime Kaptur supporter, he plans to vote for her again. \u201cShe\u2019s never given me a reason not to support her. Everything she\u2019s always done is for Toledo and for our region,\u201d he said. \u201cI trust her.\u201d But that kind of support for Kaptur is harder to find in the new, conservative parts of the district \u2013 especially at Bud\u2019s Restaurant in Defiance, Ohio, where the coffee is always hot and the conversation is always lively - especially early in the mornings when a regular group of men fill the booths. CNN asked the seven men stretching across two tables if anyone planned to vote for Kaptur. Only one said yes. Trump won Defiance County by more than 35 points in 2020. He endorsed Kaptur\u2019s challenger Majewski in June. For Joe Clements, Trump\u2019s endorsement alone is enough. \u201cIt means a lot. I like Trump,\u201d he said. But that\u2019s controversial, even here. \u201cThe man wants to be a dictator,\u201d said Steve Santo, the lone Kaptur supporter at the table. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand that. He tried to overthrow our government. And that\u2019s the bottom line and you guys can\u2019t see it. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s what happened on January 6. You can\u2019t tell me any different.\u201d Majewski\u2019s presence at the Capitol on the day of the insurrection is a deal breaker for Santo. \u201cI would never vote for him. For any of those people who were there on January 6th. They actually tried to overtake our government.\u201d His friend Scott Brown disagreed. \u201cI think there were a lot of people who were there that didn\u2019t go in - just were there to be part of it. So I don\u2019t think that would influence my vote against him.\u201d Brown, now retired, says his party allegiance has changed in recent years. \u201cI always considered myself a Democrat. Since the way Democrats have been coming down on everything, I changed my feelings about that, and now I have signed up to be a Republican.\u201d Terry Howarth was also down on Democrats in Washington. \u201cBiden\u2019s got this country - you know Afghanistan, the border, inflation, this student loan thing.\u201d he said, pausing on his list of grievances with the Biden administration to emphasize how upset he is about the president\u2019s plan for student loan forgiveness. \u201cI paid for my kids\u2019 education, I paid for my own education. If you go to college, you expect the guy who\u2019s like who just barely get by here. Expect them to pay for somebody\u2019s college education?\u201d Still, not all voters at Bud\u2019s are sold on Majewski, an Air Force veteran who became known in this area for turning his lawn into a 19,000-foot Trump 2020 sign. CNN\u2019s KFILE unearthed evidence Majewski repeatedly promoted QAnon conspiracies,  though he\u2019s since denied being a follower. He\u2019s also spread the baseless theory that the January 6 attack was \u201cdriven by the F.B.I. and it was a stage show.\u201d Seth Peters, a Republican, hasn\u2019t decided who he\u2019s going to vote for, because he doesn\u2019t know enough about Majewski\u2019s platform. \u201cI want to see how he would improve the area. How he would do in Congress, what his plans are. Because I\u2019m 30, almost 31, my wife and I are probably going to have kids and what are they going to do for our kids, for our grandkids, our future?\u201d Peters asked. Through a spokesman, Majewski declined CNN\u2019s request for an interview to answer such questions, or provide any information about public events where he might be explaining his positions. Even amidst a struggling economy, many of the voters CNN talked to across the district said abortion was a top concern. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion, many voters have become energized by the issue that was once considered settled law. In Toledo, Stallbaum, the union member and sheet metal worker, said women\u2019s rights was the number one issue driving his vote. Graham's 15-week abortion bill further complicates Republican midterm messaging \u201cI may not agree with it, somebody else may not agree with it. That doesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d he said of abortion. \u201cWhat matters to me is that it\u2019s your decision to make. That person\u2019s, that woman\u2019s decision to make, nobody else\u2019s. And I think that was absolutely wrong to take that away. He attributes some of that to his union values. \u201cIn the trades, it doesn\u2019t matter what your race, your religion, your political affiliation, your gender, we all get paid the same. Men and women side by side get paid exactly the same in hourly rate. Exactly the same in benefits. It should be like that across the board.\u201d Back at Bud\u2019s, Republican-leaning voter Terry Howarth is also concerned. \u201cI realize as a medic retired from the medical field, that to overturn Roe vs. Wade, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of women who die,\u201d he said, but also made clear the issue is not driving his vote and still intended to support Republicans here in November. Across the table from Howarth, Greg Steyer says it is his top issue. He\u2019s Catholic, firmly against abortion, and though his son once worked for Kaptur, he says he will vote against her because she supports abortion rights. \u201cObviously the Democratic Party supports abortion. Probably the biggest question I have is, how [\u2026] Catholic leadership can say that they are strong Catholics and still support abortion?\u201d  said Steyer. \u201cGreg and I disagree on the abortion issue,\u201d Howarth shot back. \u201cWe need to do something to change that we\u2019re not having 700,000 abortions a year. But we cannot make it illegal.\u201d Following the Supreme Court striking down Roe, a law passed by the Ohio state legislature in 2019 went into effect, prohibiting abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That law was temporarily blocked last week, so abortions in the state currently can be obtained up to 20 weeks post-fertilization. Majewski has not been outspoken on the issue. Kaptur supports a woman\u2019s right to choose \u2013 and told CNN that she hears about it from voters across the state. \u201cI had a young woman come up to me in Defiance, and she said, \u2018Marcy, if something happens, what am I supposed to do?\u2019 She was in tears,\u201d Kaptur said. She acknowledged that the right to an abortion is tenuous in her state. \u201cOhio is a state where that 10-year-old girl, who was a victim of incest, was made to go out of state. Her adult relatives had to take her out of state to make a decision, a consequential decision,\u201d Kaptur said, referring to the young girl who traveled to Indiana earlier this year for an abortion. \u201cI think people want that decision to be made freely, within the confines of their own family, and they don\u2019t want politicians or Washington taking away their freedom.\u201d Kaptur is currently the longest serving female member in the history of the House of Representatives. If she wins in November and is sworn in for a 20th term, she will break another record, surpassing former Sen. Barbara Mikulski as the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress. That fact that she\u2019s been in office so long sparks strong feelings among voters, especially at Buds. \u201cIf the guy from Toledo wins, we\u2019re back to base one again,\u201d said Santo, referring to Majewski, the GOP challenger. \u201cOh, do you want to be on this committee? Well, we\u2019ll let you be on there for a minute or so, but you have no say in what goes on. But now Marcy\u2019s already got it going on. She can do more for Ohio right now than anybody else,\u201d he added. This sparked friendly jabs from others at the table, teasing him that he sounds like an advertisement for Kaptur. \u201cNot that she\u2019s not a good person. I just think she\u2019s been in office long enough,\u201d said Brown. Others said Kaptur\u2019s nearly 40 years in office exemplifies the need for term limits in Congress. When CNN asked Kaptur about those concerns, she insisted her longevity is a big part of what makes her successful. \u201cWhen you come from this part of the country, all you have is your seniority and your work ethic in order to deliver for your people. Because the other places have more voices - California has almost 60 members of Congress. Ohio only has 15,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen you get there, you\u2019re outnumbered, and you don\u2019t have the gavel, you don\u2019t have some of the resources that they have. So, it takes longer to achieve something.\u201d As the longtime Ohio lawmaker enters the final weeks of the most competitive race she has had in a while, she honed her Rust Belt pitch for yet another term. \u201cI come from the working-class people. I know what it takes. And there so few such voices. So, I stand on the shoulders of people who have sacrificed greatly,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "Republican Senate candidates eager to make the 2022 midterms about inflation, crime and President Joe Biden\u2019s first term have a new dilemma in Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s bill that would ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The bill, which the South Carolina Republican introduced this week on a day of disappointing inflation news, presents his party with problems that are two-fold as they look to flip the House and Senate in November: Not only does it resurface the abortion debate, a topic many Republicans have sought to avoid since the Supreme Court, in a publicly unpopular decision, overturned Roe v. Wade in June, but it steps on the answers GOP candidates had coalesced around this summer \u2013 that abortion should be an issue left to the states, not the federal government. Many Republican Senate candidates appear ill-prepared to respond to the Graham bill, with several either distancing themselves from it, obfuscating with their answers or just not engaging on the topic, while GOP leadership appears reluctant to endorse Graham\u2019s proposal. Other nominees have more eagerly embraced it, believing it gives them a position to counter Democratic attacks tying them to some of the most extreme state measures or the threat of a total national ban. (Graham\u2019s proposal provides exceptions for abortions required to protect the life of the mother, and if the woman becomes pregnant through rape or incest.) Graham proposes 15-week abortion bill, dividing Republicans ahead of midterm elections In private, though, many Republican operatives are rolling their eyes at Graham, especially those tasked with winning key Senate seats. Republicans only need a net gain of one seat to flip the chamber, but the shifting political landscape in the months since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision has already dimmed hopes of an overwhelming red wave. \u201cIt certainly does complicate some things,\u201d said a Republican operative working on Senate races. \u201cFor some candidates, this is a fight they are willing to have. \u2026 But for others, they don\u2019t want to talk about abortion at all.\u201d \u201cLindsey is trying to be helpful. But he doesn\u2019t always know the best way to do it,\u201d the operative added. That has been clear in some of the strained ways Republican Senate candidates have responded to the bill. Georgia Senate nominee Herschel Walker took two incongruent positions in his statement, saying he believes \u201cthe issue should be decided at the state level\u201d but that he would support such a federal law. Pennsylvania Senate nominee Mehmet Oz issued his standard statement on being \u201cpro-life\u201d with exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother, but did not take a firm position on the Graham bill. Other Republican Senate nominees did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions, including Ohio\u2019s J.D. Vance and North Carolina\u2019s Rep. Ted Budd. Several conservative media outlets have reacted to the bill with frustration at the political inconvenience it poses for Republican candidates. The Wall Street Journal editorial board criticized Graham this week for \u201ctaking a big political gamble\u201d that exposes GOP candidates and gives swing voters in important states a reason to vote against the party. A recent Wall Street Journal survey found 57% of registered voters oppose a 15-week ban with an exception for the health of the mother. But a source familiar with the South Carolina Republican\u2019s thinking said Graham believes that trying to sidestep the abortion issue is not working for Republicans while Democrats make it a central focus in virtually every key race; as much as the GOP wants to talk about other topics, like the economy, it\u2019s just not realistic. Members of the anti-abortion movement agree that offense, not defense, is the best position on the issue. \u201cThey cannot wish the issue away,\u201d Ramesh Ponnuru, the editor of the conservative magazine National Review, told CNN. \u201cWhat they can do is decide whether they want to influence the terms of the debate, or whether they want to have the debate on the terms that it\u2019s been proceeding on.\u201d Abortion is banned or severely limited in a number of states. Here's where things stand Democrats, however, are happy to have Republicans stepping into the debate. Emboldened after voters in Kansas rejected a ballot measure that would\u2019ve given the GOP-led state legislature the ability to push an abortion ban and after voters in New York and Alaska helped Democrats win House special elections by running on abortion, Democrats have responded to the Graham bill by redoubling their efforts, gleefully noting the difficult position this puts Republicans in. \u201cSenate Republicans are putting one of the ugliest, least popular pieces of their agenda on full display,\u201d said David Bergstein, top spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cFor voters, it will be another powerful argument to vote against GOP Senate candidates in November.\u201d Graham was even on the defensive during what would normally be a friendly interview with Fox News, with host Jesse Watters taking him to task for giving Democrats \u201can out\u201d on the economy. Inflation, which Republicans have been hammering Democrats over for most of the campaign, ticked back up in August, according to government data released Tuesday \u2013 the same day Graham unveiled his proposal. \u201cI am proudly pro-life, and I have no apology for being pro-life, and there is no bad time to defend the unborn,\u201d Graham said in the interview, at one point raising his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a bad day to stand up for the unborn. \u2026 We need to go on the offensive here.\u201d Graham largely didn\u2019t engage in the tactics behind making such an announcement two months before Election Day, instead asking, \u201cIf not now, when? If not me, who?\u201d Analysis: What I think Lindsey Graham is up to with his 15-week abortion ban Not all Republicans are running from Graham or the 15-week limit. Despite his silence on the bill, Vance will attend a fundraiser next month with the South Carolina senator. And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is up for reelection this year, has co-sponsored Graham\u2019s bill, tweeting that \u201cthe extremists\u201d on the issue are Democrats, like his opponent Rep. Val Demings, not Republicans. Blake Masters, the GOP Senate nominee in Arizona, has faced scrutiny for his recent attempts to moderate his position on abortion since winning his primary last month. But this week, he leaned into his support for limiting abortion access. \u201cOf course, I support Lindsey Graham\u2019s 15-week bill, and I hope it passes,\u201d Masters said in a statement to CNN. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, I suggest and will introduce a third-trimester standalone bill.\u201d Anti-abortion activists, besides supporting the bill on its merits, argue it benefits Republicans politically. \u201cI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t talk about inflation, don\u2019t talk about the economy, but you also have to address the issue of the moment,\u201d said Mallory Carroll, a spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a political group whose president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, stood behind Graham this week while he introduced his bill. \u201cGraham has given a gift to those that are running for reelection because this bill is a politically defensible position to take that also moves the ball forward for the pro-life movement and saves lives.\u201d But plenty of Republican leaders do not see it that way. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell appears far from eager to follow Graham\u2019s lead on abortion, telling CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that \u201cmost of the members of my conference prefer that this be dealt with at the state level\u201d and declining to offer public guidance to candidates on the issue. \u201cI think every Republican senator running this year in these contested races has an answer as to how they feel about the issue, and it may be different in different states,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said Tuesday. \u201cSo, I leave it up to our candidates who are quite capable of handling this issue to determine for them what their response is.\u201d And when asked on Wednesday if a future Republican House majority would hold a vote on the Graham bill, GOP Whip Steve Scalise demurred and instead tried to focus on what he deemed extremism by Democrats. \u201cWell, first we need to see what our majority looks like,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cBut I think if you\u2019ve seen, we are a party that defends life, we stand up for life.\u201d That reluctance from leadership has left Republican candidates largely on their own, following advice from party campaign committees presented after the court\u2019s decision was announced to try to put the focus back on Democrats\u2019 abortion policy \u2013 primarily the reluctance by some candidates to be clear about what, if any, limits they support on the procedure. A polling memo conducted for the Republican National Committee and released on Tuesday encouraged candidates to \u201cput your opponent on defense and force them to answer for their extreme position.\u201d And a presentation for candidates from the National Republican Senatorial Committee advises them to stick to the message that \u201cyour opponent is the extremist\u201d and \u201cyou are the compassionate reasonable person.\u201d \u201cBUT, don\u2019t let campaign become about abortion \u2013 get back to where the voters are \u2013 inflation, gas prices, energy, crime, border security, etc.,\u201d reads the last slide of the presentation. While securing the most politically sellable restrictions on abortion remains important to anti-abortion advocates, Republican operatives think that goal conflicts with their mission: Winning big at the ballot box. \u201cThe party is more interested in making sure that it\u2019s a big Republican wave than a Republican ripple,\u201d said Ponnuru. \u201cThere\u2019s just a divergence of priorities.\u201d As Graham\u2019s plan was rolled out, Democratic campaign after campaign used it to push their opponents, underscoring how united Democrats are broadly on the issue while Republicans struggle with how to talk about it. The Graham bill also gave Democrats an opportunity to cry hypocrisy, given many Republican candidates had been saying the issue was better left to the states, not a federal bill. New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan made abortion the focus on her first general election ad after Tuesday\u2019s primary in the state saw Don Bolduc win the Republican Party\u2019s Senate nomination. \u201cDon Bolduc and anti-choice Republicans are taking away your personal freedoms,\u201d says the ad\u2019s narrator. Cheri Beasley, the Democratic nominee in North Carolina, accused Budd of being \u201cso hell-bent on getting in between a woman and her doctor that he would ban abortion even in instances of rape, incest and threats to a woman\u2019s life.\u201d Budd called instances of rape or incest a \u201ctragedy\u201d in an interview with CBS earlier this year, but added, \u201cLet\u2019s also realize there\u2019s a second life there\u201d and \u201cwhy would you want to take a second life for something that\u2019s already been harmed.\u201d And Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democratic Senate nominee in the commonwealth, used Oz\u2019s lack of a firm answer on the Graham bill to ask: \u201cWould you vote for Sen. Graham\u2019s bill to ban abortions after 15 weeks?\u201d \u201cDr. Oz and his team need to stop the spin and stop the bull****,\u201d Fetterman said in a statement. \u201cThis is a bill that he would actually have to vote on. Oz needs to tell us \u2014 yes or no, would you support this bill?\u201d CNN has reached out to multiple Oz aides for clarity on how he would vote on the Graham bill. None have responded. The rapid fire reaction highlights how Democrats see the issue as a winner after effectively mobilizing around it in contests this summer. Laphonza Butler, the president of Emily\u2019s List, an organization focused on electing Democratic women who support abortion rights, said Republicans \u201ctry to mislead voters about their agendas and hide their real records,\u201d but the Graham bill makes clear that their goal is to \u201cend abortion.\u201d \u201cThe path to stopping them and protecting our freedom is equally clear: we must keep and expand our majorities in Congress,\u201d she said. The clearest way Democrats are leaning into the abortion debate is through the money they\u2019re spending. According to AdImpact data as of early September, campaigns and groups from both parties have combined to spend more than $84 million on over 350 unique ads about abortion since the court\u2019s decision, with nearly $66 million on more than 250 of the ads coming from Democratic campaigns or groups. Republicans, by contrast, are putting little money behind the issue. According to AdImpact, the party\u2019s campaigns and committees have spent just under $11 million airing 81 ads about abortion.

            "article_content": "More than half of the Republican nominees for the 35 US Senate seats being contested in the 2022 midterms have challenged the legitimacy of the 2020 election \u2013 rejecting, raising doubts about or taking steps to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. A CNN analysis found that at least 19 of this year\u2019s Republican nominees have contested or refused to affirm the 2020 results. The list includes five incumbent senators and 11 other candidates who have at least a reasonable chance of winning in November. The success of election deniers in Republican Senate primaries around the country \u2013 from the southern border to the northern border; in swing states, conservative states and liberal states; among established officeholders and first-time candidates \u2013 is yet more evidence of the broad support among party voters for former President Donald Trump\u2019s lie that the election was stolen. The 19 Republican Senate nominees on this list of election deniers and doubters join at least 11 Republican nominees for state secretary of state and at least 22 Republican nominees for governor. US senators generally have less power over elections than secretaries of state and governors do, but they do have the power to object to certifying electoral votes, to write and vote on election legislation, and sometimes to hold hearings and issue subpoenas on election issues. Not all election deniers are alike. Some of the Senate candidates on the list have made formal attempts to reverse the will of the American people \u2013 for example, by voting to reject the congressional certification of electoral votes Biden won \u2013 while others have made false claims from the sidelines. Some of the candidates have aggressively spread specific conspiracy theories; others have evasively complained of \u201cirregularities\u201d and refused to answer directly when asked whether Biden was legitimately elected. We will update the list if we find evidence that additional Senate nominees should be included. (There has been little media coverage of some longshot nominees, like Bob McDermott of Hawaii and Gerald Malloy of Vermont.) Here is the rundown as it stands in mid-September now that the primary elections have concluded. Alabama Republican nominee Katie Britt told NBC News in May 2022 that she would have objected to the 2020 election results if she had been in the Senate on January 6, 2021. The next month, she told Fox: \u201cI\u2019ve said many times that there were major problems with the 2020 election, and we have to make sure that we uphold the integrity and security of our elections. I\u2019ve called for a forensic audit to make sure we get to the bottom of it and that people can have faith in our electoral process.\u201d AL.com reported in March 2022 that Britt would not go so far as to agree that the election was \u201cstolen,\u201d but Britt also didn\u2019t reject that false notion. Instead, she responded indirectly, saying: \u201cI believe that there was fraud. I think you have to have a forensic audit. You have to give people peace and clear confidence that their vote is going to matter the next time.\u201d Britt is the former chief of staff to outgoing Sen. Richard Shelby and former chief executive of the Business Council of Alabama. Her Democratic opponent is Will Boyd, a pastor who once served as a city councilman in Illinois. Britt\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Arizona Republican nominee Blake Masters has been explicit in declaring that \u201cthe 2020 election wasn\u2019t free or fair.\u201d In an ad Masters released in November 2021, early in the Republican primary, he said, wrongly, \u201cI think Trump won in 2020.\u201d The rest of the ad was more subjective; Masters argued that Trump would have won in a \u201cfair fight\u201d without supposed anti-Trump media bias, \u201cbig tech\u201d suppression of a late-election story about Biden\u2019s family, and some states having changed their rules to allow for easier mail-in voting. But Masters\u2019 ad-opening claim that Trump actually did win is plain false. Masters, a venture capitalist, has also made or promoted other false claims about the 2020 election. Two days after the election, Masters chided the media for supposedly declining to investigate claims about ballots being cast in the names of dead people in some Democratic-dominated cities; the claims appeared dubious from the start, and media outlets were investigating them \u2013 and debunking them. In September 2021, Masters echoed one of Trump\u2019s favored conspiracy theories, falsely declaring that opinion polls that showed Biden with big leads during the 2020 campaign were \u201cdesigned to suppress the Trump vote.\u201d At a campaign event in June 2022, Masters spoke supportively of the baseless suggestion that there is mass cheating in the vote-counting process. He said he couldn\u2019t prove his father wrong when his father told him that, if Masters were to win his Senate race by 30,000 votes against Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly, \u201cI think that they\u2019ll find 40,000 for Mark Kelly.\u201d Masters added, \u201cI think there\u2019s always cheating, probably, in every election. The question is, what\u2019s the cheating capacity? I don\u2019t know exactly how many illegal and legal votes each of Trump and Biden got in 2020, but I look at all the signs, I look at things going wrong\u2026\u201d At the end of the Republican primary in early August, Masters\u2019 campaign website claimed that \u201cif we had had a free and fair election, President Trump would be sitting in the Oval Office today.\u201d After Masters won the primary, CNN\u2019s KFile team reported, that language was removed from the site and replaced with this vague declaration: \u201cWe need to get serious about election integrity.\u201d Masters\u2019 campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Earlier this year, California Republican nominee Mark Meuser told television station KPIX 5 of the 2020 election: \u201cThere are so many irregularities about this election that I do not feel any American who looks at it can have confidence that they know what the actual results are.\u201d Meuser, a lawyer who was trounced in a California secretary of state election in 2018 and in a state Senate election in 2012, is making a longshot challenge to incumbent Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla, who beat him in the 2018 secretary of state race. Meuser\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Herschel Walker, the Georgia Republican nominee and a former football star, has made a variety of wild false claims about the 2020 election. In a tweet on January 6, 2021, after the Capitol was attacked by pro-Trump rioters, Walker said he wanted Trump to get to the bottom of \u201cwho stole this election.\u201d In late 2020 and early 2021, Walker falsely declared he could \u201cguarantee you\u201d that Biden \u201cdidn\u2019t get 50 million people voting for him\u201d (in fact, more than 81 million people voted for Biden), promoted a baseless conspiracy theory about Dominion Voting Systems technology and another conspiracy theory about imaginary vote-stealing software, said Georgia should refuse to certify Biden\u2019s victory Georgia victory because of \u201cserious Election Fraud,\u201d wrongly alleged \u201cCountry wide election fraud,\u201d and proposed that all votes in Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin be tossed out and that these seven states \u2013 six of which were won by Biden \u2013 \u201cvote again.\u201d In May 2022, Walker told reporters that \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d whether Biden was lawfully elected and that there were \u201cproblems\u201d with what happened in the election, The New York Times reported. Walker is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. Walker\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Incumbent Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul voted to certify Biden\u2019s victory on January 6, 2021, noting that \u201cit was never intended by our founders that Congress have the power to overturn state-certified elections.\u201d But Paul has also made false claims about the 2020 election. He declared at a Senate hearing in December 2020: \u201cThe fraud happened. The election in many ways was stolen.\u201d As a supposed example, Paul said, \u201cWe can\u2019t just say, \u2018Oh, 4,000 people voted in Nevada that were non-citizens, and we\u2019re just going to ignore it. We\u2019re going to sweep it under the rug.\u2019\u201d There is no evidence of thousands of non-citizens voting in Nevada; an investigation by the office of Nevada\u2019s secretary of state, a Republican, later found that fraud wasn\u2019t proven by the data that Republican activists had cited to make this allegation. Three days after the election in November 2020, Paul tweeted that while it is usually difficult for \u201cvoter fraud in absentee voting\u201d to affect the outcome of an election, there were many more mail ballots than usual this time. (Again, voter fraud didn\u2019t affect the outcome.) Paul went further later that month, falsely claiming on Twitter, \u201cWhen the media says no evidence of widespread fraud, perhaps they mean no evidence, if you look the other way\u2026\u201d (He linked to an article that did not demonstrate fraud.) In another November 2020 tweet, Paul asked people to \u201cdecide for yourself\u201d whether so-called \u201cdata dumps\u201d late on the night of the election \u2013 in reality, just votes being counted and publicly reported \u2013 represented fraud or statistical anomalies. Paul has also made a subjective argument that state officials acted improperly by changing election rules without approval from state legislators. Paul spokesperson Kelsey Cooper said in an email to CNN in August 2022: \u201cSenator Paul voted to accept the state certified electors consistent with the constitutional mandate that states conduct elections. Discussing election fraud is in no conceivable way an incitement to anything but legislative reform. Senator Paul will continue to advocate that no state official can change election law without a vote from the majority of the state legislature.\u201d Paul\u2019s Democratic opponent is former Kentucky state representative Charles Booker. Incumbent Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy objected to the certification of Biden\u2019s victory in Arizona, though Kennedy voted to certify Biden\u2019s victory in Pennsylvania. Kennedy has tried to differentiate himself from congressional colleagues who wanted to overturn the entire election. He said in a May 2021 interview with WWL-TV that he chose to object only to Biden\u2019s victory in Arizona because Biden would still have prevailed without that state\u2019s 11 electoral votes. Nonetheless, Kennedy still attempted to override the will of millions of Americans. And he has broadly questioned the legitimacy of the election as a whole. Days before the votes on January 6, 2021, Kennedy issued a statement, along with some of his Republican colleagues, that said: \u201cBy any measure, the allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.\u201d (There were indeed many allegations of fraud, but there was a tiny amount of actual fraud.) And in December 2020, Kennedy sent out a fundraising email, previously reported by the Louisiana Illuminator, in which he wrote that there had been \u201ca lot of tomfoolery and a few too many shenanigans with this election\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m thinking we may need to take a second look at those ballots and the legitimacy of this election.\u201d That email also tried to straddle both sides; Kennedy wrote, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that something DID happen, but I\u2019m not so sure something DIDN\u2019T HAPPEN.\u201d Kennedy has continued to say such things since. He said in the May 2021 interview: \u201cYou will never find where I ever said, anywhere, that the election was stolen or not stolen. You won\u2019t find it.\u201d After alleging in the interview that Democrats in some states \u201cexploited the pandemic to change their states\u2019 election laws in an unconstitutional manner,\u201d he added, \u201cNow having said that, I have never seen demonstrated evidence, proven in a court of law, that it made a difference. I\u2019m not saying it did, I\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t.\u201d Kennedy is the top Republican in Louisiana\u2019s open primary, whose field also includes a group of Democratic candidates. Kennedy\u2019s office declined to comment for this article. Chris Chaffee, the little-known Republican Senate nominee in Maryland, has falsely called the 2020 election \u201cfraudulent\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d and baselessly referred to \u201cthis coup against the President and the election.\u201d He has also promoted specific baseless conspiracy theories about the election, like one about voting machines. Chaffee, who was routed in a 2014 congressional race against Democratic incumbent Rep. Steny Hoyer, is now a major underdog to incumbent Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen. Asked for his stance on the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s win, and whether he stands by his expressed opinions that the election was fraudulent and corrupt, Chaffee said in an email to CNN last week: \u201cMy stance is this is September 6, 2022 and we need to move forward. The general election for 2022 is November 8, 2022. Please concentrate on that. We must ensure that in the 2022 United States elections have integrity.\u201d As Missouri\u2019s attorney general, Republican Senate nominee Eric Schmitt supported a December 2020 effort to overturn the election \u2013 signing on Missouri to the Texas-led lawsuit that sought to get the Supreme Court to rescind Biden\u2019s victory. Schmitt is running against Democrat Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and an heir to the Anheuser-Busch beer fortune, for the open seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Schmitt\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Nevada Republican nominee Adam Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign in Nevada, played a leading role in post-election legal efforts to reverse Biden\u2019s victory in the state. Laxalt, the former Nevada attorney general, wrote a November 2020 article that falsely claimed \u201cwe now know that there are thousands of illegal votes consisting of a combination of dead voters, out-of-state voters, double voters (those who cast ballots in Nevada and another state), among other improper votes.\u201d None of these claims was accurate; the subsequent review by the office of Nevada\u2019s Republican secretary of state did not find \u201cevidentiary support\u201d for fellow Republicans\u2019 various fraud claims. In other comments in November 2020, Laxalt said the number of improper ballots in Nevada could even be in the tens of thousands. He also cast aspersions upon the demonstrably legal votes of members of the military who voted in Nevada after being transferred to other states. And he continued to make false claims about Nevada elections long after Republican efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s defeat fizzled. Days after launching his Senate campaign in August 2021, Laxalt falsely said the 2020 election was \u201crigged\u201d and floated the idea of filing \u201cearly\u201d lawsuits related to the midterms. At campaign events in October 2021, NBC News reported, he baselessly told voters that elections are legitimate in the state\u2019s 15 rural counties but are untrustworthy in the two urban counties where well over 80% of the state population lives. That same month, he declined to answer directly when a reporter asked him if Biden was legitimately elected. Laxalt is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. Laxalt\u2019s campaign did not respond a request for comment for this article. Don Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general who won the New Hampshire Republican nomination on Tuesday, was unabashed during the Republican primary in falsely declaring that Biden\u2019s victory was illegitimate. Bolduc said at an August debate in New Hampshire\u2019s Republican primary: \u201cI signed a letter with 120 other generals and admirals saying that Donald Trump won the election and, dammit, I stand by\u201d it. That comment, previously reported by The New York Times, appeared to be a reference to a May 2021 letter that vaguely suggested the election results did not reflect the will of the people. Bolduc was more explicit in his own comments, baselessly saying in 2021 that \u201cI think there was a tremendous amount of fraud across this country and in every state\u201d and falsely claiming in 2021 that New Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor and federal Democratic incumbents have won races by \u201cmathematically impossible\u201d margins. On Thursday, two days after entering the general election against incumbent Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan, Bolduc flip-flopped on the 2020 election. He said on Fox that after doing research and spending \u201cthe past couple of weeks\u201d talking to New Hampshire residents, \u201cI have come to the conclusion \u2013 and I want to be definitive on this \u2013 the election was not stolen.\u201d He said that while there was fraud in the election, Biden is unfortunately \u201cthe legitimate president of this country.\u201d After a Fox host noted that Bolduc\u2019s new comments were quite a change from his declaration just a month ago that Trump won, Bolduc said, \u201cWe all have time to make up \u2013 you know, to make up for mistakes or for things that we\u2019ve said that aren\u2019t accurate. And that\u2019s part of learning, that\u2019s part of listening.\u201d Bolduc is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. Bolduc\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. On January 6, 2021, North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd voted to object to the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona. Budd also expressed support in December 2020 for the Texas-led lawsuit that sought to overturn Biden\u2019s win. And three days after the election in November 2020, Budd joined some of his House Republican colleagues in sending a letter to the US attorney general demanding action in relation to \u201cwidespread reports of irregularities, particularly in the vote counting process\u201d \u2013 though the votes were counted accurately and the usual scattered errors were quickly corrected. When an Associated Press journalist asked Budd later in 2021 if Biden won the election fair and square, Budd responded, \u201cHe did. He\u2019s the legitimate president.\u201d But after the clip of Budd\u2019s comments was circulated in early 2022 by backers of one of his opponents in the Republican Senate primary, Budd claimed he had been taken out of context. He told Queen City News in April 2022 that Biden \u201cis the president, but I have tremendous constitutional concerns about how the election of 2020 happened.\u201d In a CNN interview in May 2022, Budd declined even when pressed to say Biden won the election. Instead, he said that Biden is the current president but that he has \u201cconstitutional concerns\u201d about the election. Budd is running against Democrat Cheri Beasley, a former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Budd\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. When J.D. Vance was asked by Spectrum News in January 2022 whether he felt the election was stolen, Vance responded, \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Vance continued: \u201cI mean, look, I think the fundamental problem is we had a massive effort to shift the election by very powerful people in this country. I don\u2019t care whether you say it\u2019s rigged, whether you say it\u2019s stolen\u2026\u201d As Ohio\u2019s Republican primary continued, Vance explicitly claimed that \u201cI think the election was stolen from Trump.\u201d Vance, a venture capitalist and author who won the primary in May 2022, has based some of his argument on unproven assertions that the actions of Facebook and founder Mark Zuckerberg, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to support the activities of local elections offices around the country amid the Covid-19 pandemic, were meant to swing the election to Democrats. (A spokesperson for Zuckerberg told The New York Times this year that the donations were a one-time effort amid a national health crisis \u201cto help ensure that Americans could vote.\u201d) But Vance has also made provably false claims about the election. Vance told Youngstown\u2019s The Vindicator newspaper in October 2021 that \u201cthere were certainly people voting illegally on a large-scale basis,\u201d though that is not true. And though Vance said the election in Ohio was \u201cpretty gold standard,\u201d he also said \u201cI think it\u2019s probably true that Trump won by a larger margin in Ohio,\u201d though there is no basis for questioning Trump\u2019s certified 8-point margin of victory there. Vance said in July 2021 that \u201cI think Josh Hawley did the right thing\u201d in objecting to the certification of some Biden-won states, Time magazine reported. Vance\u2019s Democratic opponent is Rep. Tim Ryan; they are competing for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. The Vance campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. In December 2020, incumbent Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford raised vague concerns about possible fraud in voting and in other states\u2019 vote-counting processes. Lankford then joined Kennedy of Louisiana and some other Senate Republicans in signing a January 2021 statement in which they announced their intention to object to the congressional certification of \u201cdisputed states\u201d and said they would push for a so-called \u201cemergency 10-day audit\u201d of those states\u2019 results. In his own statement the same day, Lankford cited \u201creports of problems with voting machines, people voting twice, non-residents voting in a state, or people mysteriously voting after their death months or years before\u201d \u2013 though such issues were very rare and did not affect the outcome. After a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, Lankford abandoned his plan to object to the certification of Biden victories. He also issued an apology letter that month to Black constituents, writing that he hadn\u2019t realized that the national \u201cconversation\u201d about Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u201cwas seen as casting doubt on the validity of votes coming out of predominantly Black communities like Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Detroit.\u201d But Lankford later continued to express doubts about the legitimacy of Biden\u2019s victory. He told CNN in July 2021: \u201cBiden is the constitutional President. No question about that. Are there questions that are still hanging out there? Yes.\u201d When asked if those questions would have changed the outcome, he responded, \u201cThere is no way to know because we can\u2019t get a full answer to some of them.\u201d And he added: \u201cIt\u2019s unknown at this point. I just want all the questions answered so people can know one way or the other on it.\u201d Lankford is being challenged by Democratic candidate Madison Horn, a cybersecurity professional. Lankford\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment for this article. - CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox and Alex Rogers contributed to this item. When the candidates in the Republican primary in Oklahoma\u2019s special Senate election to replace retiring Republican Sen. James Inhofe were asked during an August 2022 debate if they thought the 2020 election was a lie and if they thought Trump won, Rep. Markwayne Mullin responded by baselessly rejecting the verified fact that Biden earned more votes than any previous presidential candidate. Mullin said: \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be very hard to convince me that Joe Biden received more election \u2013 or, more votes \u2013 than any other president in history. It is absolutely absurd to think that\u2019s even possible.\u201d Mullin, who went on to win the primary, voted in 2021 to object to the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s victories in Pennsylvania and Arizona. He tweeted at the time that he was objecting \u201cdue to all the fraud and uncertainty,\u201d though there was and is no evidence of fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome. Two days prior to the vote, he told constituents that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not think the election was honest. Mullin\u2019s Democratic opponent is former congresswoman Kendra Horn. Mullin\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Oregon Republican nominee Jo Rae Perkins has been a vocal proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory, even posting a video of herself taking a QAnon oath in 2020. Perkins has also touted baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election \u2013 falsely proclaiming in December 2020 that \u201cthe Electoral College was stolen,\u201d calling for a recount in November 2020 to \u201c#StopCoupDeTat\u201d (sic), and posting on Facebook in 2021 to push false claims about how the election was supposedly rigged. When CNN asked Perkins for comment for this article in August, and informed her for fairness that we planned to mention that she has promoted false claims about the election being rigged against Trump, she responded in an email: \u201cI will not answer your questions since you already have a skewed opinion without talking to me directly. How do you know the claims are false?\u201d Perkins, a local Republican activist whose website says she has worked as a real estate agent, personal banker, financial advisor and insurance agent, was on the steps of the Capitol during the insurrection of January 6, 2021. She has said she does not support the people who broke into the building, did not go inside and was there in part as a \u201ccitizen journalist.\u201d Perkins lost congressional races in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020. She is now mounting a longshot effort to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen. Ron Wyden. Pennsylvania Republican nominee Mehmet Oz has very vaguely raised doubts about the 2020 election \u2013 declaring during the 2022 primary that \u201cthere are so many different things that happened\u201d and saying \u201cwe cannot move on.\u201d Asked by a Philadelphia talk radio host in March 2022 if Biden legitimately won Pennsylvania in 2020 (Biden did, by more than 80,000 votes), and if there was fraud (there was only a tiny amount of known fraud in Pennsylvania, some of it committed by Trump supporters), Oz ignored the first question and said, \u201cOh, there was definitely fraud.\u201d When the host asked Oz once more if he believes Biden legitimately won Pennsylvania, Oz dodged again and said: \u201cHe\u2019s the President.\u201d Oz has similarly avoided answering directly when asked if Biden was the legitimate winner of the 2020 election on the whole, answering that Biden is clearly the president. The Oz campaign stuck to that line in early September 2022 when CNN asked for Oz\u2019s position. (Oz has said, however, that he would have certified the election if he had been in the Senate on January 6, 2021, explaining that it isn\u2019t a senator\u2019s job at that point to question states\u2019 decisions.) Oz is running for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. His Democratic opponent is John Fetterman, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor. Incumbent Utah Sen. Mike Lee voted to certify Biden\u2019s electoral votes on January 6, 2021, saying in his floor speech that the only constitutional role for Congress was to open and count the electoral ballots. Two weeks later, Lee congratulated Biden on his inauguration as president. But Lee had previously tried to overturn Biden\u2019s victory. Text messages between Lee and then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, obtained by the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol and by CNN, show that Lee made extensive behind-the-scenes efforts, before January 6, to try to find a way to keep Trump in office. Lee pressed Meadows four days after Election Day to have the White House meet with attorney Sidney Powell and hear her \u201cstrategy to keep things alive and put several states back in play.\u201d Later in the month, Lee expressed concerns about Powell\u2019s wild claims. But on November 23, 2020, Lee promoted another lawyer who was trying to overturn the election, John Eastman, and also suggested an \u201caudit\u201d of ballots in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Michigan \u2013 baselessly claiming to Meadows that \u201csomething is not right in a few states.\u201d Then, on December 8, 2020, Lee floated the idea of states won by Biden appointing fake pro-Trump electors: \u201cIf a very small handful of states were to have their legislatures appoint alternative slates of delegates, there could be a path.\u201d On January 4, 2021, just two days before the congressional vote, Lee texted, \u201cWe need something from state legislatures to make this legitimate and to have any hope of winning.\u201d He also texted that he had been \u201ccalling state legislators for hours today\u201d and was \u201cgoing to spend hours doing the same tomorrow.\u201d Lee claimed to Utah\u2019s Deseret News in April 2022 that he did not urge state legislators during these phone calls to adopt alternate electors: \u201cAt no point in any of those was I engaging in advocacy. I wasn\u2019t in any way encouraging them to do that. I just asked them a yes or no question.\u201d In June 2022, Lee spoke supportively of a right-wing film that makes baseless claims of election fraud. He said the film \u201cdoes raise significant questions about what might have happened in that election\u201d and that, although Biden was legitimately chosen by the Electoral College, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that things didn\u2019t happen along the way.\u201d Lee\u2019s main opponent in the Senate race is independent candidate Evan McMullin. Lee\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Tiffany Smiley, a nurse and veterans\u2019 advocate, has questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election on her campaign website. The site\u2019s \u201cissues\u201d page claims that \u201cthe 2020 elections raised serious questions about the integrity of our elections and caused millions of Americans to question their confidence in our electoral process.\u201d (A redesign after Smiley won the Republican primary, previously reported by HuffPost, took the link to the \u201cissues\u201d page off of the site\u2019s main menu, replacing it with an \u201cagenda\u201d page that does not have an \u201celection integrity\u201d item at all.) Smiley campaign spokesperson Elisa Carlson claimed in an August email to CNN that \u201cTiffany\u2019s position has always been that Joe Biden is our duly elected President. However, she acknowledges that there are many who have concerns surrounding the 2020 election.\u201d But in a July interview with FOX 13 Seattle, before Smiley became the top Republican vote-getter in the state\u2019s top-two primary in August, Smiley would not answer directly when asked if Biden was \u201cduly elected.\u201d Smiley said instead: \u201cI live in reality. Joe Biden is \u2013 is our president.\u201d When CNN asked Carlson for evidence of Smiley having publicly said Biden was \u201cduly elected,\u201d Carlson did not provide any \u2013 instead sending along another interview in which Smiley also said \u201cJoe Biden is our president.\u201d And in a subsequent interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash in early September, Smiley would only answer confusingly when asked if Biden was legitimately elected, saying, \u201cYes Joe Biden is our president.\u201d (When Bash followed up by noting that Smiley didn\u2019t say Biden was legitimately elected, Smiley said, \u201cYes I think I made it clear: he is our president.\u201d) Smiley is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. Incumbent Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson played a role in the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in his state, though he maintains that his involvement was brief and insignificant. On January 6, 2021, the day Congress was to certify Biden\u2019s victory, an aide to Johnson texted an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the joint congressional session, to say that Johnson needed to hand Pence something, according to text messages disclosed by the House January 6 committee. When the Pence aide asked what it was, the Johnson aide said it was \u201calternate\u201d slates of electors \u2013 in other words, fake pro-Trump electors \u2013 for Wisconsin and Michigan, states actually won by Biden. Pence\u2019s aide told Johnson\u2019s aide not to hand that material to Pence, and Johnson\u2019s office did not do so; Johnson subsequently dismissed the situation as a \u201ccomplete non-story.\u201d But after Johnson claimed in June 2022 that he had been \u201cbasically unaware\u201d of the \u201cstaff-to-staff\u201d interaction with Pence\u2019s office, \u201cwasn\u2019t involved\u201d and \u201chad no knowledge of this,\u201d he acknowledged later the same week that he had personally connected his aide with a lawyer for the Trump campaign who was pushing the fake electors. In August 2022, Johnson again acknowledged the involvement he had initially denied but said his role was trivial. He told WISN 12 News: \u201cMy involvement in that attempt to deliver spanned the course of a couple seconds; I think I fielded three texts, and sent two, and talked to my chief of staff that somebody wants to deliver something.\u201d Johnson has been hard to pin down on the legitimacy of the 2020 election. In December 2020, he called the election legitimate and said that, although he soon planned to hold a Senate hearing on \u201cirregularities,\u201d he hadn\u2019t seen anything that would change the fact that Biden won. In early January 2021, though, he complained of \u201cso many irregularities,\u201d cited false allegations of tens of thousands of illegal votes in Nevada, and signed on to the joint statement, along with Kennedy, Lankford and other Republican senators, declaring his intention to reject certification of \u201cdisputed states.\u201d Johnson ended up changing his mind and approving certification after the January 6 riot at the Capitol, saying that things were different in light of what had just transpired. Months later, he was filmed telling an undercover liberal activist that there was \u201cnothing obviously skewed about the results\u201d in Wisconsin and that Trump lost merely because he got tens of thousands fewer votes than Republicans running for the state legislature \u2013 but he then went on to tell The Washington Post that he still thought there were \u201cmany\u201d unexplained \u201cirregularities\u201d in the election. Johnson spokesperson Alexa Henning said in an email last week: \u201cThe Senator accepted the results of the election over a year ago. As he has stated over and over, his goal with investigating election irregularities was to simply restore confidence in our election system by resolving suspicions with full transparency and public awareness. The Senator intended to transparently address the problem of the high level of public skepticism about the 2020 election.\u201d Johnson\u2019s Democratic opponent is Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. Update: This article has been updated to add comments made by Don Bolduc after he won the Republican nomination in New Hampshire.",

            "article_content": "They both worked for Donald Trump and have centered their congressional campaigns on the former President\u2019s policies. But in Tuesday\u2019s race to be the Republican nominee in New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District, Republicans Matt Mowers and Karoline Leavitt are in a bitter fight that is more about style than substance, one that has fractured Republican loyalties and highlighted how running on Trump\u2019s policies in a Republican primary is often not as potent as running like Trump himself. Mowers and Leavitt are seen as the top two candidates in a sprawling field of Republicans seeking to take on Rep. Chris Pappas, one of the most vulnerable House Democrats in the country. With election forecasters tempering their months-old predictions of an overwhelming red wave election for Republicans this November, operatives on the right are looking at targets like Pappas as must-wins if the GOP is going to win control of the chamber. \u201cWatching these two try to out-Trump each other, with Matt trying to walk a fine line between talking up his Trump administration bona fides while also preserving his electability in a general election\u2026 has allowed an opening for Leavitt, who is running as this pure Trump, election-denying candidate,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party who is voting for Russell Prescott, a former member of the New Hampshire Executive Council. Cullen said he won\u2019t vote for Leavitt if she wins the nomination \u2013 \u201cNew Hampshire doesn\u2019t need a Marjorie Taylor Greene or a Lauren Boebert representing us,\u201d he said \u2013 a feeling that highlights the fears about a Leavitt win. Recent polling shows the race is deadlocked. A Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire and released in late August found Mowers at 26% and Leavitt at 24%, within the survey\u2019s margin of error. A significant 26% of likely Republican primary voters were undecided. New Hampshire's GOP primary will complete the Senate battleground map Mowers\u2019 ties to New Hampshire go back to the 2014 election cycle, when he worked as the executive director of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee. In the 2016 cycle, Mowers initially worked for Chris Christie as the New Jersey governor sought the GOP presidential nomination. But when Christie\u2019s campaign failed, Mowers went to work for Trump\u2019s campaign and, after the Republican\u2019s victory, the State Department. Mowers, with Trump\u2019s backing, then unsuccessfully challenged Pappas in 2020. By comparison, Leavitt is more of a political newcomer. After graduating from Saint Anselm College in 2019, the Republican went to work in the Trump White House. She eventually became assistant press secretary under White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. After Trump\u2019s loss, she went to work for Rep. Elise Stefanik, now the third-ranking House Republican. Although Mowers is running on Trump-backed policy \u2013 his website blares \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d and has an entire page on \u201cElection Integrity\u201d \u2013 his style is more measured than the brand of politics that has defined Trump\u2019s orbit of political acolytes, a caution that has opened the door to the more aggressive Leavitt. Recent debates in the primary have highlighted these stylistic differences. Earlier this month, when Mowers was asked if he had confidence in elections, the candidate said, \u201cI have confidence in New Hampshire elections,\u201d but added that there was space to \u201cget better.\u201d That wasn\u2019t good enough for Leavitt, who lambasted Mowers and echoed Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. \u201cI consistently continue to be the only candidate in this race who said that I believe the 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump,\u201d Leavitt said, turning her attack on Mowers by noting that he voted twice in the 2016 primary and saying Mowers agrees with Joe Biden that the President \u201clegitimately won more votes than Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cI reject that,\u201d she says. These differences continued when asked whether Biden should be impeached. Leavitt was unequivocal. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, citing border security. Mowers was more cautious, calling for \u201chearings to look into these things.\u201d After the debate, which was hosted by WMUR, Leavitt put a finer point on her strategy: \u201cVoters are finally waking up to who Matt Mowers is. He is a go-along, get-along politician who cannot answer a straight question,\u201d she told the outlet. The race has divided House leadership, too. Reps. Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, the top two Republicans in the House, have both endorsed Mowers. Leavitt, in addition to Stefanik\u2019s support, also picked up endorsements from some of her party\u2019s more far right leaders, like Reps. Jim Jordan and Boebert. Money has flooded the race, with millions being spent to try to protect Mowers from a Leavitt surge. Congressional Leadership Fund, the predominant House Republican super PAC, has spent nearly $2 million defending Mowers. Defending Main Street, a centrist Republican super PAC, has spent $1.2 million with ads that say Leavitt \u201cpretends she is a conservative\u201d and call her \u201cwoke,\u201d \u201cimmature\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d Leavitt has responded to the outside spending with $285,000 of her own spending, including on an ad that attacks Mowers for voting in both New Hampshire an New Jersey during the 2016 primaries, accuses him of trying to \u201csabotage President Trump\u201d and labels him a \u201canother swamp doormat.\u201d How to follow primary elections in New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Delaware She has also tried to turn the deluge of money against her into an attack against Mowers, venting on Twitter that she was \u201cofficially the top target of DC\u2019s money machine\u201d because \u201cthe Establishment knows I am the greatest threat to their handpick puppet Matt Mowers.\u201d Democrats have watched the primary with a mix of trepidation, joy and concern. Collin Gately, a Pappas spokesperson, said the Republican primary has been dominated by \u201cextremism and ugliness\u201d and that none the candidates \u201chave a clue about how to help New Hampshire families, and voters will reject their extreme agenda.\u201d But even the most upbeat members of the party acknowledge that Pappas is vulnerable. Still, many believe that the contentious GOP primary \u2013 along with the fact that the race is concluding in September, less than two months before the general election \u2013 could help the New Hampshire Democrat win. Pappas has already begun distancing himself from Biden. The same University of New Hampshire poll found 54% of New Hampshire adults disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance, while 43% approved. In response to the President\u2019s plan to cancel some student loan debate, Pappas said it \u201cshould be more targeted and paid for so it doesn\u2019t add to the deficit.\u201d And he knocked Biden\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s following as \u201csemi-fascist\u201d days before the primary, telling reporters that Biden \u201chas to be careful not to paint with too broad of a brush.\u201d Mowers is married to a senior video producer at CNN. CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon pleaded not guilty Thursday in a New York court to state charges of money laundering, conspiracy and fraud related to an alleged online scheme to raise money for the construction of a wall along the southern US border, according to his attorney. The state charges are based on the same conduct Bannon was charged with by federal prosecutors in 2020 that alleged he and three others had defrauded donors in the border wall effort, which raised more than $15 million. He was later pardoned by Trump. Presidential pardons do not apply to state investigations, however. Handcuffed and flanked by officers as they walked past reporters into court, Bannon said, \u201cThis is what happens in the last days of a dying regime. They will never shut me up, they\u2019ll have to kill me first. I have not yet begun to fight.\u201d According to the indictment, one of Bannon\u2019s associates who isn\u2019t named created an online fundraising platform to raise money to build a wall on the border. In order to receive the money from donors, the organizer promised that \u201c100% of the funds\u201d would go towards building a border wall, and he would not be taking a salary from the project, prosecutors say. Bannon\u2019s associates discussed telling the public that no one involved in the \u201cWe Build The Wall\u201d project would take a salary, according to the indictment. In a text message, one of the associates told Bannon that the claim \u201cremoves all self interest taint on this\u201d and it \u201cgives [the CEO] saint hood,\u201d the indictment says. Bannon publicly claimed he was acting \u201ckind of as a volunteer\u201d for We Build The Wall, prosecutors said in the indictment. Behind the scenes, Bannon allegedly helped to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to himself and his associates. \u201cToday is an important day for justice,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said when announcing the charges alongside Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. James said everyday Americans play by the rules, but powerful, politically connected people think they\u2019re above the law. \u201cSteve Bannon stands out as a perfect example of this blatant inequality,\u201d James said. Bannon appeared to blame his situation on political motivations. \u201cThis an irony, on the very day the mayor of this city has a delegation down on the border, they are persecuting people here, that try to stop them at the border\u201d he told reporters outside the DA\u2019s office Thursday. \u201cThis is all about 60 days from the day,\u201d he said later, referencing the November election. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office launched a criminal investigation into Bannon\u2019s \u201cWe Build the Wall\u201d crowd-fundraising activities early last year after then-President Trump pardoned Bannon on federal fraud charges relating to the same alleged scheme. Bannon had been federally charged with diverting more than $1 million to pay an alleged co-conspirator and cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal expenses. Prosecutors alleged that the donors, including some in New York, were falsely told that all the money contributed would go toward the construction effort. In recent months, several people close to Bannon were brought before the state grand jury. Manhattan prosecutors subpoenaed bank records and quietly worked on the investigation over the past year as they investigated Trump and his real estate business, sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN. But the district attorney\u2019s office deferred a charging decision on Bannon until federal prosecutors concluded their case against his three co-defendants, who were not pardoned. Steve Bannon's request for a new trial is rejected by federal judge Bannon issued a statement late Tuesday, in part calling the indictment \u201cphony charges\u201d and \u201cnothing more than a partisan political weaponization of the criminal justice system.\u201d \u201cI am proud to be a leading voice on protecting our borders and building a wall to keep our country safe from drugs and violent criminals,\u201d he said in the statement, adding: \u201cThey are coming after all of us, not only President Trump and myself. I am never going to stop fighting. In fact, I have not yet begun to fight. They will have to kill me first.\u201d A federal jury in July found Bannon guilty of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. He is scheduled to be sentenced in October and faces a minimum sentence of 30 days in jail, according to federal law. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Summer is nearly over. Primaries are mostly done. The sprint to Election Day is here. With just two months before voters decide which party will control the House and Senate, there\u2019s good news for Democrats on multiple fronts. Plus, there\u2019s new CNN reporting on Republicans in Washington worried about fundraising, infighting about strategy and concerned about the candidates who have won heavily contested primaries. But! For now, the bottom line for 2022 is still that the history and the math are very complicated for Democrats. Republicans could do almost everything wrong and still walk away with a House majority, and maybe a Senate majority to boot. Here\u2019s the evidence. The end of federally guaranteed abortion rights for American women could mobilize voters. Democrats can point to some key wins in Congress \u2013 like a bipartisan infrastructure law that shows they can work across party lines and a climate change package that is a down payment on getting the country off of oil. A targeted student loan forgiveness plan unveiled by President Joe Biden will help many of the Americans who feel crushed by college debt. Democrats still plan to push on Capitol Hill for votes to codify abortion rights and same-sex marriage rights into law, although neither may have the support to break a GOP filibuster in the Senate. The FBI search of Mar-a-Lago and ensuing legal battle between former President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice has been a distraction and a reminder of the chaos of the Trump years. Plus, Republican party dons are frustrated with GOP candidates in some key Senate races. Chiefly, inflation continues to make American life much more expensive, and there\u2019s little Biden or Democratic majorities in the House and Senate can do about it. Gas prices, a key barometer, have fallen but are still about $1.50 per gallon higher than they were when Biden took office. Plus, the Federal Reserve\u2019s cure for inflation \u2013 higher interest rates \u2013 will likely lead to a higher unemployment rate, which won\u2019t necessarily make regular people feel better about the economy, even if it causes economists to breathe a sigh of relief. The student loan debt cancellation has caused some frustration about a moral hazard since even some doctors and lawyers will see some of their debt forgiven. It\u2019s also caused anger among those who already paid off their debts or went to work rather than to college. And a flood of migrants at the border could motivate Republican voters as criticism of the Biden administration mounts. I\u2019ve mentioned this before, but it bears repeating that it\u2019s extremely rare for the president\u2019s party to gain ground in a midterm election. Here\u2019s what I wrote in a What Matters edition from late August about how the abortion issue has energized Democrats: Since World War II, the president\u2019s party has lost seats, often a lot of them, in every midterm election but two \u2013 in 1998 after Bill Clinton was impeached and in 2002 in the run-up to the war in Iraq. If 2022 is added to that list, the extraneous circumstance would have to be the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn guaranteed abortion rights in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade. This year, Democrats don\u2019t have to lose a lot to lose control of the House and Senate. Republicans need to pick up a net total of five seats in the 435-member House of Representatives. The website Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales tracks House and Senate races and it currently thinks there are 169 solid Democratic seats in the House compared with 188 solid Republican seats. Of the \u201cseats in play,\u201d 54 are held by Democrats, 21 are held by Republicans and three seats are up for grabs as they aren\u2019t currently controlled by either party because of redistricting. That means Democrats are essentially on defense in the House. Republicans are belatedly working to give voters something to vote for rather than simply present an alternative to Democrats. In a riff on the \u201cContract with America\u201d that helped the GOP take control of the House after the 1994 elections, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy will unveil a \u201cCommitment to America\u201d in Pittsburgh on September 19, according to Axios. The platform will focus on reducing government spending, securing the border, protecting freedoms like speech and holding government accountable. That last point is an obvious push to use a congressional majority, should they win, to investigate the Biden administration and push for \u201csafe and fair elections.\u201d In the Senate, Republicans need a net gain of just one seat, but with only a handful of truly competitive seats, that could still be a tall order. CNN\u2019s Simone Pathe is out with her semiregular must-read, \u201cThe 10 Senate seats mostly likely to flip in 2022.\u201d The competitive field is evenly split. Pathe has five GOP-held and five Democrat-held seats on her list. At the top of her list of seats that could flip is the increasingly rancorous Senate race in Pennsylvania, where the celebrity candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz has been criticizing the health of the Democratic candidate: the tattooed, hoodie-wearing Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. In an interview with Politico on Wednesday, Fetterman committed to debate Oz, though he declined to provide specifics. Another major concern for Republicans is a growing Democratic fundraising lead. Money helps candidates (and their allies) put their message on the TV screens and in the mailboxes of voters and can be a barometer of the excitement a candidate generates. Democrats are trouncing Republican candidates who should be doing better at raising cash, as was pointed out with an eye-popping graphic on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics.\u201d In particular, Ohio is a state that has trended Republican in recent years at the state and presidential level but could end up with two Democratic senators come January, if Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan\u2019s $22 million compared with Republican rookie candidate J.D. Vance\u2019s $3.5 million is an indication. In Arizona, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has raised $54 million compared with Republican candidate Blake Masters\u2019 $5 million! And in Georgia, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock has brought in $85 million compared with Republican candidate Herschel Walker\u2019s $20 million. Note: As CNN\u2019s Nia-Malika Henderson pointed out, what ties so many of these Republican candidates is two things: My question: Does that mean insiders are in this year? Can\u2019t wait to find out in November. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Alex Rogers have reported on the dustup among the GOP party bigwigs in Washington, where there\u2019s frustration that a hands-off approach by Florida\u2019s Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has led to poor \u201ccandidate quality\u201d \u2013 to borrow Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s phrasing \u2013 and fundraising problems. Read more. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza points out that Scott and McConnell have repeatedly \u201cbutted heads\u201d and notes that Scott pushed back in an op-ed in the Washington Examiner last week. Scott didn\u2019t exactly call McConnell a treasonous coward, but who else could he have been talking about? \u201cUnfortunately, many of the very people responsible for losing the Senate last cycle are now trying to stop us from winning the majority this time by trash-talking our Republican candidates,\u201d wrote Scott. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing act of cowardice, and ultimately, it\u2019s treasonous to the conservative cause.\u201d Read more from Cillizza. All of that will be forgotten if Republicans can eke out five House seats and one Senate seat. History is on their side, even if the political winds are not as favorable, at least right now.",

            "article_content": "Lindsey Graham knows of what he speaks when he speaks of Donald Trump. Despite starting out as one of the former President\u2019s most vehement critics, the South Carolina Republican senator has transformed into one of Trump\u2019s closest allies in Congress. How did he do it? By understanding the psyche of Trump \u2013 knowing what makes the billionaire businessman tick. All of which is why it\u2019s worth paying attention when Graham talks publicly about what he has been telling Trump in private \u2013 as he did in a recent CNBC interview. \u201cI\u2019m literally telling you what I tell him,\u201d said Graham. \u201cIf you lose again, the history about who you are and what you did dramatically changes. If you come back, it will be one of the greatest political comebacks in American history. And if you get four more years, you can do big stuff.\u201d Remember this: Trump is, at heart, a reality TV producer. He\u2019s forever focused on storylines and narratives \u2013 always looking for compelling angles and people. (Part of how he decided on who would make up his original Cabinet was whether they looked the part.) What Graham is selling Trump on then is just such a storyline \u2013 the idea of the former President as the comeback kid. The guy whom voters regretted getting rid of four years prior and now have a chance to right that wrong. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Again, here\u2019s Graham channeling Trump during the CNBC interview: \u201cRemember me? I may not be your cup of tea, but when I was President, our border was secure, we had the lowest illegal crossings in 40 years. I did it.\u201d It\u2019s an argument that will be compelling to Trump. He is \u2013 and has always been \u2013 deeply invested in the idea of second chances. In 2006 when Tara Conner, who had won the Miss USA crown, was rumored to have been spotted drinking in bars when she was underage, Trump refused to strip her of the crown. (Trump owned the Miss USA event.) \u201cI\u2019ve always been a believer in second chances,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cShe left a small town in Kentucky and she was telling me that she got caught up in the whirlwind of New York. It\u2019s a story that has happened many times before to many women and many men who came to the Big Apple. They wanted their slice of the Big Apple and they found out it wasn\u2019t so easy.\u201d While in the White House, Trump signed the First Step Act, a prison reform measure that afforded second chances to people who had been previously incarcerated. \u201cWe believe that every person has unbound potential,\u201d Trump said in 2020 of the law. \u201cIt is therefore important that we offer former inmates who have served their sentences and learned from their earlier mistakes the opportunity for redemption through a second chance to become productive members of society.\u201d There is, of course, one rather large problem with Graham\u2019s whole comeback kid narrative: Trump is still refusing to admit that he lost the 2020 election. \u201cNow that the FBI and DOJ have been caught in a massive and determinative Election Rigging Scam, are they going to change the results of the 2020 presidential election?\u201d Trump asked on Monday via his Truth Social website. \u201cThey should!!!\u201d It\u2019s, of course, hard to make a comeback when you can\u2019t admit that you lost in the first place. But, directionally at least, Graham is right about the shape that a Trump 2024 bid would likely take. It would be a sort of I-told-you-so message, hoping that there is enough buyer\u2019s remorse among people who voted for Joe Biden to put Trump back in office.",

            "article_content": "The man in charge of the House GOP\u2019s campaign strategy has been doling out advice to Republican candidates and incumbents in key battleground races as they prepare for the general election: Don\u2019t be distracted by Donald Trump on the campaign trail, and instead focus on the issues Republicans believe will be most salient to voters in the midterms. The guidance from Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, relayed by three GOP sources familiar with the internal conversations, reflects a tacit acknowledgment among Republican leaders that the former president could knock the GOP\u2019s midterm messaging off course as they seek to recapture the House majority this fall. It also represents a shift from the strategy deployed in many Republican primaries, where embracing Trump \u2013 or at least not alienating him and his base \u2013 was seen as essential to survival. The dynamic that House Republicans are now grappling with underscores the continued challenge Trump\u2019s influence over the GOP poses for the party \u2013 a challenge that will only intensify if the former President decides once again to run for the White House in 2024. \u201cTom Emmer, and I think Kevin (McCarthy) and Steve (Scalise), are all saying we should be focusing on the issues \u2013 and they\u2019re right,\u201d said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who represents a Biden-won district and faces a competitive re-election race this fall. \u201cOur focus should be on 2022. If it\u2019s 2024, it hurts us. .. We need to be focused on winning this November, and I think anything that takes your eyes off that, it could cost us a couple of victories.\u201d A spokesman for Emmer said the National Republican Congressional Committee chairman has indeed counseled candidates to focus on the issues that matter to voters, like inflation, crime and the border, but emphasized that Trump is not on the ballot this fall and therefore has not been a focus during their strategy discussions. \u201cCandidates know their districts best,\u201d said NRCC communications director Michael McAdams. \u201cPublic and private polls show the midterms will be a referendum on Joe Biden and Democrats\u2019 failed agenda that\u2019s left voters paying record prices, dealing with soaring violent crime and facing billions in middle-class tax hikes.\u201d But Emmer\u2019s recommendation may be increasingly tough to follow, especially if Trump announces a presidential run before the midterms \u2013 something Republican leaders, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, are desperate to avoid. GOP leaders want the midterms to be a referendum on President Joe Biden and the Democrats, not Trump, even though the former president relishes in being the topic of conversation. Meanwhile, the recent FBI search on Mar-a-Lago related to the retention of classified documents has been like rocket fuel for the GOP\u2019s base, prompting a surge in fundraising and rallying Republicans to Trump\u2019s side. But it has also posed a dilemma for some GOP lawmakers, who are wrestling with how much to invoke Trump back in battleground districts now that they are looking ahead to the general election, where appealing to moderate and suburban voters is crucial. McCarthy \u2013 who has been barnstorming the country this month in his quest to raise cash and win back the majority \u2013 told CNN before the recess break that he sees Trump as integral to their efforts to recapture the House, and has tightly hugged the ex-president in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. But he still believes Trump should wait until after the midterms to launch any presidential bid, wanting to keep a laser-focus on 2022. However, McCarthy dismissed the idea the upcoming election will be anything but an indictment on the party in power. \u201cThe No. 1 thing that (Trump) wants, and America wants, is to put this economy back on track,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe real question is, are you better off than you were two years ago? Does a car cost more? Does your gas cost more? Does your food cost more?\u201d While embracing Trump proved to be a beneficial strategy in Republican primaries, multiple Republicans in battleground districts told CNN they try to avoid talking about Trump on the campaign trail as they seek to appeal to moderate and suburban swing voters this fall, some of whom were turned off by Trump but are unhappy with Biden\u2019s handling of the economy. One lawmaker said they only mention the former president when directly asked about him, another member said they try to focus on highlighting Trump\u2019s policies and legislative achievements, and a third said they try not to get dragged into the daily Trump maelstrom. \u201cI don\u2019t say his name, ever. I just avoid saying his name generally,\u201d said one of the GOP lawmakers in a competitive race. \u201cI talk about the policies of his that I like.\u201d Republicans are banking on Biden\u2019s low approval ratings, historical trends, and the still high \u2013 though decreasing \u2013 cost of goods and gas prices to deliver them the majority. In the House, Republicans only need to net five seats to seize the lower chamber. In the coming weeks, McCarthy is planning to roll out a formal policy agenda for his conference. Last year, he tapped seven task forces to start sketching out a legislative agenda for if Republicans recapture the majority, with the goal of releasing a document before the end of this summer that members can run on in the fall. But Trump \u2013 who has criminal, civil and congressional investigations swirling around him \u2013 remains a looming presence in the party who is threatening to overshadow the GOP\u2019s preferred talking points and policy goals. And after the FBI search, even some of Trump\u2019s Republican doubters have felt compelled to publicly defend him, cognizant of how the episode has fired up the base. Across the Capitol, there\u2019s also been some apprehension about hinging campaigns too tightly on Trump. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 who cut ties with Trump after January 6 \u2013 expressed frustration this week over some of the Trump-backed nominees who have struggled in their general election campaigns, and warned that the battle for control of the Senate is going to be \u201cextremely close.\u201d \u201cI think there\u2019s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate,\u201d McConnell said this week at an event in Kentucky. \u201cSenate races are just different. They\u2019re statewide,\u201d he added. \u201cCandidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, are practically salivating at the prospect of Trump declaring an early bid for president. They have coalesced around a midterm message that attempts to paint all Republicans as \u201cultra MAGA\u201d extremists who are blindly loyal to Trump. \u201cWe will remind voters that while we fight to lower costs and build an economy that works for everyone, MAGA Republicans are hellbent on attacking women\u2019s freedom,\u201d the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a recent memo. \u201cThe data and voters of every background are overwhelmingly clear that Democrats are with the American people on this issue. Our position puts us closer to holding the House majority in November.\u201d But there are plenty of Republicans in conservative districts who have happily centered their campaigns around Trump and embraced the role of Trump acolyte, including House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, who said she was \u201cproud\u201d to be considered an ultra MAGA Republican. And while Emmer has privately implored certain candidates to avoid Trump talk on the campaign trail, the NRCC has invoked his name to fundraise and invited Trump to be the keynote speaker at fundraising events \u2013 a sign that he is still a powerful and energizing force in certain corners of the party. But that\u2019s why lawmakers say Emmer has not taken a \u201cone-size fits all\u201d approach to their midterm campaign strategy. \u201cHe has shown a balanced approach with people. He\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all guy. That\u2019s what I appreciate,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cHe measures each district and takes it from there.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Harriet Hageman proudly wears Wyoming on her sleeve \u2013 and wields it like a hammer against Liz Cheney. \u201cI know Wyoming. I love Wyoming. I am Wyoming,\u201d Hageman tells audiences as she travels across her state, entering the closing days of a bitter Republican duel in one of the highest-profile congressional races in the country. \u201cI am going to reclaim Wyoming\u2019s lone congressional seat from that Virginian who currently holds it,\u201d Hageman likes to say, casting aside the Cheney family\u2019s deep roots in the state and suggesting the three-term congresswoman is more at home in the Washington suburbs. These days, signs of trouble for Cheney are easy to spot here in Wyoming. Hageman holds a commanding lead in the final weekend of a primary election that stands as yet another reminder of the Republican Party\u2019s evolution in the era of Donald Trump. A University of Wyoming poll released this week found that Cheney is trailing Hageman by 29 points. Yet one question looming over the Republican primary is how many Democrats and independents will switch parties and vote for Cheney, which even her supporters acknowledge is her only chance to stay competitive. Cheney tries to hold on in tough Wyoming primary reshaped by Trump \u201cIf it\u2019s a big Republican vote, there aren\u2019t enough Democrats to change it, even if we all crossed over,\u201d former Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan said in an interview Friday, noting that he is among the Democrats who have temporarily switched parties to support Cheney. \u201cOut of honor and respect for her leadership, I cast my vote her way.\u201d The venom in the Cheney-Hageman race comes alive in conversations with voters, dueling television ads and reports of stolen yard signs. Their relationship wasn\u2019t always acrimonious, when Hageman stood alongside Cheney and showered her with praise during Cheney\u2019s first bid for Congress in 2016. \u201cI am proud to introduce my friend Liz Cheney,\u201d Hageman said then. \u201cI know Liz Cheney is a proven, courageous, constitutional conservative, someone who has the education, the background and experience to fight effectively for Wyoming on a national stage.\u201d Today, that national stage is starkly different than it was six years ago, back when Cheney and Trump were elected on the same day. Now, the former President is at the center of her political fall in a state where he won 70% of the vote, his widest margin anywhere. He traveled to Wyoming three months ago to put his stamp on the race. \u201cLiz, you\u2019re fired,\u201d Trump told thousands of admirers at a rally in Casper. \u201cWyoming deserves a congresswoman who stands up for you and your values, not one who spends all of her time putting you down and going after your president in the most vicious way possible.\u201d Yet here in Wyoming, Hageman is seen as far more than Trump\u2019s hand-picked candidate. She grew up on her family\u2019s small ranch near Fort Laramie, population 207, not far from the state\u2019s border with Nebraska. Long before her fight with Cheney, Hageman gained prominence as a natural resources attorney, specializing on cases protecting the state\u2019s water, public lands and agriculture. \u201cOne of the things, I think, we need to do is make the federal government largely irrelevant to our everyday lives,\u201d Hageman told voters this week during a stop at the Rock Springs Chamber of Commerce luncheon, highlighting decades of legal work fighting against such policies as protecting gray wolves under the Endangered Species Act and broader plans of national forest conservation. Hageman, 59, spent most of her career doing this work at her own law firm in Cheyenne. But now, she is a senior litigation counsel for the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a group based in Washington that battles environmental regulations, taxes, campaign finance restrictions and far more. She has spent much of the last year driving around the state to build a campaign against Cheney, telling voters that she\u2019s traveled about 40,000 miles since announcing her campaign nearly a year ago. Yet in the final week of the primary here, she had no public campaign events, rather meeting privately with groups. Hageman declined to answer questions when CNN caught up with her in Rock Springs, a coal mining town in the southwestern part of the state, saying only: \u201cThis race is about Wyoming, nothing else.\u201d The race, of course, has become about far more. But several Wyoming voters this week said they appreciated the attention Hageman was devoting to energy, agriculture and other issues of direct importance to the state. \u201cWe voted for Harriet,\u201d said Scott Vetter of Carpenter, who works in agriculture sales. \u201cWhen you dive into the work that she\u2019s done, it\u2019s been stellar. She\u2019s close to agriculture, which is our bread and butter, and what we do to make a living.\u201d He said he and his wife voted early, insisting it wasn\u2019t a knock against Cheney, but an affirmative vote for Hageman and her intense focus on Wyoming issues. He said Trump\u2019s endorsement was not the decisive factor in his decision. \u201cWe\u2019re not Trump lovers, but we\u2019re not Trump haters,\u201d Vetter said, talking during the Laramie County Fair. \u201cWe just want to get the country moving again. I would say Harriet had our votes from the beginning.\u201d Hageman made an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2018. Even though she placed third in the Republican primary, the race elevated her profile across Wyoming. She went on to represent the state on the Republican National Committee, a position she resigned when she announced her campaign to challenge Cheney last year. Hageman has sought to capitalize on the anger among Trump loyalists \u2013 much of which is directed at Cheney and her leading role in the Congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. \u201cWe\u2019re fed up with the January 6 commission and those who think they can gaslight us,\u201d Hageman told a cheering crowd at the Trump rally in Casper in May. \u201cAnd we\u2019re fed up with Liz Cheney.\u201d For her part, Hageman has wavered about the outcome of the 2020 election. If Cheney loses her primary, Trump's GOP critics will face tough choice During a contentious debate in June, Cheney pressed her rival, saying: \u201cI think that she can\u2019t say that it wasn\u2019t stolen because she\u2019s completely beholden to Donald Trump. And if she says it wasn\u2019t stolen, he will not support her.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until last week, during a campaign stop in Casper, that Hageman fully embraced the former President\u2019s baseless election denial rhetoric. \u201cAbsolutely the election was rigged,\u201d Hageman said. \u201cIt was rigged to make sure that President Trump could not get reelected.\u201d What Hageman doesn\u2019t tell her audiences is that she once opposed Trump \u2013 and supported Ted Cruz in 2016. She was among the final wave of Republicans hoping to block Trump from clinching the party\u2019s nomination at the GOP convention in Cleveland. It\u2019s a sign of her own transformation \u2013 from Cheney ally to Trump loyalist \u2013 with her sights now set on Washington. \u201cI will be taking that fight to DC,\u201d Hageman said, \u201cjust as soon as I defeat Liz Cheney.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Primaries in the Upper Midwest on Tuesday will set the stage for two major governor\u2019s races, as Republicans in Wisconsin and Minnesota select their nominees to take on those states\u2019 Democratic incumbents in November. Minnesota is also set to fill a House seat after former GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn died in February. Meanwhile, in Vermont, Rep. Peter Welch is running to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, which opens up the state\u2019s lone House seat. The state\u2019s lieutenant governor and its Senate president pro tempore \u2013 both Democrats \u2013 are vying to become the first woman to ever represent Vermont in Congress. Heavily Democratic Connecticut is also holding primaries on Tuesday, with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Gov. Ned Lamont up for reelection this fall. Here are five things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s primaries: The proxy battle over the future of the Republican Party between former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence continues Tuesday in Wisconsin, where a Pence-endorsed establishment favorite faces off against a Trump-backed outsider in a state where he has falsely claimed the 2020 election results were fraudulent. Wisconsin's GOP gubernatorial primary tests Trump's influence amid political fallout of FBI search It\u2019s a replay of similar gubernatorial primaries in recent weeks in Arizona, where Trump\u2019s candidate won last week, and Georgia, where the Pence-backed Gov. Brian Kemp fended off a Trump-aligned challenger. In Wisconsin, former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch entered the race as the GOP\u2019s heir apparent in a battleground state long dominated by former Gov. Scott Walker. She spent eight years as Walker\u2019s No. 2, and is backed by Pence and other establishment Republicans. But then construction company owner Tim Michels entered the race, fueled by millions of dollars of his own wealth and a key endorsement. He is campaigning as an outsider, with Trump\u2019s help; the former President at a recent rally said Kleefisch is \u201cthe handpicked candidate of the failed establishment, the RINOs.\u201d Both have embraced Trump\u2019s lies about fraud in the 2020 election. Kleefisch called the 2020 election \u201crigged,\u201d but said she would not attempt to decertify its results because it is not legally possible to do so. Michels, however, said in a debate that \u201ceverything is on the table,\u201d indicating he would entertain measures that would seek to decertify President Joe Biden\u2019s victory in Wisconsin. The winner of the primary will take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who is seeking a second term in what\u2019s expected to be one of the nation\u2019s most competitive gubernatorial contests this fall. Another race to watch in Wisconsin is Assembly Speaker Robin Vos\u2019 primary against little-known Adam Steen, who was endorsed by Trump after the former President decided Vos \u2013 a powerful Republican who had tried to appease Trump by hiring a former state Supreme Court justice to investigate the 2020 election \u2013 had done too little to try to overturn Wisconsin\u2019s results. Vos said last month the former President had called him the week before as part of a fresh effort to decertify the state\u2019s 2020 results. Two weeks ago, the Democratic Senate primary in Wisconsin was arguably the most closely watched primary contest on the left, pitting Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes against Alex Lasry, the Milwaukee Bucks executive who spent over $12 million of his own money on his campaign; Wisconsin state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski; and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. And then it wasn\u2019t. 'Out of touch': Wisconsin's Barnes and Johnson prepare for general election campaign defined by attacks After internal polls showed Barnes\u2019 lead over his opponents growing, all three bowed out in the span of a few days, with Nelson, Lasry and Godlewski all endorsing the lieutenant governor. \u201cI could not have imagined it ending up this way,\u201d Barnes told CNN. \u201cTo me, it shows just how important beating Ron Johnson is, just how important expanding the Democratic majority is.\u201d The consolidation means Barnes and Democrats can pivot earlier to their end goal: defeating Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in November. Johnson, who opted to run for a third term after pledging in 2016 that his second term would be his last, has drawn Democratic ire for a host of comments on the coronavirus, the January 6, 2021, attack, and his personal wealth. But he has proven resilient in the past, ensuring that the Senate race in Wisconsin will be one of the closest watched contests of the 2022 cycle. Voters in Southern Minnesota will select a new congressman on Tuesday after Rep. Jim Hagedorn died in February from kidney cancer. The special election, which comes at the same time Minnesota voters will vote in the regular 2022 primary, pits Republican Brad Finstad, the former head of USDA Rural Development for Minnesota, against Democrat Jeffrey Ettinger, who previously worked as CEO of Hormel Foods. The district, which stretches across Minnesota\u2019s entire Southern border, leans toward Republicans. While voters select their congressman in the special election, they will also vote in the general election primary, selecting which candidates will get the chance to try to represent the district for a full term starting in 2023. Finstad and Ettinger are candidates in that race, as well. There are other contests worth watching in Minnesota, including well-funded challenges to incumbents. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar is being challenged by former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels, while Rep. Betty McCollum is facing a challenge from progressive Amane Badhasso. Vermont is the only state to never send a woman to represent it in Congress \u2013 a distinction that, barring a major upset in November, is soon to change. On Tuesday, Democrats are likely to choose between state Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint and Lt. Gov. Molly Gray to be their nominee for the state\u2019s lone House seat. (Physician Louis Meyers, the only man on the ballot, is expected to finish a distant third.) Vermont Democrats face historic decision in open-seat House primary Balint, endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and other leading national progressives, is the left\u2019s choice. Gray, meanwhile, has the unofficial backing of retiring Sen. Pat Leahy, who donated to her campaign through his PAC and said he voted for her. Leahy\u2019s wife, Marcelle Leahy, formally endorsed Gray. Though there is very little room between Gray and Balint on the issues, Balint, who is gay, has been boosted by big spending from the LGBTQ Victory Fund\u2019s PAC \u2013 which has spent nearly $1 million on the race \u2013 and the campaign arm of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Recent polling of the race has shown Balint with a commanding lead, but some observers expect the final tally to be much closer. If Balint wins a close race, the decision by state Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale to end her campaign and endorse Balint \u2013 in a bid to consolidate the left \u2013 could loom large. Another high-stakes race for control of state governments in the Upper Midwest will come into clearer focus on Tuesday, as Minnesota Republicans choose their nominee for governor. The state party has already made its selection, endorsing Scott Jensen, a doctor and former state senator. Jensen is the overwhelming favorite in a GOP contest with Joyce Lynne Lacey and Bob \u201cAgain\u201d Carney Jr. Jensen is a fierce critic of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz\u2019s initial Covid-19 response and, at a recent forum, called the incumbent\u2019s mitigation measures at the beginning of the pandemic an \u201cabomination of government overreach.\u201d Jensen\u2019s past remarks downplaying Covid, including a past assertion that hospitals were inflating the number of cases to collect more stimulus money, was cited in PolitiFact\u2019s post on its 2020 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d He also touted his unvaccinated status over the past year as he rose to greater political prominence, sowing doubts over the safety and efficacy of the shots. Jensen has also been an outspoken critic of abortion, an issue that is certain to be at the forefront of Democratic efforts to define him as too extreme after abortion rights supporters scored a notable victory in Kansas earlier this month. Jensen appeared to soften his position on abortion in late July, saying in a taped video that he supports allowing abortions for victims of rape or incest or if the life of the mother is threatened. He told Minnesota Public Radio in March that he would \u201ctry to ban abortion\u201d as governor. Walz has been attacking Jensen\u2019s abortion stance for weeks, framing the general election as a referendum on the issue. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a nuanced position between myself and my opponent,\u201d Walz said in June. \u201cThis is far as the Grand Canyon could be in how we view women and how we view health care.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.",

            "article_content": "If the US House soon passes the Senate\u2019s landmark climate change and health care bill, it will help validate the Democrats\u2019 monopoly on political power in Washington and hand Joe Biden a notable presidential legacy ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections. The measure finally squeezed through the Senate after an exhausting and dramatic round-the-clock marathon that stretched into Sunday afternoon \u2013 a major breakthrough following months of Democratic infighting that gouged deep divides in the party. The Inflation Reduction Act may not live up to its name and cut the cost of living. It dashed some big dreams of progressives who wanted it to do more. And its final passage may come too late to save Democrats in the midterms. But it\u2019s still an enormous win for the party that seemed impossible just weeks ago. What's in the Manchin-Schumer deal on climate, health care and taxes In a goal Democrats have been chasing for decades, the legislation will for the first time give Medicare the power to negotiate the cost of a limited basket of prescription drugs, thereby bringing down costs. In extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, it could save health care coverage for countless people. And in spending nearly $370 billion to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change, it goes most of the way to reaching Biden\u2019s ambitious plans to create a clean energy economy. The bill could also help revive US global leadership in the quest to save the planet by prodding other nations to follow suit. The victory is all the more remarkable since it was achieved against vehement GOP opposition in the 50-50 Senate, where Democrats had no room for error. Democrats spent months negotiating with themselves, as moderate senators like West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema extracted concessions that progressives had little choice but to accept to save the bill. Coal state senator Manchin revived the measure after reversing his opposition late last month and agreeing to a clean energy push in return for concessions on fossil fuels. At times, Biden was in the weeds trying to get this major chunk of his domestic agenda enacted. The credibility of his presidency depended on overcoming the obstacles to significant economy-changing legislation. But in recent weeks, saddled by plunging approval ratings, he let the Senate work its will and accepted a final result that fell far short of his original aspirations for a Franklin Roosevelt-style transformation. The Senate finally passed it, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie, shortly after Biden emerged from the White House from his second Covid isolation. All major new laws are judged in multiple ways \u2013 on their impact on the lives of Americans, on how they shift the political environment and how they appear in retrospect, many years down the road, in history\u2019s ledger. So even if Democrats\u2019 achievement may not be rewarded at the ballot box anytime soon, it might not go without notice in the long term. Climate hawks breathe sigh of relief after more than a decade of fighting for climate legislation If, as expected, this bill is passed along party lines in the House this week, its real world impact will be measured in whether it lives up to Democratic claims that it will slash carbon emissions at a time when the deadly effects of climate change \u2013 seen in extreme floods, droughts and wildfires \u2013 are becoming ever more obvious. The party and the White House also say the bill could have a massive human impact by helping elderly Americans struggling to pay for certain vital medicines and create real quality of life improvements for millions. And in extending Obamacare subsidies, this measure would lock in and prolong one of the greatest achievements of Democratic rule in the 21st century. Democrats lose effort to cap insulin at $35 for most Americans before passage of Senate reconciliation bill Then there are electoral reverberations from the passage of a bill that, like most legislation, will take months and years to be fully implemented and so could lack immediate, transformative political after-effects. It\u2019s unclear whether this push, which will enshrine a major piece of Biden\u2019s agenda, will rescue the President\u2019s fast diminishing political fortunes. His approval rating, which has dipped below 40%, threatens to drag down Democrats and smash their hold on power in Washington in November. Democrats have faced a savage political storm for much of this year, as a nation exhausted by the pandemic has faced soaring gas and grocery prices. This legislative achievement could at least gives them a chance to reengage with their voters, some of whom have given the President poor marks, according to recent polls. Democrats can argue they have made the most sweeping investments in combating climate change in history, an important consideration for generations \u2013 and especially young voters, who will live with a warming planet. \u201cThis is an absolute historic investment in climate change,\u201d White House Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown Sunday, touting the measure\u2019s impact on fostering clean energy, growing jobs and saving consumers money. To get older voters to the polls, meanwhile, Democrats can stress drug price cuts now that Medicare will have some negotiating power. Taken together with the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of the constitutional right to abortion and a recent easing of gasoline prices, Democrats have reason to hope their voters will turn out this fall. Driving base voters to the polls may not save the House, which many election analysts believe is heading to the GOP. But it could play into the critical handful of races that will decide the control of the Senate, where Republicans need to gain just one seat to win the majority. 'I believe Roe got it right': Biden signs executive order to safeguard abortion rights More broadly, the poor political environment for Democrats has cleared somewhat, especially as Republicans nominate some candidates who could complicate the GOP\u2019s ability to capitalize on what had been shaping up as a favorable year for them. Even Biden\u2019s fortunes appear to have turned in recent weeks after being beleaguered for much of the last year as crisis after crisis, at home and abroad, crashed into his White House and thwarted ambitious plans. A bumper jobs report on Friday helped tame fears the economy is about to head into recession. And the President presided over the killing of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan, going some way to repair his reputation as a shrewd commander-in-chief, which was tarnished by the chaotic end to the US war in the country. Still, history suggests that the party of first-term presidents \u2013 especially those will an approval rating under 50% \u2013 tend to get a hammering in the midterm elections. And Republicans sense an opening. They are branding the Senate measure as yet another massive spending bill that will worsen already soaring inflation. Economists are divided on Democratic claims that the bill will reduce the cost of living. But if everyday costs continue to rise, it may not matter politically what the truth is \u2013 a damaging impression could take hold that Biden is once again pouring oil on the flames of inflation with a massive spending bill. Joe Biden's hugely consequential Covid isolation Senate Minority Mitch McConnell tried to immediately hammer home his party\u2019s message in the midterms, accusing Democrats of introducing \u201cgiant job-killing tax hikes\u201d and a \u201cwar on American fossil fuel\u201d at a time of high energy prices. \u201c(Democrats\u2019) response to the runaway inflation they\u2019ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,\u201d said the Kentucky Republican. \u201cThe American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border.\u201d Biden was quick to jump on Sunday\u2019s Senate vote as a sign of momentum for his presidency. \u201cSenate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,\u201d the President said, hinting at how Democrats, who have struggled to effectively market his wins as President, will sell the bill to voters. The passage of his health care and climate change bill in the Senate sets Biden up for a domestic legacy that stands comparison with any recent Democratic President. This adds to Biden\u2019s previous successes in Congress, including a bipartisan infrastructure deal that evaded his two most recent predecessors, the first major federal gun safety legislation passed in decades and a pandemic rescue plan early in his presidency that the White House said lifted millions of kids out of poverty. These achievements may not move the political needle for Biden, especially if voters have already made up their mind on his presidency, with polls showing most Americans believe the nation is heading in the wrong direction. The President\u2019s recent successes also appear unlikely to quell a drumbeat of debate about whether he should run for reelection in 2024, when he\u2019ll be in his 80s. The age question is not going away for Biden. But even if the President doesn\u2019t get a substantial short-term boost for his winning streak and see his poll numbers significantly rise, the last few weeks have been vital in shifting narratives about his presidency. Most administrations are ultimately remembered for a handful of achievements that create a kind of narrative shorthand to encapsulate a President\u2019s place in history. If the global climate push succeeds in mitigating the most disastrous impacts on the planet in decades to come, Biden \u2013 who did more than anyone else who held the presidency to respond to the threat \u2013 will come to be remembered for taking action. The same will be the case if a new era of electric vehicles is enshrined by the energy legislation and the US begins to turn its back on the internal combustion engine \u2013 a cornerstone of US freedoms of movement and prosperity for decades. Biden is also likely to get credit from future historians for his role in building on the Obama administration\u2019s advances on expanding access to health care. The Inflation Reduction Act does fall far short of early hopes of transforming home health care, increasing education funding and offering dental and vision plans under Medicare. These are a few reasons why Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, was so critical of a bill he later voted for despite his reservations. \u201cThis reconciliation bill goes nowhere near far enough in addressing the problems facing struggling working families. But it is a step forward and I was happy to support it,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. But political success in the United States, on issues from civil rights to social care, has almost always come in increments, with one presidency building on the gains of another. Given the vicious and widening political divides of modern American, that has been more the case in recent years. So Democrats, who may lose their majorities in November, may at least be able to console themselves by knowing that they did not squander their lease on power as had seemed likely for many months.",

            "article_content": "The Senate on Sunday afternoon passed Democrats\u2019 $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill, in a significant victory for President Joe Biden and his party. The final, party-line vote was 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The package is the product of painstaking negotiations, and its final passage would give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. The Democrat-controlled House, which is expected to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, must approve the bill before Biden can sign it into law. The sweeping bill \u2013 named the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes \u2013 including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks \u2013 and boost the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s ability to collect. It would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit. Senate Democrats, with a narrow 50-seat majority, stayed unified to pass the legislation, using a special, filibuster-proof process to approve the measure without Republican votes. Final passage came after a marathon series of contentious amendment votes known as a \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d that stretched nearly 16 hours from late Saturday night until Sunday afternoon. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin told CNN that the legislation he helped write is \u201ca good balanced bill.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ll all benefit from it; the country will,\u201d Manchin told CNN. \u201cWe have energy security, that\u2019s what we were looking for. And we have the ability to invest in the energy of the future.\u201d Biden praised the Senate for passing the bill in a statement Sunday, thanking Democrats in the chamber and touting the legislation\u2019s climate investments and health care provisions. \u201cToday, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,\u201d Biden said. Senate Democrats have long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus. Manchin played a key role in shaping the legislation \u2013 which only moved forward after the West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal at the end of July, a major breakthrough for Democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out. Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema on Thursday night offered critical support after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals, indicating she would \u201cmove forward\u201d on the sweeping economic package. But Sinema, Manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making crucial alterations on the bill. To avoid a last-minute collapse of the bill on Sunday, Democrats created a plan to win over Sinema, who was concerned over the 15% corporate minimum tax\u2019s impact on subsidiaries owned by private equity. Senate Democrats accepted a narrower tax proposal, but instead of paying for it through a change to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, as Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota suggested, they instead extended the limitation on the amount of losses that businesses can deduct for another two years. The change was intended to prevent House Democrats primarily from coastal districts, who have campaigned on repealing limits on the SALT deduction, from breaking from the bill, when they vote on it later this week. After the bill\u2019s passage in the Senate, Sinema said in a statement it would \u201chelp Arizonans build better lives for themselves and their families by lowering prices, making health care more affordable and accessible, and securing Arizona\u2019s water and energy future,\u201d while also \u201cboosting innovation and spurring job creation.\u201d In a good sign for the bill becoming law, key House Democrats signaled later Sunday that they\u2019ll vote for it despite previous demands over SALT. Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey had been part of the \u201cNo SALT, no deal\u201d caucus. But he said the bill passes his test because it doesn\u2019t raise individual income tax rates. Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, another member of that caucus, echoed his sentiment: \u201cI will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing SALT. Because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district, but in fact significantly lowers their costs, I will be voting for it.\u201d Republicans used the weekend \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes. They were also successful in removing a key insulin provision to cap the price of insulin to $35 per month on the private insurance market, which the Senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the Senate\u2019s reconciliation rules. The $35 insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries remains in place. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the bill included \u201cgiant job-killing tax hikes\u201d and amounted to \u201ca war on American fossil fuel.\u201d The Kentucky Republican said Democrats \u201cdo not care about middle-class families\u2019 priorities.\u201d \u201cAnd their response to the runaway inflation they\u2019ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all,\u201d said McConnell. \u201cThe American people are clear about their priorities. Environmental regulation is a 3% issue. Americans want solutions for inflation, crime, and the border.\u201d While economists disagree over whether the package would, in fact, live up to its name and reduce inflation, particularly in the short term, the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions. The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet. Analysis from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s office \u2013 as well as multiple independent analyses \u2013 suggests the measure would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to President Joe Biden\u2019s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030. The bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Lawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what\u2019s needed to combat the climate crisis. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,\u201d Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. \u201cWe all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.\u201d The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors\u2019 offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. This controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs. Democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way, they wouldn\u2019t expire just after the 2024 presidential election. To boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion. Concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats\u2019 plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear. However, Sinema nixed her party\u2019s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%. The provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers\u2019 profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats. In its place, a 1% excise tax on companies\u2019 stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.

            "article_content": "Jared Kushner details his clashes with Steve Bannon in his new book, describing a \u201ctoxic\u201d West Wing presence who accused him of \u201cundermining the President\u2019s agenda\u201d and threatened to break him \u201cin half\u201d if Kushner turned on him. The detailed account in the memoir \u2013 set to be published next month \u2013 provides fresh insight into the pernicious environment inside former President Donald Trump\u2019s West Wing. Coming just as the former President gears up for a 2024 campaign, excerpts from the book reveal how viciously the Trump team turned on one another from the earliest days of the administration, and how distrust and resentment affected every aspect of governing. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser writes that Bannon once yelled and threatened him in the Cabinet Room after Gary Cohn, a senior economic adviser, informed Kushner that Bannon was leaking negative information about him. \u201cSteve, you gotta stop leaking on Gary,\u201d Kushner said he told Bannon. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a team here.\u201d Kushner writes that Bannon responded: \u201c\u2018Cohn\u2019s the one leaking on me. \u2026 Jared, right now, you\u2019re the one undermining the President\u2019s agenda,\u2019 he continued, his eyes intense and voice escalating into a yell. \u2018And if you go against me, I will break you in half. Don\u2019t f\u2014 with me.\u2019\u201d In \u201cBreaking History: A White House Memoir,\u201d Kushner questions his own response and says he was \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d after Bannon, \u201ca black belt in the dark arts of media manipulation,\u201d declared war on him. CNN has reached out to a spokesman for Bannon on Kushner\u2019s book. Once, Kushner writes, he was urged by Reince Preibus \u2013 Trump\u2019s first chief of staff \u2013 to call a reporter from the New York Times to ward off a story that Priebus and Bannon had been kicked off an Air Force One trip amid Trump\u2019s unhappiness with his senior staff. \u201cWhy are you coming to Florida for the day? I don\u2019t need you there. Stay here,\u201d Kushner says Trump told Priebus and Bannon, before referencing then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 decision to recuse himself from the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThere was no reason for Sessions to recuse himself, and this is going to unleash a disaster,\u201d Trump said, according to Kushner. But after Kushner phoned Maggie Haberman of the New York Times at Priebus\u2019 urging, he says Bannon exploded on him. \u201cHow f\u2014ing dare you leak on me? If you leak out on me, I can leak out on you 28 ways from Sunday,\u201d Bannon said, according to Kushner. Kushner describes how Trump soured on Bannon before eventually firing him in August 2017. Kushner joked to one friend that it was one of his biggest accomplishments, adding that he realized that \u201cjust surviving wasn\u2019t enough\u201d and says he recommitted himself \u201cto finding a way to make my service count.\u201d \u201cAdmitting that I didn\u2019t yet have any major policy successes to show for my seven months in government, I joked, \u2018At least I was able to get Steve Bannon fired. That partially saves the world from immediate disaster,\u2019\u201d Kushner writes, noting that his friend told him, \u201cYou don\u2019t get credit for that\u2026you\u2019re supposed to do that.\u201d West Wing aides mocked Bannon\u2019s responsibilities following his departure. \u201cStephen Miller joked to Hope and me, \u2018I have a plan to split up Steve Bannon\u2019s extensive workload. Hope, you leak to Jonathan Swan at Axios. Jared, you call Mike Bender from the Wall Street Journal. I\u2019ll call Jeremy Peters from the New York Times, and \u2026 we\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d Kushner writes. One of Trump\u2019s final acts in office was pardoning Bannon, who had been charged with defrauding donors of more than a million dollars as part of a fundraising campaign purportedly aimed at supporting Trump\u2019s border wall. Despite their acrimonious past, Kushner says he didn\u2019t oppose the pardon, citing his own father, Charles Kushner, who also received a pardon from Trump. \u201cSeriously?\u201d Trump said to Kushner, according to the book. \u201cYou would really be for that? After everything he did to you?\u201d \u201cBannon single-handedly caused more problems for me than anyone else in my time in Washington. He probably leaked and lied about me more than everyone else combined. He played dirty and dragged me into the mud of the Russia investigation. But now that he was in trouble, I felt like helping him was the right thing to do,\u201d Kushner writes. Last week, Bannon was convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to testify or provide documents for the Jan. 6 committee.",

            "article_content": "Gun owners allowed to carry handguns without permits or training. Parents of transgender children facing investigation by state officials. Women forced to drive hours out-of-state to access abortion. This is Texas now: While the Lone Star State has long been a bastion of Republican politics, new laws and policies have taken Texas further to the right in recent years than it has been in decades. Elected officials and political observers in the state say a major factor in the transformation can be traced back to West Texas. Two billionaire oil and fracking magnates from the region, Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks, have quietly bankrolled some of Texas\u2019 most far-right political candidates \u2013 helping reshape the state\u2019s Republican Party in their worldview. Over the last decade, Dunn and his wife, Terri, have contributed more than $18 million to state candidates and political action committees, while Wilks and his wife, Jo Ann, have given more than $11 million, putting them among the top donors in the state. The beneficiaries of the energy tycoons\u2019 combined spending include the farthest-right members of the legislature and authors of the most high-profile conservative bills passed in recent years, according to a CNN analysis of Texas Ethics Commission data. Dunn and Wilks also hold sway over the state\u2019s legislative agenda through a network of non-profits and advocacy groups that push conservative policy issues. Critics, and even some former associates, say that Dunn and Wilks demand loyalty from the candidates they back, punishing even deeply conservative legislators who cross them by bankrolling primary challengers. Kel Seliger, a longtime Republican state senator from Amarillo who has clashed with the billionaires, said their influence has made Austin feel a little like Moscow. \u201cIt is a Russian-style oligarchy, pure and simple,\u201d Seliger said. \u201cReally, really wealthy people who are willing to spend a lot of money to get policy made the way they want it \u2013 and they get it.\u201d Dunn and Wilks did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In past interviews and opinion pieces, Dunn has argued that his political spending is focused on making Texas\u2019 state government more accountable to its voters, while Wilks has described his donations as aimed at electing principled conservative leaders. Former associates of Dunn and Wilks who spoke to CNN said the billionaires are both especially focused on education issues, and their ultimate goal is to replace public education with private, Christian schooling. Wilks is a pastor at the church his father founded, and Dunn preaches at the church his family attends. In their sermons, they paint a picture of a nation under siege from liberal ideas. \u201cThe cornerstones of our government are crumbling and starting to come apart,\u201d Wilks declared in a 2014 sermon at his insular church, the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day. \u201cAnd it\u2019s because of the lack of morality, the lack of belief in our heavenly Father.\u201d Texas\u2019 far-right shift has national implications: The candidates Dunn and Wilks have supported have turned the state legislature into a laboratory for far-right policy that\u2019s starting to gain traction across the US. Dunn and Wilks have been less successful in the 2022 primary elections than in past years: Almost all of the GOP legislative incumbents opposed by Defend Texas Liberty, a political action committee primarily funded by the duo, won their primaries this spring, and the group spent millions of dollars supporting a far-right opponent to Gov. Greg Abbott who lost by a wide margin. But experts say the billionaires\u2019 recent struggles are in part a symptom of their past success: Many of the candidates they\u2019re challenging from the right, from Abbott down, have embraced more and more conservative positions, on issues from transgender rights to guns to voting. \u201cThey dragged all the moderate candidates to the hard right in order to keep from losing,\u201d said Bud Kennedy, a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspaper who\u2019s covered 18 sessions of the Texas legislature. \u201cI don\u2019t think regular Texans are as conservative as their elected officials,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThe reason that Texas has moved to the right is because the money\u2019s there.\u201d Over the last decade, many of the most conservative bills in the Texas legislature, on topics from LGBT rights to guns to private school vouchers, were killed by the moderate Republicans who held sway in the state House. That changed last year, thanks to people like Valoree Swanson. Swanson was a Sunday school teacher and political activist when she challenged a 14-year incumbent Republican, Debbie Riddle, in 2016 in a district covering Houston\u2019s Republican-dominated northern suburbs. Swanson, who ran to Riddle\u2019s right, shocked political observers by outraising the incumbent \u2013 an unusual feat for a first-time candidate. Her largest donor: Empower Texans, a political action committee created by Dunn and largely funded by him and Wilks. She defeated Riddle in the Republican primary by more than 10 percentage points and went on to easily win the general election. Last year, Swanson won a major legislative victory: She authored the transgender sports bill, which blocks trans students from playing on K-12 school sports teams that aren\u2019t aligned with their genders at birth. While other bills about transgender issues had failed in previous years, the sports bill was approved by a legislature now firmly controlled by the GOP\u2019s right flank after the moderate former House speaker retired. Observers saw it as a validation of the billionaires\u2019 early investments in Swanson\u2019s first campaign, paying off years later. \u201cThey\u2019re effectively investing their money and they\u2019re moving the needle on policy in Austin,\u201d said Scott Braddock, the editor of Quorum Report, a publication that\u2019s been covering the legislature for decades, referring to Dunn and Wilks. \u201cThese are extreme people investing a lot of money in our politics to reshape Texas, such that it matches up with their vision.\u201d Swanson is hardly an outlier: All 18 of the current Republican members of the Texas Senate, and almost half of the Republican members of the Texas House, have taken at least some money from Dunn, Wilks or organizations that they fund. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton have also been major beneficiaries of the billionaires\u2019 spending. Texas is one of just 10 states that allow individuals to make unlimited contributions to state political candidates, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures \u2013 letting Dunn and Wilks have more influence than they might elsewhere in the country. While Dunn and Wilks focus on state politics, they\u2019ve also gotten involved in national races. Wilks, his brother Dan and their wives were among the largest donors to super PACs supporting GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016, contributing a total of $15 million. And Dunn has given millions of dollars to super PACs supporting former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in recent years. In a statement to CNN, Cruz called the Wilks brothers \u201cthe epitome of the American dream\u201d and \u201cfearless champions of conservative causes, much to the consternation of the corrupt corporate media.\u201d Dallas judge removes Texas AG's office as intervenor in case over treatment for transgender youth So far in 2022, Dunn\u2019s and Wilks\u2019 political investments haven\u2019t been as successful as in past years. Defend Texas Liberty, the group they fund, gave more than $3 million to Don Huffines, a former state senator who challenged Abbott in his Republican primary and won just 12% of the vote. Despite his loss, experts pointed out, over the course of the campaign Abbott embraced some of the positions Huffines had staked out, including strong opposition to transgender rights and support for deploying National Guard members to the US-Mexican border. Defend Texas Liberty\u2019s second-largest beneficiary this year has been Shelley Luther, an unsuccessful far-right legislative candidate who attracted national attention after she was arrested for refusing to shut down her Dallas hair salon to comply with coronavirus restrictions. In an interview with CNN, Luther \u2013 who proposed banning Chinese students from Texas universities and declared she is \u201cnot comfortable with the transgenders\u201d \u2013 said that Dunn and Wilks had been integral to her campaign. \u201cWithout them, I couldn\u2019t have even run,\u201d Luther said. But she added that the spending wouldn\u2019t have given the billionaires influence over her votes or decisions: \u201cHe wants me to do what I say that I represent,\u201d she said of Dunn. Dunn and Wilks don\u2019t just use campaign donations to play a role in state politics. They also fund a network of organizations that have been influential at boosting conservative causes. Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, a non-profit chaired by Dunn, has released a \u201cFiscal Responsibility Index\u201d each legislative session grading state lawmakers based on their stances on conservative bills. The scorecard, which is often cited in election ads that show up in voters\u2019 mailboxes, is known in Texas political circles for its ability to make and break Republican primary campaigns. \u201cIf you don\u2019t show up well on the scorecard, you\u2019re going to have a lot of money spent against you,\u201d Seliger said. Texas Republicans say that even a deeply conservative record doesn\u2019t protect someone from a primary challenge funded by Dunn, Wilks and groups they bankroll. State Sen. Bob Deuell had won elections for years in his northeast Texas district and racked up a conservative record \u2013 including co-authoring a 2013 abortion bill that was considered among the strictest in the country at the time, and was struck down by the US Supreme Court. But in 2013, Deuell, a doctor, supported a bill that overhauled Texas\u2019 end-of-life procedures. Texas Right to Life, a group whose largest donor over its history is Wilks, falsely claimed the bill would \u201cstrengthen Texas\u2019 death panels.\u201d The following year, Deuell was challenged by Bob Hall, a tea party activist. Texas Right to Life spent more than $150,000 on mailers, voter guides and political consultants for Hall and other candidates in 2014, airing a barrage of ads claiming Deuell had \u201cturned his back on life and on disabled patients.\u201d Hall won the Republican primary in a runoff by 300 votes. Since that first campaign, Hall has received more than $900,000 from Dunn, Wilks, and groups that they are major funders of \u2013 about a third of his total donations. \u201cAll this West Texas money is what made him into a viable candidate,\u201d Deuell said of Hall, who did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Seliger, Deuell\u2019s former colleague in the Senate, has also staked out conservative positions on many issues, and Dunn gave his campaign $1,000 during his first year in office in 2004. But after Seliger decided he couldn\u2019t support efforts to divert funding from public schools to private school vouchers, Dunn turned on him, he said. In the decade since, he\u2019s found himself repeatedly running against a challenger backed by groups funded by Dunn and Wilks. \u201cThat\u2019s the law of the jungle now in Texas,\u201d Seliger said. \u201cThe majority of Republican Senate members just dance to whatever tune Tim Dunn wants to play.\u201d Dunn has defended his spending and his group\u2019s campaign tactics. \u201cEmpower Texans remains outside the swamp, and the group informs voters who want their representatives to do in Austin what they promised during election season,\u201d he wrote in a 2018 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, responding to criticism of the group\u2019s tactics. \u201cIf all of us outsiders stick together, we can drain the Austin Swamp.\u201d Zachary Maxwell has had an inside view of the billionaires\u2019 influence. He worked for Empower Texans, Dunn\u2019s PAC, and served as campaign manager and chief of staff for then-state Rep. Mike Lang, who received more than 60% of his campaign donations from Wilks and PACs he and Dunn were major funders of. Opinion: How abortion became a war over geography Maxwell told CNN in an interview that there was \u201cno way\u201d Lang could have gotten elected without Wilks\u2019 money. At one campaign fundraiser, he said, Jo Ann Wilks handed Maxwell a check for more than $100,000. \u201cI was like, \u2018Can you even write a check that big?\u2019 \u201d Maxwell remembered. \u201cI about had a heart attack.\u201d Huge sums like that helped buy Wilks influence once Lang took office, Maxwell said. \u201cWhenever (Farris Wilks) called, he answered,\u201d Maxwell said of Lang. \u201cThere was a lot of control.\u201d Lang did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Texas has a long tradition of oil and gas magnates using their fortunes to shape politics. Hugh Roy Cullen, one of Houston\u2019s wealthiest philanthropists, supported the pro-segregation Dixiecrat movement in the 1940s, and H.L. Hunt, who owned a vast swath of the East Texas Oil Field, funded a conservative radio program that aired across the US in the \u201950s and \u201860s. What sets Dunn and Wilks apart, political observers say, is how they\u2019ve spent so much money pushing not just business-friendly policies that boost their bottom line but also socially conservative bills that seem designed to reshape Texas in the image of their far-right Christian values. Both are products of humble West Texas upbringings who earned huge fortunes in Texas\u2019 energy industry. Dunn, 66, lives in Midland, the childhood home of George W. Bush and a center of the state\u2019s oil industry. He grew up in nearby Big Spring, the son of a farm and factory worker, and studied chemical engineering at Texas Tech before working for Exxon and other oil and banking companies. He started his own oil company, now named CrownQuest Operating, in 1996. The firm operates oil wells around West Texas\u2019 Permian Oil Basin and beyond, and pumped 31 million barrels of oil in Texas in 2021, making it the state\u2019s 12th largest oil producer, according to government records. Dunn became more involved in Texas politics in 2006, when he opposed a tax measure that included a new tax on business partnerships \u2013 including some that fund oil wells, Texas Monthly reported. He started an organization to oppose the measure, Empower Texans, which continued to fund conservative causes even after the tax legislation passed. The group\u2019s PAC shut down in 2020, and the billionaires more recently pivoted to funding Defend Texas Liberty. Opinion: Republicans in Texas just voted to reject democracy Wilks, 70, grew up in a converted goat shed in Cisco, Texas, a town of 3,700 where sleepy streets are dotted with more than a dozen churches. He and his younger brother Dan were the sons of a bricklayer and started their careers as apprentice masons. After several other business ventures, in 2002 they founded Frac Tech Services, a company that provided trucking services for fracking operators. It was perfect timing: Fracking was about to take off in Texas and elsewhere in the US amid a boom in shale gas. Less than a decade later, in 2011, the Wilkses sold their majority share of the company for more than $3 billion to a group that included international investors. Since then, they\u2019ve been buying up land in Texas and around the Western US, joining the ranks of America\u2019s largest landowners \u2013 and getting involved in politics. Farris Wilks is the pastor of the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day Church, which operates a sprawling compound outside of Cisco and was founded by his father. In sermons, he has denounced homosexuality and abortion rights in vitriolic terms. \u201cA male on male or a female on female is against nature,\u201d Wilks declared in a 2013 recording of one sermon posted on his church\u2019s website, which is no longer publicly available. \u201cThis lifestyle is the predatorial lifestyle in that they need your children. \u2026 They want your children.\u201d Dunn also preaches at his church, the Midland Bible Church, where he serves as a member of the congregation\u2019s \u201cpulpit team.\u201d \u201cNo matter what rules you grew up with, none of them are enforceable in God\u2019s kingdom,\u201d he declared in one 2018 sermon. In a 2004 interview with The Times of London, Dunn told a reporter he believed that, as the newspaper put it, \u201chis oil has existed for only 4,000 years, the time decreed by Genesis, not 200 million years as his geologists know.\u201d That religious fervor has influenced Dunn\u2019s and Wilks\u2019 political moves. In a meeting with former Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, who is Jewish, Dunn declared that only Christians should hold leadership positions in the chamber, Texas Monthly reported. Straus declined an interview request with CNN. And both Wilks brothers have donated millions of dollars through their personal foundations to conservative Christian groups, including crisis pregnancy centers, according to IRS records, which work to dissuade women from abortion and in some cases share misleading medical information. People who\u2019ve worked with Wilks and Dunn say they share an ultimate goal: replacing much of public education in Texas with private Christian schools. Now, educators and students are feeling the impact of that conservative ideology on the state\u2019s school system. Dorothy Burton, a former GOP activist and religious scholar, joined Farris Wilks on a 2015 Christian speaking tour organized by his brother-in-law and said she spoke at events he attended. She described the fracking magnate as \u201cvery quiet\u201d but approachable: \u201cYou would look at him and you would never think that he was a billionaire,\u201d she said. But Burton said that after a year of hearing Wilks\u2019 ideology on the speaking circuit, she became disillusioned by the single-mindedness of his conservatism. \u201cThe goal is to tear up, tear down public education to nothing and rebuild it,\u201d she said of Wilks. \u201cAnd rebuild it the way God intended education to be.\u201d In sermons, Dunn and Wilks have advocated for religious influence in schooling. \u201cWhen the Bible plainly teaches one thing and our culture teaches another, what do our children need to know what to do?\u201d Wilks asks in one sermon from 2013. Dunn, Wilks and the groups and politicians they both fund have been raising alarms about liberal ideas in the classroom, targeting teachers and school administrators they see as too progressive. The billionaires have especially focused on critical race theory, in what critics see as an attempt to use it as a scapegoat to break voters\u2019 trust in public schooling. In the summer of 2020, James Whitfield, the first Black principal of the mostly White Colleyville Heritage High School in the Dallas suburbs, penned a heartfelt, early-morning email in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder, encouraging his school to \u201cnot grow weary in the battle against systemic racism.\u201d The backlash came months later. Stetson Clark, a former school board candidate whose campaign had been backed by a group that received its largest donations from Dunn and organizations he funded, accused Whitfield during a school board meeting last year of \u201cencouraging all members of our community to become revolutionaries\u201d and \u201cencouraging the destruction and disruption of our district.\u201d The board placed Whitfield on leave, and later voted not to renew his contract. He agreed to resign after coming to a settlement with the district. Clark did not respond to a request for comment. Whitfield said he saw the rhetoric pushed by Dunn and Wilks as a major cause of his being pushed out. \u201cThey want to disrupt and destroy public schools, because they would much rather have schools that are faith-based,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cWe know what has happened over the course of history in our country, and if we can\u2019t teach that, then what do you want me to do?\u201d Meanwhile, the legislature has also been taking on the discussion of race in classrooms, passing a bill last year that bans schools from making teachers \u201cdiscuss a widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.\u201d The legislation was designed to keep critical race theory out of the classroom, according to Abbott, who signed the bill into law. Some of the co-authors and sponsors of the bill and previous versions of the legislation received significant funding from Dunn and Wilks. The billionaires \u201cwant to destroy the public school system as we know it and, in its place, see more home-schooling and more private Christian schools,\u201d said Deuell, the former senator. The Texans feeling the impact include Libby Gonzales, an 11-year-old transgender girl living in the Dallas suburbs. She and her family say they feel like targets after the new law restricting trans students\u2019 participation in school sports went into effect last year \u2013 passed by Swanson and other legislators bankrolled by Dunn and Wilks. Now, Libby won\u2019t be able to play for the girls\u2019 soccer team that she\u2019d like to join. \u201cWe don\u2019t have issues in our neighborhood, among our friends,\u201d said her mother, Rachel Gonzales. \u201cIt\u2019s when our legislators meet and decide that they\u2019re going to leverage their political power against some of the most marginalized kids in our state.\u201d Gonzales has started volunteering for political campaigns in an attempt to turn the tide on anti-trans policies. Libby said she\u2019s been following the news about Texas\u2019 conservative turn \u2013 and worrying what\u2019s coming next. Last month, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a think tank that Dunn serves on the board of, called on the legislature to ban the prescription of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors. \u201cI\u2019m under attack,\u201d Libby said. \u201cI have no idea why people don\u2019t understand that I\u2019m just a girl: an 11-year-old girl living in Texas \u2013 with amazing hair.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump and former vice president Mike Pence held dueling events Friday in Arizona, turning the state\u2019s upcoming Republican primary for governor into a proxy fight between the two former allies as they inch toward what could be a 2024 showdown. The Arizona race is the latest test of Republican voters\u2019 priorities, as they decide between a candidate who has built her campaign around Trump\u2019s election lies and one who more closely reflects Pence\u2019s desire to steer the GOP\u2019s focus away from relitigating 2020 and toward conservative policies. Pence attended two events Friday with Karrin Taylor Robson, the former Arizona Board of Regents member who has become the GOP establishment favorite in the governor\u2019s race and is endorsed by term-limited Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. Pence, Robson and Ducey visited a Peoria business that manufactures tactical equipment for law enforcement on Friday morning, and later planned to attend a border security briefing at the National Border Patrol Council\u2019s office in Tucson. In Peoria, Pence made no mention of Trump\u2019s planned visit to Arizona hours later, or of the revelations of the House committee investigating January 6, 2021 \u2013 when Pence\u2019s refusal to try to thwart voters\u2019 will as Congress counted electoral votes resulted in Trump turning on him. But he did take a thinly veiled swipe at Lake for centering her campaign on Trump\u2019s 2020 resentments, saying that \u201cthere are those who want to make this election about the past.\u201d \u201cWhen you get out and vote for Karrin Taylor Robson, you can send a deafening message that will be heard all across America that the Republican Party is the party of the future,\u201d Pence said. He also criticized Lake\u2019s past support for Democrats, saying, \u201cArizona Republicans don\u2019t need a governor that supported Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, campaigned with a slate of candidates who have parroted his lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election \u2013 led by Kari Lake, a former local television news anchor who Ducey said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d is \u201cmisleading voters with no evidence.\u201d Also part of that Trump ticket are Senate candidate Blake Masters, who is seeking to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in a race that is crucial in the battle for control of the Senate, as well as secretary of state contender Mark Finchem and attorney general hopeful Abe Hamadeh. \u201cPresident Trump taught us how to fight, and I took a few notes,\u201d Lake said at Trump\u2019s rally in Prescott Valley on Friday night. She referred to Trump as \u201cSuperman.\u201d Trump ticked through his usual criticisms of President Joe Biden and revisited the grudges he holds against some Arizona figures who rejected his lies about the 2020 election. He attacked Rusty Bowers, the Arizona state House speaker and a state Senate candidate who detailed to the House January 6 committee Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure him to say the 2020 election was fraudulent. The former President called Bowers \u201ca RINO coward who participated against the Republican Party\u201d in the committee\u2019s hearing, and he endorsed Bowers\u2019 opponent. The question in Arizona\u2019s upcoming primary is whether Trump and his slate of candidates will emerge as a new dominant force in what\u2019s become one of the most important presidential swing states, or whether the state\u2019s GOP establishment can fight back. The stakes are high, with Arizona\u2019s races for statewide office among the most closely watched on the 2022 midterm map. Trump only made a brief mention of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, underscoring the different approaches of the former President and Pence, who has focused  in recent weeks on the next steps that Republicans who oppose abortion should take in statehouses across the country. Ducey said in an interview that Pence \u201cbrings the imprimatur of a true conservative to this race.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s an exceptional leader,\u201d Ducey said. \u201cHe\u2019s been an invaluable partner to me and my team. When he served as governor of Indiana, he was a great colleague and collaborator with other governors. And as Vice President, he continue[d] to be. So when Mike Pence speaks out on this race, it brings all of that and more.\u201d The winner of the Republican primary for governor is likely to face Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is widely seen as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. If Lake wins the August 2 primary, she would join Pennsylvania\u2019s Doug Mastriano on the list of GOP gubernatorial nominees in swing states who have embraced lies and conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Election deniers have won the Republican nod in other key races in battleground states, as well. The Michigan GOP at a convention chose election deniers as their candidates for secretary of state and attorney general, and Nevada Republicans chose an election denier as their secretary of state nominee. If those election deniers win in November\u2019s midterm elections, they would be poised to control their states\u2019 election machinery or influence its legal process in the 2024 presidential race. Arizona is the second gubernatorial primary in which Pence has made a move aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s influence. In Georgia, Pence rallied on the eve of the May primary with Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican who easily defeated the Trump-endorsed former Sen. David Perdue in a contest that revolved around Trump\u2019s pledge to punish Kemp for refuting the former President\u2019s lies about fraud in a state Biden won by 11,779 votes. Biden defeated Trump in Arizona by 10,457 votes, a reality Trump has also rejected. His lies about fraud led Republicans who control the state Senate to commission a partisan review of the 2020 results in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix. That review \u2013 conducted by a firm with no experience auditing elections \u2013 cast doubt on some mail-in ballots, due to what elections experts pointed out were the reviewers\u2019 misunderstandings about how the process works. But it did not find any substantial change in the state\u2019s vote totals. Pence in recent weeks has attempted to steer the Republican Party away from Trump\u2019s obsession with the 2020 election and toward the conservative policies that Pence was known for advocating as a congressman and Indiana governor, before he joined Trump\u2019s ticket in 2016. In a speech Wednesday night at the Florence Baptist Temple in Florence, South Carolina \u2013 one of the first states to vote in the GOP\u2019s presidential nominating process \u2013 Pence focused on the path for abortion opponents after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. He used his remarks to deliver a blueprint of sorts to his fellow Republicans to strengthen abortion restrictions and further limit the federal government\u2019s involvement in the issue. He said Republicans need to back policies that would make adoption easier and less expensive, and urged the party to push for state laws banning abortion. \u201cAs we gather tonight, we must recognize that we\u2019ve only come to the end of the beginning. Standing here in the first days of a post-Roe America, we must resolve that we will not rest, we will not relent until the sanctity of life is restored in the law of every state in the nation,\u201d Pence said. Trump, meanwhile, remains focused on feuds with state officials over the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Following a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that declared mail-in ballot drop boxes illegal in future elections, state Assembly Speaker Robin Vox, a Republican who hired a former state Supreme Court justice who had already embraced Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud to search for evidence to support those claims, said that Trump called him last week to urge him to decertify the state\u2019s 2020 results. \u201cHe would like us to do something different in Wisconsin. I explained it\u2019s not allowed under the constitution. He has a different opinion,\u201d Vos told CNN affiliate WISN. This story has been updated with additional details.

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon is headed to trial on two criminal charges for his failure to comply with the House\u2019s January 6, 2021, investigation 10 months after receiving subpoenas from the select committee. Proceedings began Monday with jury selection at the federal courthouse in Washington, DC. Twenty-two potential jurors have been found, and the 12 that make up the jury and two alternates will be selected Tuesday morning. Opening arguments will begin soon after. The polarizing long-time Trump ally has always been at the top of the January 6 witness list for House investigators. But Justice Department prosecutors say the trial is intended to punish Bannon for noncompliance with the subpoenas, rather than coerce him into sharing information. The case is a major test of what leverage Congress has when a witness evades a House subpoena. Bannon\u2019s is the first of two similar House select committee subpoena cases to head to trial; a contempt case against former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro is still in its early stages. Bannon\u2019s trial also carries special relevance for the House panel as it continues to negotiate bringing in additional witnesses, and as it prepares for a major primetime hearing Thursday night intended to spotlight what committee members have called former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d on January 6. During Monday\u2019s jury selection process, potential jurors were not pressed about their general feelings about Bannon or Trump. They were, however, asked about their news consumption of the House investigation and about this case itself. Some said they\u2019ve consumed a little of the House hearings, if that. Many of the potential jurors said they\u2019ve heard minimally about Bannon\u2019s case, yet a large number of them have taken in at least some of the select committee public hearings. But awareness alone isn\u2019t enough for them to be tossed from the jury pool. Among the jurors who qualified for the 22, there is a man who works with Covid-19 testing, a woman retired from working for a union who\u2019s now writing a dissertation and a self-described \u201crecovering\u201d lawyer who now works at the State Department. The lawyer-turned-government-official told the judge she thought executive privilege might be part of the case, and that the case was about whether Bannon had to testify, or was protected. It\u2019s not clear if Bannon\u2019s legal team will be able to make any arguments that even mention executive privilege to the jury. The judge, US District Judge Carl Nichols, allowed her to continue being a potential juror because her knowledge of the case was limited. Bannon\u2019s team has repeatedly argued that pre-trial publicity, especially with the congressional hearings, should prompt his case at least to be delayed. But many potential jurors said they haven\u2019t formed an opinion or know little of the details and weren\u2019t quizzed extensively about Bannon\u2019s political history. One potential juror said she had a \u201chigh-level awareness\u201d of the select committee proceedings and the case, and heard not everyone had responded to subpoenas they received \u2013 even if they should have. But \u201cthe whole story we haven\u2019t heard yet,\u201d the legal aid worker told the judge. \u201cI\u2019m presuming you\u2019ll have to explain the law to us.\u201d She remained in the jury pool. Another potential juror was tossed from the pool after he told the judge he watched all the select committee hearings, then criticized Republicans who say the election was stolen, and, looking toward Bannon, said, \u201cI do believe he\u2019s guilty.\u201d Prosecutors pledge that their case against Bannon will be presented succinctly, over just a few days, with only two or three prosecution witnesses. That list includes House committee investigators. It\u2019s unknown how extensive Bannon\u2019s defense will be, or if he will want to take the stand in his own defense. He will not be able to force House members to testify, the judge has said. Early in the case, Bannon vowed to make the proceedings the \u201cmisdemeanor from hell for (Attorney General) Merrick Garland, (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and (President) Joe Biden.\u201d But at a recent court hearing, his defense attorney David Schoen complained, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of going to trial here if there is no defense?\u201d Bannon \u2013 who accepted an 11th-hour pardon from Trump in 2021 as he was facing conspiracy wire fraud and money laundering charges in Manhattan\u2019s federal court related to a border wall fundraising scheme \u2013 has made a series of attempts in court in recent days to stop the trial, to fashion more of a defense, or to prepare for possible appeals. The January 6 insurrection: Minute-by-minute So far, Nichols has overwhelmingly sided with the Justice Department on what evidence the jury can hear, cutting off Bannon\u2019s ability to try to defer to advice his attorney gave him or to use internal DOJ policies on presidential advisers that he hoped might protect him. In recent weeks, Trump indicated he wanted to waive any executive privilege that might have applied to Bannon, and Bannon suggested he may be interested in speaking with the House committee \u2013 a series of events that Bannon\u2019s team now wants to try to show to the jury. But his ability to bring up arguments about executive privilege will be, at best, severely limited. Bannon was not a government official during the period the committee is probing. A federal grand jury indicted the right-wing figure in November on two counts of criminal contempt \u2013 one for his failure to provide testimony demanded by the House select committee\u2019s subpoena in the fall and the other for his failure to produce documents. A key issue at trial will be whether the jury agrees with prosecutors and the House that Bannon\u2019s October subpoena deadlines were final, and that he deliberately disregarded them. Both charges he faces are misdemeanors. But if he is found guilty, each carries a mandatory minimum of 30 days in jail. Bannon was one of the first potential January 6 witnesses the House committee subpoenaed \u2013 and he is one of a handful of people the committee has held in contempt. The committee said it wanted to obtain his documents and ask him questions because Bannon had contact with Trump, was in the so-called war room of Trump allies at the Willard hotel in Washington as the riot unfolded, and made a prediction on his podcast before the riot that \u201call hell\u201d was \u201cgoing to break loose.\u201d The January 6 committee is returning to primetime. Here's what you need to know. \u201cIn short, Mr. Bannon appears to have played a multi-faceted role in the events of January 6th, and the American people are entitled to hear his first-hand testimony regarding his actions,\u201d the House committee said in its report putting forward a contempt resolution against Bannon. When Bannon was facing deadlines in October, his attorney Robert Costello told the committee Bannon would not be cooperating with the investigation because of instructions from Trump that said he should, \u201cwhere appropriate, invoke any immunities and privileges he may have.\u201d Since then, criminal investigators have interviewed Costello, as well as a Trump lawyer, Justin Clark, in building their case. According to their description of Clark\u2019s statements, he told Costello Trump couldn\u2019t shield Bannon from total noncompliance with the subpoenas. Ahead of Bannon\u2019s trial, the House committee has featured details about him in some of its public presentations. At a hearing last Tuesday, the committee revealed White House phone logs indicating Bannon and Trump spoke twice on January 5, 2021, including once before Bannon made his predictions about the next day on the podcast. The committee has another hearing planned for primetime Thursday evening. Depending on the pace of the proceedings at DC\u2019s federal courthouse, and the length of his defense presentation and jury deliberations, Bannon\u2019s trial could be over by then.

            "article_content": "Mike Pence seems to have decided that the only way past Donald Trump is through Donald Trump. Unlike many of Trump\u2019s would-be 2024 challengers, his former vice president is issuing a direct challenge by endorsing against him in critical races in states that were hotly contested in 2020. Pence\u2019s latest move is an endorsement of Republican Karrin Taylor Robson in the Arizona governor\u2019s race. \u201cAs Arizona Democrats pursue the reckless Biden-Harris agenda, Karrin Taylor Robson is the only candidate for Governor that will keep Arizona\u2019s border secure and streets safe, empower parents and create great schools, and promote conservative values,\u201d Pence said in a statement announcing the endorsement. (Robson has also been endorsed by outgoing Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who has drawn Trump\u2019s ire for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election results in the state.) That move puts Pence in direct opposition to Trump, who is supporting former local TV anchor Kari Lake in the state\u2019s August 2 primary. \u201cFew can take on the Fake News Media like Kari,\u201d Trump said in announcing his endorsement last fall. Lake has been one of the highest-profile backers of Trump\u2019s false election fraud claims. She has gone as far as to say it is \u201cdisqualifying\u201d that Robson does not believe the election was stolen from Trump. In an interview Sunday with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Ducey, who co-chairs the Republican Governors Association, was blunt in his assessment of Lake: \u201cKari Lake\u2019s misleading voters with no evidence,\u201d he said. The move by Pence to endorse Robson is rightly understood then not as simply a rejection of a Trump-backed pick, but an attempt to affirm that the 2020 election was, in fact, free and fair. Pence and Trump are scheduled to hold dueling rallies on behalf of their preferred candidates in the state on Friday. And this isn\u2019t the first time Pence has done something like this. He backed Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in the spring, putting him, again, on the opposite side of Trump, who had recruited former Sen. David Perdue into the Republican primary. (Kemp, like Ducey, was repeatedly attacked by Trump for his refusal to overturn the 2020 results in his state.) Campaigning with Kemp the day before the May 24 primary, Pence was clear about what he believed the vote meant. \u201cWhen you say yes to Gov. Brian Kemp tomorrow, you will send a deafening message all across America that the Republican Party is the party of the future,\u201d Pence said. Kemp crushed Perdue by more than 50 points. It\u2019s a remarkable turn of events that Pence, more so than any other Republican considering the 2024 race, has emerged as the one willing to stand up to Trump and his election lies. (Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, isn\u2019t getting involved in contested primaries outside of his state.) After all, Pence spent four years as essentially Trump\u2019s wingman. At seemingly every bill signing, Pence was standing behind Trump, giving him an \u201cattaboy, boss.\u201d At speech after speech in the White House, Pence was in the background, nodding along to the points Trump made. At one Cabinet meeting in 2017, Pence praised Trump every 12 seconds \u2013 for three minutes straight. So, what happened? Well, January 6 happened. Trump engaged in an extended pressure campaign to try to get Pence to overturn the 2020 election results. And as Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified before the House select committee investigating January 6, Trump was apparently approving of the chants of \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d from the rioters storming the US Capitol that day. That, you would think, changes someone. Pence now seems to understand that the only way he has a political future in the GOP is to prove \u2013 through a series of steps \u2013 that Trump is less powerful than he is being made out to be. The Kemp endorsement \u2013 and the governor\u2019s primary victory \u2013 put a crack in the Trump wall. Pence hopes Arizona will make that crack even bigger.",

            "article_content": "At 79, Joe Biden is the oldest president in American history. Eighteen months into his term, the burdens of governing have staggered him. And to hear recent political chatter, you might consider those two facts directly related. Adversaries cast Biden as too feeble for the demands of the Oval Office; allies have begun nudging him toward retirement. Yet that represents Republican opportunism and Democratic nervousness before November\u2019s elections rather than any plausible assessment of cause and effect. Without doubt, Biden\u2019s age complicates his hopes of winning another term. It has nothing to do with his problems in this one. Consider the problems, which began to mushroom a year ago when most Americans still approved his job performance. The first hammer blow resulted from Biden\u2019s determination to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan, a popular goal he shared with his two immediate predecessors. It wasn\u2019t his age that caused the lightning collapse of the Afghan government and the damaging images of chaos that unfolded on live television thereafter. Afghanistan showed Biden unbowed Around the same time, the Delta variant triggered a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Biden\u2019s age didn\u2019t make the once-in-a-century pandemic unpredictable, or so many Republicans hostile to life-saving vaccines that could hasten its end. More bad news arrived at year\u2019s end. After lengthy, torturous negotiations, the centerpiece of the President\u2019s economic agenda collapsed on Capitol Hill. Ever since Biden launched his third White House candidacy, progressive Democrats had fretted about the septuagenarian\u2019s outlook as well as physical stamina. Specifically, they feared he held outdated views about the value of negotiating with congressional Republicans. In reality, Biden has achieved a few bipartisan victories, from infrastructure spending in 2021 to gun safety legislation this year. He faltered on the objective he shares with progressives and nearly all other Democrats: major investments to ameliorate climate change and lift struggling families, financed by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The reason for that failure is simple. In an evenly divided Senate, Democrats can\u2019t afford to lose a single vote on party priorities. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who represents a coal state that opposed Biden by a landslide margin, held out. In recent months, surging inflation has kept Biden gasping for political air. But price growth didn\u2019t reach an annualized 9.1% in last week\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics report because the President soon will enter his ninth decade. Inflation has surged, here and around the world, from the toxic combination of pandemic disruptions and overheated consumer demand. Evidence indicates Biden contributed to the problem through his oversized $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Why Washington can't have an honest debate about inflation But neither that original error, nor later errant assessments that inflation would be \u201ctransitory,\u201d were unique to the aged chief executive. Like Biden with his fiscal largesse, the (10 years younger) Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell until recently had maintained expansive monetary policies in hopes of averting a tepid post-pandemic recovery. Like most economic forecasters, they didn\u2019t expect inflation to last long. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 which continued the pattern of cross-border aggression Vladimir Putin established in 2008 \u2013 has made things worse by further running up food and energy costs. For younger Americans, the most bitter recent source of disappointment came from the US Supreme Court. Democratic voters and politicians soon faulted Biden for a lack of \u201curgency\u201d and \u201cfight\u201d after the court\u2019s conservative majority erased the federal constitutional right to abortion. But that\u2019s just frustration talking. Presidents can no more will away Supreme Court decisions than they can arm wrestle gas prices down. Nor can Biden \u201cabolish\u201d the Senate filibuster to overcome roadblock Republican opposition on abortion or voting rights without more Democratic senators willing to go along. From the nature of the Senate to the Electoral College, Democrats have collided with structural impediments to majority rule much older than the occupant of the White House. For years, fear of Democratic majorities has fueled the Republican Party\u2019s turn toward extremism. It produced a violent insurrection against the post-election transfer of power before Biden ever took the oath of office. Dismissed in 2012, this diagnosis of GOP ills has now become undeniable As it happens, that Republican extremism may end up helping Biden\u2019s party stave off political disaster this fall. If it doesn\u2019t, that would only extend a century-old pattern that lately has punished Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton (at age 48) and Barack Obama (at age 49) in their first midterm contests. Biden\u2019s age clouds his 2024 reelection prospects in any event. He looks the part of the oldest president, walking more stiffly and talking more haltingly than just a few years ago. And voters have good reason to care. With every passing year, even healthy 80-somethings face elevated risks of medical setbacks and mental decline. But a cursory glance at political conditions in other countries makes plain that, at least for now, Biden\u2019s physical condition does not explain his political condition. French President Emmanuel Macron (44) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (50) rank among the fittest, most vibrant heads of state in the world. Recent measures of their popularity match Biden\u2019s standing in the most recent CNN average of major national polls: 39% approve, 58% disapprove.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Senate candidates in key battleground states continue to rake in massive amounts of campaign money as the battle for control of the chamber intensifies, according to new campaign finance reports. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 New filings with the Federal Election Commission also show former President Donald Trump\u2019s political operation continuing to pull in millions of dollars from his army of supporters \u2013 but at a slower pace \u2013 as he plots a potential third bid for the White House. And reports at the state level show energized donors driving big sums to high-profile gubernatorial races. Here\u2019s a look at key takeaways from new campaign reports: In race after race, Democratic Senate contenders are outraising their Republican rivals as they prepare for a difficult fall election season \u2013 marked by soaring inflation and public dissatisfaction with President Joe Biden\u2019s performance. In Pennsylvania \u2013 where the race for an open Republican seat could determine which party controls the Senate \u2013 Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democratic nominee, raised nearly $11 million during the second quarter, which covered the three months ended June 30 \u2013 swamping his Republican rival, celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz. Oz reported receipts of nearly $5.5 million in the quarter, but that included a total of $3.2 million that he loaned to his campaign before and after the hard-fought May 17 Republican primary he won after a recount. And Fetterman had nearly $5.5 million remaining in the bank at June 30 to Oz\u2019s $1.1 million, filings late Friday with the FEC show. (Oz\u2019s ability to tap his personal wealth in the months ahead could chip away at Fetterman\u2019s current cash-on-hand advantage, however.) Even so, Fetterman \u2013 largely sidelined from the campaign trail as he recovers from a May stroke \u2013 has used his funds to advertise heavily on television and underwrite unorthodox efforts to target his opponent. In Nevada, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada had a second-quarter haul of $7.5 million compared with Republican challenger Adam Laxalt\u2019s nearly $2.9 million. In Colorado, two-term Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet started July with a stockpile of more than $8 million \u2013 roughly 10 times the cash reserves of businessman Joe O\u2019Dea, who emerged victorious from the Republican primary in late June. Republicans worry about Georgia Senate race with Herschel Walker's liabilities on display And two of the most endangered Democratic senators on the ballot this year \u2013 Georgia\u2019s Raphael Warnock and Arizona\u2019s Mark Kelly \u2013 each accelerated already blistering fundraising paces, bringing in $17.2 million and nearly $13.6 million, respectively, in the second quarter. Warnock started July with more than $22.2 million in cash reserves, more than three times the amount banked by his Republican rival, former NFL star Herschel Walker, the filings show. In Arizona, meanwhile, Kelly was sitting atop a cash haul of nearly $25 million on June 30, as Republicans vying to take him on in November head to an August 2 primary in the Grand Canyon State. Even in states viewed as less competitive this fall, Democrat Senate candidates emerged from the second quarter with the financial edge. In red-leaning Ohio, for example, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan raised $9.1 million through the end of June for his Senate bid \u2013 more than double the amount he collected in the first three months of the year. He had $3.6 million in remaining cash at the end of June. J.D. Vance \u2013 who won the Buckeye State\u2019s bruising GOP Senate primary in May, aided by super PAC spending and a Trump endorsement \u2013 raised a fraction of that amount in the April-to-June window: About $1 million. And the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author ended the quarter with about $629,000 remaining in the bank and even more \u2013 nearly $883,000 \u2013 in debts. \u201cDemocratic Senate candidates across the battlegrounds are smashing fundraising records \u2013 and they\u2019re powered by energized, grassroots supporters who are committed to protecting and expanding our Senate Majority that is fighting to address working families\u2019 most pressing priorities,\u201d Eli Cousin, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement. Democrats get bounce in polls after Roe v. Wade is overturned Also helping to drive the surge in donations, operatives say: Voter alarm over the US Supreme Court ruling last month that found there was no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion. A draft version of the opinion had been leaked in early May. The day the actual ruling was released \u2013 June 24 \u2013 and the following day marked the top two strongest fundraising days of the election cycle for the DSCC, officials with the Democrats\u2019 Senate campaign arm have said. For their part, Republicans say the fall election still will turn on pocketbook issues, such as rising inflation. \u201cEven if Democrats have all the money in the world, they are on the wrong side of the issues,\u201d said Jack Pandol, a spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cYou see voters who are frustrated with high inflation, with crime and with an uncontrolled border,\u201d he added. \u201cAll the money in the world is not going to change that dynamic.\u201d And outside Republican groups \u2013 such as the SLF and its nonprofit arm One Nation \u2013 will spend heavily to drive that message to voters. SLF ended June with more than $104 million in cash reserves \u2013 a record for the group. The flood of money into key races has allowed campaigns to get on the air early and often. Already, five top US Senate races \u2013 in Ohio, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin \u2013 have seen more than $350 million of advertising through mid-July, according to AdImpact data. And hundreds of millions more in ad spending has been booked for the critical fall months. This may be Democrats' only chance to blunt a red wave in November Buoyed by his strong fundraising, Warnock has been especially active, spending more than $27 million on advertising this year, with a sustained ad campaign targeting GOP opponent Walker\u2019s fitness for office, and a mix of spots touting the incumbent\u2019s work in Congress and his biography. Republican groups such as One Nation have fired back with attack ads of their own, hammering Democrats on inflation and gas prices. One Nation has spent more than $34 million on spots targeting vulnerable Democratic incumbents such as Warnock and Kelly, along with Sen. Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire. The group has also been active in Wisconsin supporting GOP Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s reelection bid. Even as the political world focuses on the midterms, Trump is weighing his own comeback campaign for the White House. Friday\u2019s filing shows he raised $17 million through a joint fundraising committee in the April-to-June period. That\u2019s a dip from the $19 million that the committee collected during the first three months of the year. This comes as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential rival to become the GOP\u2019s standard-bearer in 2024, builds an enormous war chest for his reelection this fall. As of July 1, CNN has reported, DeSantis\u2019 political committee and campaign reported a combined $118 million in cash reserves. And that total doesn\u2019t count more recent infusions, such as a $10 million check last week from a wealthy space entrepreneur. Ron DeSantis has raised more than $100 million for his reelection bid. Could he use that money in a presidential race? The governor\u2019s political team already has identified ways to turn some of his massive war chest into money that could be spent in a federal campaign, should he decide to run for the presidency, a source with knowledge of those conversations told CNN. In a statement Friday night, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich sought to push back on the notion of weakening financial support for the former President. He said Trump \u201cis continuing the build the most unprecedented political effort in the history of American politics.\u201d \u201cHe is not only raising money at an unparalleled pace,\u201d Budowich added, \u201cbut he is investing in America First candidates and continuing to grow the MAGA movement into 2022 and beyond.\u201d Trump\u2019s Save America Joint Fundraising Committee directs money to other parts of Trump\u2019s operation, including the leadership PAC \u2013 dubbed Save America \u2013 that is the former President\u2019s main political vehicle. Save America PAC had $101 million remaining in its coffers at the end of May, according to its most recent public filing. It will report its June fundraising and spending later this month. New state reports also point to gubernatorial races awash in campaign money. In traditionally red Texas, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign announced Friday that it had brought in $27.6 million in the late February-to-June period \u2013 a record-breaking sum for a state office. Beto O'Rourke confronts Texas governor during update on Uvalde elementary school shooting The haul put the former congressman and onetime presidential candidate ahead of Republican incumbent, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who reported raising $24.9 million during the same period. O\u2019Rourke has touted receiving more than 500,000 online contributions as he has made the state\u2019s gun laws a key focus following the mass shooting in May at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. But Abbott, who is seeking a third term, is expected to have a much larger pool of available cash to spend. And in one of the marquee gubernatorial contests of the midterms, Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee in Georgia, has jumped to a substantial fundraising lead over the incumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp. CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans are plotting revenge on the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, as the GOP weighs a broader effort to re-litigate some of Donald Trump\u2019s biggest election grievances if it recaptures the House majority. The former President has been itching for payback and leaning heavily on his Capitol Hill allies to defend him against a recent slew of damaging revelations about his role in the deadly attack on the US Capitol. Now, as Republicans search for ways to undermine those findings, their party has started to lay the groundwork to investigate the select committee itself. Republicans have already asked the January 6 panel to preserve a broad range of documents in its possession \u2013 a signal they\u2019re preparing to force those records to be turned over should they wield powerful committee gavels next year. And privately, Republican sources say there have been discussions about subpoenaing members of the select committee, particularly Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who is fighting an uphill battle for reelection, and retiring Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, if both Republicans are private citizens next year. It\u2019s an idea that has garnered support among allies of the former President. But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2013 who has refused to comply with a subpoena from the select committee and has long held that the panel lacks the authority to haul in private citizens \u2013 is cool to the idea, according to a Republican source familiar with his thinking. Other investigative ideas under consideration among House Republicans include establishing their own select committee \u2013 or repurposing the current one \u2013 to investigate matters such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s role in Capitol security enforcement on January 6, 2021; the intelligence and security failures surrounding that day; and the treatment of the rioters who have been jailed for their role in the insurrection. Meanwhile, some of Trump\u2019s fiercest acolytes have started to publicly push for hearings and probes into his baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election \u2013 even as the select committee reveals an avalanche of testimony about how those lies incited a violent mob to attack the Capitol. \u201cI think that it is important to seek the truth \u2013 wherever it may lead \u2013 on all of this,\u201d GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, told CNN. \u201cWe should be looking at whatever we can through the standing committees and have a robust debate about it.\u201d The GOP\u2019s growing desire to craft a counternarrative on January 6 \u2013 and shift the blame away from Trump \u2013 comes as the former President is gearing up to soon announce another White House bid. Pursuing that effort could also be politically advantageous for McCarthy, whose expected bid for speaker would be made easier with support from Trump. The former President has sometimes criticized the California Republican over how he has handled the GOP\u2019s defense of Trump during the select committee\u2019s investigation. While McCarthy has vowed to conduct aggressive oversight and investigations, it\u2019s unclear just how far he is willing to go when it comes to January 6 and the 2020 presidential election. And there could be some risks for turning the House into a venue for Trump\u2019s vengeance campaign: Some Republicans have warned against rehashing old issues, arguing that the party would be better served by moving past 2020. \u201cI get it. There are people that still want to kick that dead horse,\u201d said Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, who quit the powerful GOP Steering Committee because he was outraged some of his colleagues weren\u2019t reprimanded for their conduct on January 6. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I think the smartest political move for us is to concentrate our efforts on the policies that will absolutely make life better for all Americans.\u201d Kinzinger, meanwhile, said he wasn\u2019t sweating the GOP subpoena threats and accused Republican leaders of being willing to destroy the Constitution to do Trump\u2019s bidding. \u201cIt just shows (McCarthy) is trying to impress the Freedom Caucus,\u201d Kinzinger told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s who he is.\u201d McCarthy began working to craft an oversight agenda earlier this year in anticipation of a House Republican majority. He has gathered input from key stakeholders, influential conservatives and \u2014 of course \u2013 Trump. The GOP leader and relevant committee heads have been actively pursuing document requests and preservation notices, and McCarthy will continue to seek input from across the House GOP Conference about which probes to pursue next year, according to the Republican source familiar with his thinking. Aside from possible election-related inquiries, some of the GOP\u2019s potential investigative targets include the origins of the novel coronavirus, particularly the laboratory leak theory that has gained steam in Republican circles; the bureaucratic decision-making behind Covid-related school closures and vaccine mandates; any business dealings involving President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter; the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan; and the border policies being overseen by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. But there\u2019s also been growing calls on the right for the GOP to use its firepower to rewrite the narrative on January 6. Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a Trump ally and major proponent of overturning the 2020 election who was subpoenaed by the select committee, sent a letter to the House Oversight Committee this week demanding hearings into the election conspiracy theories featured in the widely debunked movie \u201c2000 Mules.\u201d \u201cPennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Texas, all have issues. \u2026 They fall into categories that we call irregularities, abnormalities and inconsistencies,\u201d said Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, who signed the letter long with 10 other House Republicans. \u201cWe believe we\u2019re due answers.\u201d But not everyone in the GOP believes they should use their power and platform to revisit the 2020 election. \u201cWe need to move on. I don\u2019t support retribution politics,\u201d one senior Republican told CNN. \u201cThis is not what the majority of Americans care about.\u201d There seems to be more of an appetite in the GOP for focusing on the security failures that enabled the Capitol to be breached on January 6. Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois and Jim Banks of Indiana have been leading a GOP investigation into the matter and are planning to unveil their findings in a report sometime this fall, according to sources familiar with the matter. That timeline that would coincide with \u2013 and, the GOP hopes, help counter-program \u2014 the select committee\u2019s final report about the insurrection. But Davis, who was poised to chair the House Administration Committee in a GOP-led chamber, recently lost his primary to a colleague backed by Trump. Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, who is next in line to lead the Administration Committee, told CNN he is \u201cdefinitely interested\u201d in chairing the panel next year, though the decision is ultimately up to McCarthy. Loudermilk feels strongly that the committee, which has jurisdiction over Capitol security and election issues, should pick up the reins of Davis\u2019 probe if Republicans control committee gavels next year. \u201cRodney\u2019s doing yeoman\u2019s work. But there\u2019s a lot of info we aren\u2019t privy to or able to get our hands on,\u201d Loudermilk told CNN, citing his party\u2019s lack of subpoena power in the minority. Loudermilk has his own grievances about the select committee, which publicly raised concerns about a tour he gave in the Capitol complex the day before the January 6 insurrection. On the GOP\u2019s requests for the select committee to preserve documents, Loudermilk said: \u201cIf they have not preserved or turned those over \u2013 especially those that are departing \u2013 then we would definitely have to look at (subpoenas).\u201d There\u2019s also a debate inside the conference about whether to create a select committee to investigate these issues. But lawmakers familiar with McCarthy\u2019s thinking believe his preference is to see any investigations housed within the committees that have relevant jurisdiction, although he may need to offer concessions to his right flank to secure the speaker\u2019s gavel. \u201cThat\u2019s a conference decision, it\u2019ll be a Speaker Kevin McCarthy decision,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who is in line to chair the powerful House Judiciary Committee if the GOP wins the majority. When asked whether Trump was itching for investigations, he added: \u201cHe wants the truth out there for the American people, just like we all do.\u201d McCarthy was noncommittal when asked by CNN whether he wants to pursue investigations into January 6 security failures, potentially in the form of a select committee, if Republicans are in charge next year. \u201cLet\u2019s wait. Don\u2019t prejudge our report,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what our report is. \u2026 Then we\u2019ll evaluate.\u201d But it\u2019s not just 2020 that Trump\u2019s allies are interested in revisiting. There\u2019s also been talks of scrutinizing the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, GOP sources said. Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee quietly met with former Trump national security official Kash Patel in a secured classified setting on Wednesday, raising eyebrows in the Capitol as GOP lawmakers weigh potential investigative targets for next year. Patel, who remains close with Trump and speaks to the former President regularly, was an aide to former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, a onetime Republican congressman from California, and played a prominent role in pushing back against the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia. Patel was \u201cwaived in\u201d by GOP members of the Intelligence Committee, according to a source familiar with the matter, who said it was \u201cvery odd\u201d for the minority party to hold such a meeting. Democrats on the committee were not notified that the meeting was taking place, according to the source, raising questions about its purpose. If elected speaker, McCarthy will have to balance the investigative demands of his right flank with the preferences of his so-called governing wing. While McCarthy and Trump speak \u201cweekly,\u201d according to people familiar with their relationship, several Trump allies said the former President hasn\u2019t felt the need to pressure the California Republican to consider wielding his potential investigative powers aggressively because McCarthy has already shown he wants to do so. \u201cThere is crossover with what Trump wants because, in general, he wants Kevin to be tougher, but a lot of this is being driven by McCarthy on his own,\u201d said a person familiar with the former President\u2019s thinking. Still, McCarthy continues to hold some cards close to his chest \u2013 not wanting to telegraph his moves and tip off potential witnesses. While that thirst for vengeance may dictate some of Republicans\u2019 targets of inquiries, people close to McCarthy said it would not affect the investigative process or the conduct of committee members and their staff. The House minority leader has also rejected some oversight targets floated to him by conservatives that he doesn\u2019t believe have merit and would thus be a waste of time and taxpayer resources. \u200b Inside Trump\u2019s orbit, allies told CNN that McCarthy\u2019s attitude toward aggressive oversight investigations changed earlier this year after Pelosi rejected his bid to install two staunch Trump allies \u2013 Banks and Jordan \u2013 on the House panel investigating the former President\u2019s involvement in January 6. McCarthy was also enraged when the panel slapped him and several other GOP lawmakers with subpoenas. \u201cPelosi rejecting Jordan and Banks [from the House Select Committee investigating January 6] was a turning point for Kevin,\u201d said a person familiar with his thinking. \u201cHe was like, \u2018OK, if that\u2019s how you want to play.\u2019 I think you\u2019re going to see him play a lot harder ball when he takes the majority than people realize,\u201d this person continued.",

            "article_content": "Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has endorsed Republican candidate Karrin Taylor Robson in the race to succeed him as the top executive in the critical battleground state, putting him at odds with former President Donald Trump, who is backing former television anchor Kari Lake in the GOP gubernatorial primary. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at each of the candidates for Governor this year, and there\u2019s no question who is the proven conservative ready to lead on Day One: Karrin Taylor Robson,\u201d Ducey, who is term-limited, said in a statement released Thursday by the Taylor Robson campaign. Ducey\u2019s move to back Taylor Robson comes as early voting began this week ahead of the state\u2019s August 2 primary. It also thrusts the governor back into a political showdown with Trump in a now two-year clash over election lies about the Arizona election system. Trump has endorsed Lake, a firebrand first-time candidate and former Phoenix television anchor, who is a leading promoter of lies about the 2020 election results. By choosing to back Taylor Robson, Ducey is throwing his considerable Arizona political force behind the strongest challenger to Lake. Lie as litmus test: Arizona governor candidate Kari Lake calls it 'disqualifying' for rival not to declare 2020 election 'stolen' \u201cGovernor Ducey has been a strong conservative leader who has trimmed government, gotten our fiscal house in order and turned Arizona into a beacon of economic opportunity,\u201d Taylor Robson said in the news release. \u201cAs Governor, I intend to build on that legacy.\u201d Trump mounted a public and sustained attack against Ducey shortly after the November 2020 election, which saw Trump lose Arizona to Joe Biden. Ducey defended his state\u2019s election process, tweeting, \u201cThat\u2019s the law. I\u2019ve sworn an oath to uphold it, and I take my responsibility seriously.\u201d Trump responded by raising baseless voter fraud allegations and then blasting out statement after statement in a sustained, monthslong attack on Ducey for following state laws. Ducey, courted by national Republicans to run for the US Senate as a challenger to Democratic incumbent Mark Kelly, decided to not run. Despite Trump\u2019s ire, Ducey has remained a popular figure in Arizona among moderates and establishment Republicans, even as the former President maintains a strong hold on the Arizona GOP base. Ducey has sparred with Lake publicly during the primary. After Lake criticized the governor for not being strong enough on the US-Mexico border, Ducey struck back, telling The Arizona Republic that the candidate was \u201cmaking things up.\u201d Ducey has yearslong ties to Taylor Robson, having appointed her to the Arizona Board of Regents in 2017. Last week, Taylor Robson earned the endorsement of former US Rep. Matt Salmon, a day after he ended his bid for the GOP gubernatorial nomination.",

            "article_content": "Before the congressional hearings this month, Franzetta Ivy offered private prayers for the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, hopeful that all Americans would watch the historic proceedings with open minds. \u201cI prayed for the best outcome \u2013 that God\u2019s will, not my will or anybody else\u2019s will, be done,\u201d said Ivy, a pastor and a Democratic voter in the suburbs of Atlanta. \u201cI prayed that they would tune in and watch, so they can see for themselves. You don\u2019t just go by what somebody says, you should investigate and search it out to see for yourself.\u201d While millions have watched this month as the first four televised hearings have shed an unsparing light on former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, it\u2019s far from certain whether Ivy\u2019s prayers have been answered. Conversations with Democrats in Atlanta and Republicans in the surrounding suburbs this week provide a reality check for the high bar facing the House committee in breaking through at a moment of extreme polarization. Frustrated with January 6 hearings, Trump turns ire toward his allies Many Americans seem to have simply tuned out, with Republicans citing their disdain for the mostly Democratic makeup of the committee, lack of interest in yet another divisive act from Washington or the simple fact of being busy with summer and exhausted with politics. \u201cI really think they are just after Trump,\u201d said Bill Kumle, a Republican retiree out for an afternoon walk here earlier this week. \u201cThey\u2019re not after the truth.\u201d A half-century after Watergate captivated the country and ultimately led to President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation, the remarkable revelations of the House select committee are competing with other distractions in a deeply divided nation. A new Quinnipiac University Poll found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans are following news about the work of the committee at least somewhat closely, although only about one-quarter say they are following it very closely. So far, the poll found, the hearings do not seem to be changing minds about whether Trump committed a crime, with 46% of adults saying he did and 47% saying he did not. Early measures of the hearings\u2019 impact and comparisons to Watergate may be fraught, given the vast differences in how Americans consume news and information today, with much of the January 6 committee testimony designed to be shared on social media. More than 20 million TV viewers watched the first prime-time hearing on June 9, according to estimates, while television viewership fell to about half that for the subsequent daytime hearings. The findings \u2013 so far, at least \u2013 are largely seen through a familiar partisan lens that has dominated the Trump era. \u201cThe committee overall is swayed more on the liberal side than the conservative side and it\u2019s not something that interests me,\u201d said George Nozick, who has been picking up bits and pieces of the hearing through news accounts. \u201cWith inflation, gas, the border and everything else, I choose to take it easy.\u201d January 6 committee planning to delay hearing schedule into July after Thursday's meeting Nozick is among the Republicans in Georgia who have never believed Trump\u2019s false claims that he won the state, which is again emerging as a crucial battleground in November\u2019s midterm elections. And Nozick believes the former President crossed a line when he called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger looking \u201cto find 11,780 votes\u201d to usurp the will of the voters. Republican voters in the Peach State rebuked Trump\u2019s efforts to oust Raffensperger \u2013 along with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who also had rebuffed Trump\u2019s entreaties to overturn the 2020 election \u2013 in primaries earlier this year. \u201cOur ex-President is just focused on his own wants and needs,\u201d Nozick said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s not good. You\u2019ve got to move on and accept what is and go on from there.\u201d Even so, Nozick said he did not see the value in the committee\u2019s investigation. He said he would read its final conclusions but that he\u2019d prefer for the country and his party to move on. Interviews with people from both parties found widespread support for former Vice President Mike Pence and admiration for his conduct overseeing the certification of the Electoral College vote for Joe Biden as the Capitol was under siege. \u201cI\u2019m not a big Mike Pence fan, but I really respect what Mike Pence did,\u201d said Frank Richards, a retired Democrat who was eating lunch as the hearings played on television at Manuel\u2019s, an Atlanta tavern. \u201cI really think he was extremely brave to go back into the Capitol with folks who wanted to lynch him and carry through with his responsibilities.\u201d Ruth Atkinson, a Republican who believes the hearings are a waste of her time and the government\u2019s money, echoed that praise for the former vice president. \u201cI think Pence had to do what he did,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cI think he saw what was going on and I think he spoke the truth.\u201d Despite new details of the lengths Trump and his allies went to try to overturn the election results, even after Attorney General William Barr and others inside the White House and the campaign advised against those schemes, Atkinson and many other Republicans blasted the committee as partisan. Amid high-profile hearings, some January 6 committee members beef up security \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Liz Cheney. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s doing this,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cShe\u2019s gone over to the Democratic side.\u201d The criticism of Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who is vice chair of the committee, echoed across virtually every interview with a GOP voter. Cheney, along with GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, has been relentlessly targeted by Trump and his loyalists. Richard Bianco, a Republican here who said he had voted for Trump in 2016 but not in his bid for reelection, said he wished the Justice Department were conducting the hearings and investigating, rather than Congress. The department is conducting its own investigation, but not through public hearings. \u201cBy going through Congress, nothing is going to get done quickly,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican and a lot of people need to be held accountable, but we\u2019re not getting anywhere.\u201d Harvey and Patricia Newman of Atlanta said they have watched nearly every moment of the hearings in Washington, even recording the sessions if they are not at home. \u201cI would like to hope that people of all political persuasions understand the threat that this represents and what we need to do as a nation to prevent this from ever happening again,\u201d said Harvey Newman, a retired college professor, who praised the committee\u2019s thoroughness. \u201cThis is an attack on our democracy,\u201d said Patricia Newman, a retired financial adviser, chatting as she finished lunch before the hearing began on Tuesday. \u201cI do not think the Watergate hearings rose to that level or even close.\u201d The Newmans, both Democrats, said finding the truth for history is important, but even more so for protecting the integrity of future elections. \u201cI hope it\u2019s more than just for history,\u201d said Patricia Newman, who believes the hearings should result in criminal charges for some top officials. \u201cIf they get off, I can\u2019t tell you how worried I am about 2024.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, the lone remaining anti-abortion Democrat in the House, will defeat progressive Jessica Cisneros in a runoff, CNN projects. The Texas Democratic Party announced the results of a recount in the race on Tuesday, which found Cuellar ahead by 289 votes. Cisneros, who also lost to Cuellar in 2020, conceded on Tuesday, according to a release from her campaign. \u201cWe always knew this was an uphill battle. We were up against a corrupt political machine, Republican-funded Super PACs, the Koch brothers, private prisons, Big Oil, the Chamber of Commerce, dark money groups, Big Pharma, and nearly the entire Democratic Party establishment in Washington - and we still refused to back down,\u201d Cisneros said in a statement. \u201cWith this close of a margin, it\u2019s clear that without their aggressive interference in the lives of South Texas families, we would have won.\u201d The result is a blow to progressives and, more broadly, Democrats who support abortion rights and hope that anger over the Supreme Court\u2019s draft opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade might drive the issue to the forefront this election cycle. It also marks what many might have considered an unlikely revival for Cuellar, whose political fate was thrown into doubt earlier this year before the primaries when the FBI searched his home and a campaign office. In April, Cuellar\u2019s lawyer said federal authorities told him that his client was not a target of the investigation. Despite being hammered over his anti-abortion position by Cisneros and her allies, including EMILY\u2019s List, which invested big late in the race, Cuellar again emerged with the nomination in the South Texas district, which runs south from San Antonio to the US-Mexico border. Cuellar, like other Democratic moderates during this year\u2019s primaries, benefited from a surge of outside money and the backing of party leaders in Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip James Clyburn, who traveled to Texas to campaign for Cuellar, all stood with the congressman despite frustration from pro-abortion rights voters. \u201cDemocratic leadership trampled over their own stated principles to carry Henry Cuellar to victory,\u201d Natalia Salgado, the progressive Working Families Party\u2019s director of federal affairs, said in a statement following Cisneros\u2019 concession. The runoff between Cuellar and Cisneros marked their third \u2013 and, with the final count now in \u2013 closest race. In 2020, she came within fewer than 4 percentage points of unseating him in a primary. This March, in a three-way primary, Cisneros finished second, denying Cuellar an outright majority and paving the way for their decisive runoff \u2013 and one more narrow loss. This story has been updated with additional information.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is growing increasingly irritated with the House panel investigating the January 6, 2021, riot as it lifts the curtain on some of its findings with public hearings that have garnered gavel-to-gavel cable coverage \u2013 much to the annoyance of the TV-obsessed former President. Tucked away at his Bedminster golf club, Trump has spent the past week venting his frustrations \u200bto nearly anyone who will listen. He has also taken his complaints about the committee on the road, lashing out at the congressional panel during a speech to conservatives in Nashville last Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Kevin didn\u2019t put anyone on the committee,\u201d Trump \u200bhas recently \u200bgriped to those around him, according to a GOP source with direct knowledge of the comments \u2013 a reference to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s decision to boycott the select committee after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two \u200bRepublican members he originally chose to sit on the panel. Trump\u2019s growing frustration with the absence of any hard core supporters on the select committee \u2013 which has given the panel uninterrupted air time and deprived Republicans of the ability to cross-examine witnesses \u200bin real time \u2013 is just the latest example of how the public hearings have gotten under his skin.\u200b The former President has previously complained about his lack of allies on the committee, though he has become especially exasperated over the last week with his inability to preemptively respond to the committee\u2019s findings without knowing what the panel plans to reveal during each hearing. Trump has also publicly and privately lashed out at former Vice President Mike Pence, whose chief of staff Marc Short and \u200bformer top White House lawyer Greg Jacob have \u200bboth been featured prominently in the select committee hearings, put\u200bting an unflattering spotlight on \u200bthe pressure campaign \u200bTrump directed at Pence and others as he desperately attempted to stay in power. And while Trump has been pleased by the counter-programming effort being waged by his Capitol Hill allies in conservative media and on social media, he has still felt the need to take matters into his own hands\u200b. He reacted to the committee\u2019s first prime-time hearing earlier this month with a lengthy 12-page rebuttal bashing the probe into the deadly Capitol riot \u200band devoted much of his 90-minute appearance at the Faith & Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority conference last week to slamming Pence and the committee\u2019s two Republican members \u2013 Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. As the former President contemplates launching another presidential bid \u2013 potentially before the midterm elections \u2013\u200b \u200bhe has also become hyper-sensitive to how the hearings are \u200bbeing received by viewers and voters alike, according to multiple Republicans close to Trump. The stakes are high: the investigation could not only cast Pence, one of his potential 2024 rivals, in a positive light as investigators underscore the former vice president\u2019s role in preventing a constitutional crisis, but it could also foreshadow potential legal trouble for Trump, \u200bwho is already grappling with multiple legal battles unrelated to his role in January 6. \u200b Stuck in this high pressure atmosphere, Trump has started to direct his anger at people both inside and outside his orbit, from McCarthy \u200band Pence to his former chief of staff Mark Meadows \u200band Attorney General Bill Barr. One of Trump\u2019s chief complaints as of late has centered on the lack of Republican representation on the committee \u2013 Cheney and Kinzinger, who were both appointed by Pelosi, are ardent Trump critics. McCarthy chose five Republicans for the panel, but Pelosi, in an unprecedented move, vetoed Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio from serving on the committee since they supported efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Not only has Trump privately vented about McCarthy opting to withdraw his remaining picks for the panel, but Trump also took that grievance public in a recent radio interview, though he did not mention McCarthy by name. \u201cUnfortunately, a bad decision was made,\u201d Trump told conservative talk show host Wayne Allyn Root. \u201cThis committee was a bad decision, not to have representation on that committee. That was a very, very foolish decision because you know, they try and pretend like they\u2019re legit, and only when you get into the inner workings you say, \u2018what kind of a thing is this? it\u2019s just a one-sided witch hunt.\u2019\u201d \u201cWe have no representation on this panel. We should certainly have some Republicans, real Republicans \u2026 We have nobody on that panel who can fight back,\u201d Trump said earlier in the interview. \u201cIn a way, the Republicans should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d The thinking among some of Trump\u2019s advisers \u2013 and even among a handful of far-right Republicans on Capitol Hill \u2013 is that it was a mistake to not have any GOP lawmakers inside the room pushing back in real time \u200bor providing insight to the former President and rest of the GOP conference as to what investigators planned to highlight in public hearings. Had Republicans been on the committee, they could have asked tough questions of witnesses, made procedural motions to disrupt the flow of the hearings, and would have had some advance knowledge of the subpoenas, taped depositions\u200b and other evidence collected by the panel. CNN previously reported that Trump was caught off guard by seeing his daughter, Ivanka Trump,\u200b and his son-in-law Jared Kushner appear in a video clip during the first televised hearing, even though he knew \u200bthey had both spoken with the committee. \u200bThe former President complained to aides at the time that his daughter\u2019s testimony was taken out of context and deliberately included to embarrass him, according to a person close to Trump. Some Republicans have also questioned whether a bipartisan commission to investigate January 6 would have been a better outcome for Trump and the GOP. At McCarthy\u2019s direction, GOP Rep. John Katko of New York hammered out a deal on a commission that would have required both parties to agree on subpoenas, forced the commission to finish up its work by the end of last year, and prevented any current politicians from serving on the investigative body. But McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell both opposed the commission, which ended up failing in the Senate and led Pelosi to establish a select committee instead. One GOP source called the move a \u201ctactical error.\u201d Jordan, however, defended McCarthy\u2019s decision-making and said the GOP leader had no choice but to boycott the select committee after what Pelosi did. After McCarthy made the decision, Republicans on Capitol Hill were quick to rally around the move. And McCarthy used the moment as a political opportunity to paint the investigation as a one-sided witch hunt, which has become the GOP\u2019s primary talking point. \u201cPelosi knew, when she wouldn\u2019t let the selections of the leader on the committee, she knew Kevin had no other choice,\u201d Jordan told CNN. \u201cYou\u2019re doing something that hasn\u2019t been done in the history of the country, and we\u2019re just supposed to go along with it? No.\u201d Still, even if most of the GOP has no regrets about McCarthy deciding to yank his remaining Republican picks from the committee, it could be problematic that Trump is second guessing McCarthy, who needs the former President\u2019s support to become speaker one day. And in the conservative radio interview, Trump went out of his way to make clear that he has only endorsed McCarthy for reelection \u200bbut not for speaker, a position McCarthy has long had his sights on and is expected to seek if Republicans retake the House this November. People close to Trump, who wants House Republicans to aggressively investigate President Joe Biden if they find themselves in power, say he has intentionally withheld a speakership endorsement to maintain leverage further down the road. \u201cNo, no, no. I haven\u2019t,\u201d Trump said, when the talk show host suggested he had endorsed McCarthy for speaker. \u201cNo, I endorsed him in his race. But I haven\u2019t endorsed anybody for speaker.\u201d Inside Trump\u2019s orbit, his anger towards another top Republican \u2013 Pence \u2013 has sown tension between allies who share his frustration with the visible role Pence aides have played in the public hearings and those who believe his attacks are both unwarranted and unhelpful. If Trump\u2019s goal is to dissuade Pence from potentially challenging him in a 2024 presidential primary, allies of the former vice president say it won\u2019t work, noting that Pence is going to make that decision for himself and apart from Trump\u2019s criticism. Still, Trump is expected to continue his onslaught this weekend when he appears at a campaign rally in Illinois for Republican incumbent Rep. Mary Miller, according to a GOP source close to Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t see him letting up on Mike anytime soon and, frankly, the more Mike is out there doing things with clear 2024 undertones, the more he is going to make trouble for himself,\u201d said a Trump adviser. At the same time, some in Trump\u2019s orbit still believe that Pence does not pose a legitimate threat in 2024, particularly if he runs against the former President. \u201cHe has no political window,\u201d another Trump adviser told CNN, referring to Pence\u2019s chances of a successful presidential bid. Pence, however, continues to walk a political tightrope. While the former vice president has not stood in the way of his former advisers testifying before the committee, he has also made a point to distance himself from the ongoing hearings, instead making a series of public appearances where he has focused on other issues like the economy and border security. He also rescheduled a long-planned visit to Capitol Hill to meet with the Republican Study Committee on Tuesday. The hearing would have not only been awkward timing for Pence, but also would have potentially put Republicans like Banks, the head of the RSC, in the crosshairs, which most Republicans are eager to avoid. While Pence declined an invitation to also appear in Nashville last week, he recently joined Gov. Mike DeWine in the critical battleground state of Ohio for a roundtable on oil and gas sectors and he delivered a policy-heavy speech at the University Club of Chicago on Monday, previewing his pitch to primary voters if he does seek the GOP presidential nomination. The former vice president has visited all three early voting states over the past year \u2013 some more than once \u2013 and is due to release a book about his time in the administration later this fall. During his appearance in Chicago on Monday, Pence repeatedly implored Republicans to keep the focus on the future \u2013 a stark contrast with Trump\u2019s almost singular focus on the 2020 election in his own public appearances. \u201cIn the days between now and Election Day, we need you to say yes \u2013 yes to the future, yes to a future of freedom and our cherished values. And the Republican Party must be the party of the future,\u201d Pence said. Committee members have said they could still issue a subpoena to try to compel Pence\u2019s cooperation with the ongoing investigation, but after last Thursday\u2019s hearing, multiple sources familiar with the probe acknowledged that remains unlikely at this stage. Pence, meanwhile, has offered little indication that he would testify voluntarily, either publicly or behind closed-doors, a move that would certainly escalate the currently one-sided confrontation with Trump with little political upside. But Pence isn\u2019t the only White House veteran caught in Trump\u2019s line of fire. The former President has also complained to allies about the content of text messages that Meadows provided to the committee before halting his cooperation. Messages to Trump\u2019s then-chief of staff from his own adult children, on-air allies at Fox News, and some of his staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill have revealed just how desperate some were for Trump to condemn the violence at the US Capitol in a timely manner \u2013 and their absolute exasperation with his initial response. Testimony from at least two former Meadows aides, Cassidy Hutchison and Alyssa Farah, has also proved critical in the ongoing January 6 probe, with Hutchison reportedly revealing in her closed-door deposition that Meadows burned papers in his office following a meeting with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania where the two men discussed efforts to reject the 2020 election results. Perry was the first person to connect the then-President with Justice Department attorney Jeffrey Clark, who Trump considered putting in charge of the top law enforcement agency to help implement plans to overturn his defeat.",

            "article_content": "Alabamians voting in Tuesday\u2019s runoff for the Republican Senate nomination will decide between the establishment candidate former President Donald Trump has endorsed in Katie Britt and the conservative who has long embraced Trump\u2019s brand of politics even though he is now at odds with the former President, US Rep. Mo Brooks. Alabama is one of several states across the South to hold elections Tuesday. Primaries in Virginia and runoff elections in Georgia will determine the general election matchups for a handful of the nation\u2019s most competitive congressional races in November\u2019s midterm elections. And Democrats in Washington, DC, will decide whether to nominate the city mayor for a third term. Here are six things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s elections: Tuesday\u2019s primary runoff for the GOP nod to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Shelby in Alabama will be another test of Trump\u2019s ability to steer open-seat GOP Senate primaries, after his preferred candidates won in Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Mo Brooks faces a monstrous climb in Alabama runoff against Trump-backed Katie Britt Britt, a former chief of staff to Shelby who went on to lead the Business Council of Alabama, and Brooks, a six-term congressman and member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, finished in the top two of the state\u2019s May primary to advance to the runoff, with Britt taking 45% to Brooks\u2019 29%. Trump had initially supported Brooks in the Senate race but rescinded that endorsement in March, citing the congressman\u2019s remarks at an August 2021 rally with Trump that Republicans needed to move past the 2020 election \u2013 an implicit break from Trump\u2019s lies about widespread voter fraud. Less than two weeks before the runoff, Trump endorsed Britt, saying in a statement that Brooks \u201cfoolishly started listening to the wrong consultants and not to the people.\u201d The decision, however, disappointed many of the former President\u2019s top supporters. Brooks has argued that he has a long history of supporting Trump\u2019s policies, and Tuesday\u2019s runoff will reveal if that will be enough to insulate him against the former President\u2019s criticism. Republicans will also choose a nominee Tuesday for Brooks\u2019 House seat in North Alabama \u2013 Madison County Commissioner Dale Strong and Army veteran Casey Wardynski are facing off in the 5th District primary runoff. Republican Glenn Youngkin\u2019s victory in Virginia\u2019s governor\u2019s race last year offered an early glimpse into just how much the political tide had turned against Democrats heading into the midterm elections. This year, the GOP is attempting to build on its gains in three races for Democratic-held House seats: Rep. Elaine Luria\u2019s Virginia Beach-based 2nd District, as well as Rep. Abigail Spanberger\u2019s 7th District and Rep. Jennifer Wexton\u2019s 10th District, both in northern Virginia. Glenn Youngkin wrote the GOP playbook to navigate the Trump factor. Can it be replicated in 2022? The state GOP allows Republican officials in each congressional district to decide how to choose their nominees. The 2nd and 7th Districts will hold primaries Tuesday, while the 10th District GOP chose retired Navy Capt. Hung Cao as its nominee in a ranked-choice, firehouse primary in May. In the 2nd District, Navy veteran and state Sen. Jen Kiggans has establishment support from the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is aligned with House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, and from New York Rep. Elise Stefanik\u2019s leadership PAC, as well as the campaign arm of the National Rifle Association. Navy veteran Jarome Bell is backed by far-right figures and groups, including former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Turning Point Action, the group affiliated with activist Charlie Kirk. In a tweet last year, Bell called for the execution of those involved with 2020 election fraud, even though there is no evidence of widespread fraud. Air Force veteran Tommy Altman is backed by North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn, a member of the House Freedom Caucus who lost his primary earlier this year. In the 7th District, the GOP race is wide open, with a field that includes state Sen. Bryce Reeves and Yesli Vega, a Prince William County supervisor and an auxiliary sheriff\u2019s deputy who is supported by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, the conservative activist and wife of US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Trump\u2019s biggest failure in a Republican primary to date came in Georgia, where candidates he supported failed to oust Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whom Trump had been targeting for more than a year. He gets another chance to gauge his influence on Georgia races Tuesday in runoffs for two House seats. In the Atlanta-area 6th District, Jake Evans, the Trump-endorsed former chairman of the State Ethics Commission, faces Marine veteran and emergency room doctor Rich McCormick, who is making his second bid for Congress. In the 10th District, which stretches east from Atlanta to the South Carolina border, the GOP runoff features Trump\u2019s pick, former Democratic state Rep. Vernon Jones, against businessman Mike Collins, who is the son of the late US Rep. Mac Collins and recently earned Kemp\u2019s endorsement. Jones originally ran for governor, before switching to the House race with Trump\u2019s encouragement. An endorsement from Stacey Abrams is one of the most sought-after in Democratic politics across the country and especially in Georgia, where she\u2019ll square off in November with Kemp for a second time. Abrams has endorsed in three Democratic primary runoffs for statewide offices Tuesday as she seeks to help shape the party\u2019s ticket this fall. 'She is our future': A Democratic rising star seeks to make history in Georgia's secretary of state race State Rep. Bee Nguyen, the daughter of Vietnamese immigrants, is Abrams\u2019 pick for secretary of state over former state Rep. Dee Dawkins-Haigler, who is Black and has said she believes support for Nguyen is the result of party leaders\u2019 efforts to diversify the Democratic ticket and appeal to more White voters in November. Dawkins-Haigler has the support of the three candidates who failed to make the runoff. The winner will take on Republican incumbent Brad Raffensperger and Libertarian Ted Metz, a former gubernatorial candidate, in November. In the lieutenant governor race, Abrams is backing lawyer Charlie Bailey. He is running against Kwanza Hall, who served briefly as a US congressman after winning a special election in 2020 to replace the late Rep. John Lewis. The nominee will face Republican state Sen. Burt Jones, who has been endorsed by Trump. Abrams has also endorsed state Rep. William Boddie for the Democratic nomination for labor commissioner over businesswoman Nicole Horn. Republican state Sen. Bruce Thompson awaits the winner in the fall. National Republicans have rallied around Jeremy Hunt, a 28-year-old graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point and a Black candidate in Georgia\u2019s plurality Black and rural 2nd District, in the race to take on longtime Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop. Hunt, who finished first in the May primary with 37% of the vote, faces Chris West, a 38-year-old attorney and former Georgia Air National Guard officer who is White. West is supported by some of the Republicans they faced in the primary. He has cast Hunt, a Fox commentator who recently moved to Columbus while taking Yale Law School classes online, as an outsider to the district. Herschel Walker and the record-setting year for Black Republicans Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has campaigned with Hunt, and the National Republican Congressional Committee listed him as an \u201cOn the Radar\u201d candidate on its program for promising recruits. He is among a number of Black Republican candidates \u2013 which also includes Wesley Hunt in Texas, John James in Michigan and Jennifer-Ruth Green in Indiana \u2013 attempting to win seats and diversify the party\u2019s congressional membership this year. Bishop has represented the Southwest Georgia district since 1993. Its large Black population and Bishop\u2019s status as a more conservative \u201cBlue Dog\u201d Democrat have made it one of the only rural Southern seats the party still holds. Bishop hasn\u2019t faced a truly competitive general election since 2010. But Georgia\u2019s redistricting process made the seat slightly more competitive, and Republicans hope that with economic and historical factors at their back, a wave election would carry them to victory in the district where former Democratic President Jimmy Carter resides. Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser faces three opponents in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary: DC Councilmembers Robert White and Trayon White and 2018 mayoral candidate James Butler. Bowser and Robert White are widely seen as the top contenders in the race. White has pledged to expand the district\u2019s government and guarantee a job to anyone who wants one. But with little public polling, it\u2019s not clear that DC residents are eager to deny Bowser\u2019s bid to become the first mayor to win three consecutive terms since Marion Barry in 1986. (Barry served four nonconsecutive terms in all.)",

            "article_content": "While the House January 6 committee is making its case to the American public that then-President Donald Trump ripped off donors with false fundraising pitches after the 2020 election, prosecutors would face higher hurdles if they were to pursue a criminal fraud case in court. \u201cIs it a grift? Yeah, it\u2019s a grift. But is a grift always illegal? Not necessarily,\u201d said Paul Pelletier, a former federal prosecutor who previously led the Justice Department\u2019s fraud section. One state attorney general, New York\u2019s Letitia James, has already said she will investigate the committee\u2019s allegations of fraud and potential misconduct. \u201cThe new details revealed tonight related to January 6 are disturbing,\u201d James tweeted hours after the committee\u2019s findings were made public this week. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to investigate allegations of fraud or potential misconduct in New York. This incident is no exception.\u201d During its hearing on Monday, the committee outlined a startling set of financial figures, alleging Trump had raised $250 million off false claims that the election was stolen. Much of that money was raised through dozens of daily email blasts sent between the election and January 6, 2021, with many donations coming in amounts of $20 or less, the committee said. Trump is weighing whether to announce a 2024 bid before the midterms. Advisers are divided on that timing Donors were encouraged to contribute to a so-called \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund,\u201d which did not exist and was simply a term used for marketing, the committee said. Most of the money ultimately went toward a PAC, called Save America, formed less than a week after the election, that distributed it to other political ventures. Some of the funds landed with the company that organized the January 6 rally and even to the Trump family business, the committee said. \u201cThe big lie was also a big ripoff,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, one of the Democrats on the panel. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who\u2019s the committee\u2019s chair, told CNN on Tuesday that there was still a question as to whether Trump and his family were themselves trying to benefit from the fundraising. \u201cObviously, quite a bit of the money went to the Trump Hotel. It went to non-profits associated with people who work for the President. And obviously, this was not the intent that a lot of the fundraising emails were being sent. So clearly, they were misled at best. And in some instances, they were just patently untrue,\u201d Thompson said. Attorney General Merrick Garland has already promised, in a speech marking the one-year anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, that the Justice Department will examine the financing behind the insurrection. Yet if the federal prosecutors were to pursue a case, they\u2019d need to answer many unknowns that the House left unanswered in its short presentation on Monday \u2013 and think through the implications of charging a fundraising operation for a sitting president running for reelection. \u201cIn a normal situation, could you get people charged criminally? Of course,\u201d said Adav Noti, legal director of the Campaign Legal Center, a non-profit government watchdog. \u201cThis is not a normal situation. We\u2019re talking, at the time, the sitting president of the United States. That\u2019s not a run-of-the-mill decision for the Department of Justice to make.\u201d \u201cDid people who gave that money think they were putting it into a perpetual account that could be drawn on by the campaign organizers for whatever they wanted? Maybe the donor wouldn\u2019t care about that, but the law cares,\u201d said Noti. As in all investigations, any potential criminal case would turn on the evidence, former prosecutors say. Trump-allied candidates threaten democracy as January 6 probe tries to protect it \u201cThere are two big complications off the bat\u201d with bringing a criminal case based on the fundraising emails, said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor who\u2019s a CNN senior legal analyst. \u201cWhat does the fine print say, and you have to tie the fraud specifically to whoever you want to charge.\u201d In the case of Trump, he could be layers removed from the person who wrote and sent the fundraising email, Honig said. Prosecutors would also face questions of whether there are victims willing to be witnesses in the case, and who, if anyone, intended to use the fundraising effort as a bait and switch. A fine-print disclosure on Trump\u2019s fundraising blasts stating that the money may go to a \u201crecount account\u201d only if a donation reached nearly $10,000 could further complicate a possible case. Other former public integrity prosecutors and white-collar attorneys agreed the possibility of a wire fraud criminal investigation looks clear \u2013 but bringing a case may not be as simple as it seems. \u201cI think the legal jeopardy for Trump world is pretty clear,\u201d Daniel Goldman, a lawyer who worked on the case against Trump during his impeachment proceedings related to January 6, said on CNN on Tuesday. \u201cPresumably Donald Trump didn\u2019t know that he was getting $250 million on a bogus claim. But it\u2019s harder to prove that with actual evidence than it is just to assert that.\u201d Goldman outlined how prosecutors would need to find donors and nail down that they had intended to donate to a legal defense fund, and that they had been victimized by having their money sent toward an unadvertised purpose. \u201cYou\u2019d show the legal defense fund doesn\u2019t exist. And you basically got a criminal case. It\u2019s a pretty textbook case of wire fraud,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThe more difficult thing is to attach this to Donald Trump.\u201d State prosecutors could be a likely route If the Justice Department ultimately didn\u2019t pursue the accusations, state-level law enforcement may be interested in them. James, in New York, who has built her political persona around conducting a years-long investigation into the Trump Organization, is already signaling that route. State attorneys general have consumer protection law they could deploy to investigate whether any donors were misled by the campaign solicitations, and they have recently focused on fundraising tactics involving the Trump campaign. Analysis: 112 million reasons why Donald Trump should be nervous about Ron DeSantis In an important test case of the scope of state attorneys general\u2019s power to investigate federal fundraising practices, four states, including New York, won a key ruling earlier this year related to WinRed, a company that processes online donations. Four attorneys general \u2013 from New York, Connecticut, Maryland and Minnesota \u2013 opened investigations into WinRed after The New York Times published an article detailing how the Trump campaign and WinRed used pre-checked boxes to sign donors up to make repeated contributions. The states sent subpoenas for records seeking information about clients who used the pre-checked boxes, complaints from donors and refunds that had been provided. WinRed sued to block the subpoenas, arguing that state consumer protection laws were preempted by the Federal Election Campaign Act. The Trump campaign refunded some of the donors. Earlier this year, a federal judge sided with the attorneys general and dismissed the lawsuit, saying they had the power to investigate federal campaigns. So far, there has been no public indication that federal prosecutors are scrutinizing the broader post-election fundraising that largely went to the political action committee Trump controls. But the inquiry is wide, according to grand jury requests shared with CNN. The Justice Department\u2019s January 6 grand jury investigation has sought information about Trump rally organizing and the campaign\u2019s use of Trump electors in battleground states where he lost the popular vote. Several months ago, the Justice Department also was looking into fundraising conducted for a different fund, Defending the Republic, which was promoted by the conservative attorney Sidney Powell, who was involved in Trump\u2019s legal challenges after the election. While Powell\u2019s attorney told CNN in January that she was cooperating with the inquiry, it\u2019s unclear where that investigation now stands. Historically, the Justice Department has used its public corruption prosecutors to bring cases against political fundraising scams, including in the border wall charity investigation where Steve Bannon was indicted. Trump pardoned Bannon at the end of his presidency. Judge rejects Steve Bannon's motion to throw out contempt of Congress charges In the We Build the Wall case the alleged deception was explicit and the men took steps to try to conceal their wrongdoing, according to the indictment. Prosecutors allege the men falsely told the public in donor solicitations, public statements and on social media that \u201c100% of the funds raised\u201d would be used for construction of the wall and not a \u201cpenny\u201d would be used to compensate Brian Kolfage, a US veteran working with Bannon on the wall effort. Instead, prosecutors alleged, Kolfage and Bannon used shell companies to route hundreds of thousands of dollars to themselves, which were used to cover personal expenses. Kolfage pleaded guilty in April and is awaiting sentencing. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office is investigating Bannon and whether he violated state laws with his role in the fundraising effort, CNN has reported. Recently, several people in Bannon\u2019s \u201cimmediate circle\u201d were subpoenaed to appear before a state grand jury, sources told CNN. Asked previously about the grand jury subpoenas, Bannon\u2019s attorney Robert Costello told CNN: \u201cI am unaware of these matters.\u201d In other schemes, sometimes known as \u201cscam PACs,\u201d prosecutors say the misdirection is often brazen. In one, a Maryland political consultant took in donations for specific purposes to support candidates. Yet he never intended to spend the money on what was advertised, and instead put donations toward asking for more donations. He received a prison sentence of three years. In another case announced last year, three men associated with PACs were accused of soliciting donations for 2016 presidential candidates, but the money went to benefit them personally. One of the three men has pleaded guilty. CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles and Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican Mayra Flores will win the special election for Texas\u2019 34th Congressional District, CNN projects, giving Republicans an additional seat in the House. Flores will best a field of four candidates \u2013 two Republicans and two Democrats \u2013 in the all-party contest to succeed former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who vacated his South Texas seat in March to join a law and lobbying firm in Washington. Flores will serve out the remainder of Vela\u2019s term, until January. \u201cThis win is for the people who were ignored for so long! This is a message that the establishment will no longer be tolerated! We have officially started the red wave!!\u201d the Flores campaign wrote on Facebook Tuesday night. Her top Democratic opponent, Dan Sanchez, conceded the race the same night. 5 takeaways from Tuesday's elections in South Carolina, Nevada, Texas, Maine and North Dakota Flores will be the first Mexican-born woman elected to Congress. She benefited from a significant investment by national Republicans and relative indifference from Democrats, who were outspent by an estimated 20 to 1. Republicans zeroed in on the race as part of an effort to project growing strength with moderate and conservative Hispanic voters in South Texas. The National Republican Congressional Committee on Wednesday called Flores\u2019 win a \u201cblue print for success in South Texas,\u201d according to a memo obtained by CNN. But Flores\u2019 stay on Capitol Hill might be a short one \u2013 she will be up for election for a full term in November against Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who is shifting from the 15th Congressional District. The redrawn 34th District is considerably friendlier to Democrats \u2013 while now-President Joe Biden won the seat under its current lines by 4 points in 2020, he would have won the new version by about 16 points. \u201cA Democrat will represent TX-34 in January. If Republicans spend money on a seat that is out of their reach in November, great,\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Monica Robinson told CNN before the special election. The committee dipped into the race late, spending $100,000 on digital ads earlier this month. The lack of support for Sanchez frustrated Gonzalez, who told Politico weeks ago that it would \u201cbe a tragedy\u201d if the seat turned red for any amount of time. In a statement earlier Tuesday, he welcomed the late interest in the contest but demanded more. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see Democrats mobilizing around this race,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cbut South Texas needs sustained investment from the party.\u201d Sanchez, in a statement conceding the race hours later, was less diplomatic. He expressed confidence that Gonzalez would win in November and denounced \u201cout of state interests\u201d for financially backing Flores, but also called out his own party. \u201cToo many factors were against us,\u201d the former Cameron County commissioner said, \u201cincluding too little to no support from the National Democratic Party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\u201d Republicans and allied outside groups made more significant commitments to Flores, using the campaign to give her a head start in the fall and, beyond the district\u2019s shifting borders, to help bolster their broader attacks on national Democrats. \u201cThis election was a referendum on Democrats\u2019 reckless policies that created a border crisis, led to record-high inflation, and sent gas prices soaring,\u201d National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Tom Emmer said in a statement after Flores\u2019 win. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the historical significance of Flores\u2019 win. She will be the first Mexican-born woman elected to Congress.

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently counseled rank-and-file Republicans in private to largely ignore the investigation into the Capitol riot and stay focused on the issues that are top of mind to voters, like gas prices and inflation, GOP sources told CNN. But over the past week, some of Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s fiercest acolytes on Capitol Hill have been jockeying to prove their loyalty to the former President by waging a full-scale attack against the select committee, using news conferences, social media posts and conservative-friendly cable news appearances to blame Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the security failures on January 6, 2021, and accuse Democrats of a political witch hunt designed to damage Trump. And in the coming days, sources involved in the GOP\u2019s messaging effort say Trump\u2019s allies plan to turn up the heat on one of the former President\u2019s favorite top targets: GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the vice chairwoman of the select committee who has been leading the panel\u2019s public hearings on the Capitol Hill insurrection. \u201cCertainly, for some people, in some districts, there are political upsides\u201d to defending Trump, said veteran Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the GOP leadership team. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of their calculation. But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s why they\u2019re doing it. I think they just feel strongly about the manner, in which, the committee was formed, and the manner in which it\u2019s being operated.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got passionate people \u2013 and you always do in politics \u2013 you\u2019re gonna get some pushback,\u201d Cole added. While the majority of Republicans aren\u2019t sweating the select committee\u2019s findings and whether it will impact the midterm elections, there\u2019s a clutch of Republicans who see other benefits to serving as Trump\u2019s chief defender during a string of public hearings centered on his role in the Capitol attack. That includes McCarthy, who is under pressure to show his MAGA bona fides after privately criticizing Trump\u2019s role in January 6 immediately after the attack; Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Jim Banks of Indiana, who both have their eyes on higher GOP leadership positions next year; Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois, who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenger after voting to support a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol attack; and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who is in line to chair the powerful House Judiciary Committee if Republicans win the majority. McCarthy and Jordan have both been subpoenaed by the select committee but have not complied. These GOP lawmakers see a prime opportunity to please the former President and his staunchest supporters, which could earn them rewards inside a party where Trump remains popular. And they believe there\u2019s little political downside to becoming the face of the GOP\u2019s opposition to the January 6 probe, even as the select committee has teased potentially damning revelations about Trump and some of their Republican colleagues. January 6 committee postpones Wednesday hearing So far, their campaign to mollify Trump appears to be working. Trump \u2013 who pressed his Capitol Hill allies to defend him prior to the hearings \u2013 has been satisfied with the public response from GOP lawmakers, according to a Republican source familiar with this thinking. When asked by CNN about the GOP response effort thus far, Stefanik responded: \u201cI think we\u2019re doing great.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re pointing out that this is an illegitimate committee. There\u2019s no opportunity for Republican-appointed members to ask important cross examination questions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut most importantly, I think the American people in terms of the issues they\u2019re paying attention to, it\u2019s still inflation, the border, crime, gas prices. And no amount of these primetime hearings is going to change that.\u201d There\u2019s a precedent for landing in Trump\u2019s good graces by publicly fighting for the former president in times of crisis. During Trump\u2019s first impeachment, Stefanik \u2013 then a third-term member serving on the House Intelligence Committee \u2013 emerged as one of Trump\u2019s loudest defenders, raising her national profile and earning her a prominent place on the then-President\u2019s radar. Since then, Stefanik has become a successful fundraiser and was elevated to the position of House GOP conference chair, replacing Cheney as the No. 3 House Republican. Now, as Trump faces a potentially damning slew of revelations surrounding his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his Republican supporters are eagerly vying to act as his shield on Capitol Hill, blanketing the airwaves and blasting out tweets with their carefully coordinated counter attack. And most of the GOP\u2019s counter programming effort has been launched in right-wing media outlets, where Trump is more likely to be watching. The Republicans playing the biggest roles in the GOP\u2019s response to the hearings are members of leadership and Republicans who were initially tapped by McCarthy to serve on the select committee. And some of them, including the GOP leader himself, have an added incentive to show their support for Trump. McCarthy, who has been leading the party\u2019s response effort to the January 6 hearings and wants to become speaker one day, was caught on tape privately bashing Trump in the immediate wake of January 6. At the time, he said Trump bore some responsibility for the attack and told other GOP leaders he was going to have a conversation with Trump about resigning. But at a news conference last Thursday where the GOP presented its official pre-buttal to the select committee\u2019s hearings and investigation, McCarthy stood firmly in Trump\u2019s corner. \u201cI thought everybody in the country bears some responsibility, based upon what has been going on, the riots on the streets, the others,\u201d McCarthy said, when asked by CNN if he still believes Trump was in any way to blame for January 6. Also on stage at that same news conference was Stefanik, who at the behest of Trump is reprising her role as one of his public defenders. Stefanik \u2013 whom Trump feted at a fundraiser in New York last week \u2013 has been leading the party\u2019s messaging efforts and dispersing talking points aimed at undermining the select committee. Donald Trump endorses Kevin McCarthy for another term in Congress It\u2019s just the latest example of how Stefanik has transformed from a moderate Republican to a MAGA fighter as she looks to position herself inside the party. While Stefanik hasn\u2019t made a decision about her future political ambitions, some Republicans think Stefanik may run for GOP whip, which is expected to be an open position if Republicans recapture the House majority. But Stefanik could also seek the gavel on the House Education and Labor Committee or remain as conference chairwoman. She is also being eyed by Trump as a potential running mate if he launches another presidential bid. If Stefanik does run for GOP whip, she may have to compete with Banks, another Trump ally who has also been looking at the job and is playing a similarly prominent role in the party\u2019s January 6 messaging efforts. Banks was supposed to be the ranking Republican member on the select committee but was rejected by Pelosi over his support of Trump\u2019s election lies, which has been central to the panel\u2019s investigation. Republican lawmakers say an obvious rivalry has developed between Stefanik and Banks in recent months. But they have been able to set their differences aside during the select committee hearings, appearing on stage together at two separate GOP news conferences last week. Stefanik regularly invites lawmakers to weekly leadership news conferences, known as stakeouts, based upon who is best suited to help deliver that week\u2019s party message. She also blasted out an internal messaging alert ahead of the first hearing with talking points that were compiled in part by the Republican Study Committee, which Banks chairs. Still, some have suggested that Stefanik and Banks are using their counter attacks on the hearings as a way to lay claim to the MAGA mantel. As one senior GOP lawmaker put it: \u201cThey\u2019re marking their territory.\u201d Another GOP source dismissed the idea anyone stands to see a major profile or fundraising boost from rallying around Trump, arguing Republican voters are less invested in the January 6 hearings than they were with Trump\u2019s first impeachment, when his presidency seemed to be at risk. But some aren\u2019t looking to get a major boost. Davis \u2013 another one of McCarthy\u2019s original picks for the panel \u2013 has been aiming to improve his standing with conservatives after voting for a bipartisan commission to investigate the attack on the Capitol. Davis later voted against the creation of the select committee, and since then, he has used his top perch on the House Administration Committee to rail against the panel\u2019s investigation. He and Banks are also conducting their own investigation into the security failures on January 6, with a report on their findings expected to be released soon. And he has promised to use his subpoena powers to continue pursuing that investigation if Republicans are in charge of the House next year. Back home, Davis is facing a primary challenge from GOP Rep. Mary Miller, a member of the ultra conservative House Freedom Caucus who decided to challenge Davis after redistricting and has earned a Trump endorsement. She has used Davis\u2019 vote for the commission against him, while Davis has pointed out that she wasn\u2019t present for the vote on the select committee, which he voted against. McCarthy has also rallied around Davis, his close ally, and said voters shouldn\u2019t punish any of the Republicans who supported the commission. \u201cMembers have a right to vote however they want,\u201d McCarthy said at a news conference, as Davis stood behind him.",

            "article_content": "Two South Carolina Republicans will attempt to hold on to their seats in primaries Tuesday after breaking with former President Donald Trump over his lies about the 2020 election and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. Nevada, meanwhile, showcases Trump\u2019s effort to take over the election machinery in a series of battleground states, as his endorsed candidates attempt to win a slate of statewide primaries. In Texas, voters in the Rio Grande Valley will fill a seat in Congress in a special election. In Maine, they will tee up two midterm races that are expected to be hard-fought battles. And in North Dakota, Republican Sen. John Hoeven is poised to be nominated for another term. Here are five things to watch Tuesday: Can a Republican House member from a deep red state who voted to impeach Trump, as Rep. Tom Rice did after the Capitol riot, win a GOP primary in 2022? The first test will come on Tuesday, when Rice, perhaps the most surprising name on the list of 10 Republican members who joined Democrats in impeaching Trump, faces six challengers \u2013 led by state Rep. Russell Fry, who has the former President\u2019s endorsement. Rice is the rare Republican who initially condemned Trump after the insurrection, voted to impeach him afterward and continues to be critical of Trump even as he fights for his political life. His bet: that his deeply conservative record will win out in a district that previously has elected him five times. Trump has been typically bombastic in his denunciations of Rice, who had been a staunch ally until the insurrection, a \u201ccoward who abandoned his constituents by caving to (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left\u201d over Rice\u2019s vote to impeach. If none of the primary candidates wins a clear majority, the top two vote-getters will match up in a runoff, on June 28, to decide the nomination. Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina has been more circumspect talking about Trump, but her initial response to the Capitol riot helped seed a challenge from Katie Arrington, a former state representative and GOP congressional nominee who lost this seat to Democrat Joe Cunningham in 2018. Two years later, Mace defeated Cunningham and, in one of her first acts as a member of Congress, refused to object to the 2020 election results. She responded to the deadly violence on January 6 \u2013 which took place only days after she was sworn in \u2013 in an interview shortly thereafter, saying Trump had \u201cwiped out\u201d his \u201centire legacy\u201d with his actions ahead of the insurrection. South Carolina voters will decide Tuesday whether to exact Trump's vengeance on two GOP members of Congress Since then, Mace has sought to soften her position and play up her loyalty to the former President. She did not vote to impeach Trump and she aggressively pursued rhetorical clashes with prominent Democratic lawmakers, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But Trump, again, has been unsparing. He endorsed Arrington in February, calling her policies \u201cperfect\u201d and, in a statement, claimed that \u201cshe has the tremendous backing of almost all who know her \u2013 especially when she is compared to Nancy Mace!\u201d Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s appointee as ambassador to the United Nations and a potential 2024 presidential candidate, is not among them. She endorsed and campaigned for Mace ahead of the vote, creating a proxy battle of sorts in the coastal district. Trump\u2019s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election loom over a series of statewide primaries in Nevada, where Trump-endorsed candidates who have embraced those falsehoods are seeking to advance in one of the most competitive states on the 2022 midterm map. If the Trump-backed candidates win, it would move the former President one step closer to his goal of taking over election administration across a series of swing states. Former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt is the favorite to face Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto \u2013 a first-term Democrat who is expected to be among the party\u2019s most vulnerable members in November. Laxalt, who has Trump\u2019s endorsement and a famous last name in the state (he is the grandson of former governor and senator Paul Laxalt), led Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state. He faces a stronger-than-expected challenge from Sam Brown, a retired Army captain who received a Purple Heart after being badly burned in Afghanistan. Brown has cast Laxalt as a tool of the political establishment and pointed to Laxalt\u2019s loss in the 2018 governor\u2019s race as evidence he\u2019d fare poorly against Cortez Masto. Brown has gained traction among the state\u2019s GOP grassroots and received an endorsement from the Nevada Republican Party. The Republican race to take on Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak is also competitive. Trump backed Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo. Long viewed as the GOP front-runner, Lombardo has acknowledged that Joe Biden is the duly elected president but said he supports repealing the state\u2019s universal mail-in voting system. Trump chose him over two other Republicans \u2013 attorney and former boxer Joey Gilbert and former US Sen. Dean Heller \u2013 who have also aligned themselves with the former President. The race for the Republican nomination for secretary of state also features a candidate who has embraced Trump\u2019s election lies in former state lawmaker Jim Marchant. Democrats, meanwhile, have coalesced around Cisco Aguilar, an attorney who once worked for former Sen. Harry Reid. They are running to replace term-limited Republican Barbara Cegavske, who rejected Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn voters\u2019 will in 2020. Republicans will also choose challengers in three Las Vegas-area congressional districts. Those districts\u2019 political makeups favor Democrats, but in a political environment expected to favor Republicans, they could turn into critical races in November\u2019s battle for House control. If it\u2019s Tuesday, it must be Election Day in Texas. This time, it is a special election to fill out the remainder of the term of former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who resigned earlier this year to take a job with a lobbying firm. The winner of the four-person contest, which could go to a runoff if no one clears 50%, will be guaranteed only a few months on Capitol Hill. Republican activist Mayra Flores is running in both the special and November\u2019s general election. But she will face different electorates in those races, as redistricting alters the 34th Congressional District\u2019s borders in the fall \u2013 a change that will benefit Democratic nominee Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who currently represents the adjacent 15th Congressional District. But Gonzalez isn\u2019t on the ballot on Tuesday. Instead, former Cameron County commissioner Dan Sanchez is the leading Democratic candidate. He will not seek reelection if he wins. Picking up on the unexpected jumble, Republicans have spent heavily in the district, hoping to send a message about GOP support in the border region and create momentum ahead of the general election. Maine is set to tee up a governor\u2019s race to watch, with bombastic former Republican Gov. Paul LePage attempting a comeback against Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. It\u2019s the latest chapter in years of battles between the two that began when LePage was governor and Mills was attorney general. The two are unopposed in their primaries, so Tuesday is a mere formality. The race to watch in Maine, though, is the 2nd District GOP primary, the winner of which will take on Democratic Rep. Jared Golden. Former Rep. Bruce Poliquin is facing veteran Caratunk Selectwoman Liz Caruso, who has raised little money but has a base of energetic GOP activist supporters. Maine\u2019s history of an independent streak could make this race a focal point in the battle for House control this fall. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the endorsements Jim Marchant has received in his 2022 race for Nevada secretary of state. It also misstated the date slated for runoffs in South Carolina.",

            "article_content": "South Texas returns to the polls on Tuesday for a special election to replace a Democratic House member who resigned earlier this year, setting up a surprisingly expensive race to fill out the remaining months of his term. Former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela\u2019s decision to leave office at the end of March to take a job at a lobbying firm created a scramble for control of the current 34th Congressional District. The seat, which ranges from east of San Antonio down to Brownsville, largely along the Gulf Coast before reaching the US-Mexico border, has been vacant for more than two months and will effectively disappear in the fall, when a redrawn district more friendly to the Democratic nominee, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who currently represents the 15th Congressional District, comes up for grabs again. Gonzalez will not be on the ballot this time around. Instead, Democrat Dan Sanchez, the former Cameron County commissioner, is vying for a brief stay on Capitol Hill. His competition \u2013 and Gonzalez\u2019s in November \u2013 is Republican Mayra Flores. Despite the seemingly low stakes, Republicans have spent big on the race in a bid to cut into the Democratic majority, make a show of strength in the region and provide Flores with some momentum heading into the general election. Further complicating matters, Flores and Sanchez are not the only two running in the special election. Democrat Rene Coronado and Republican Juana Cantu-Cabrera are also on the ballot, meaning the contest could go to a runoff if none of the candidates win a majority of the votes. President Joe Biden won the district as it is currently drawn by less than 5 percentage points. After redistricting goes into effect, though, Democrats will face a more advantageous electorate. Given that, national Democrats have mostly steered clear of the special election. Flores has overwhelmingly outraised Sanchez and had, according to a finance report from the end of May, outspent him by a more than 20-to-1 margin. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s House election arm, only dipped into the race earlier this month, when it spent $100,000 on digital ads in the region. \u201cA Democrat will represent TX-34 in January. If Republicans spend money on a seat that is out of their reach in November, great,\u201d DCCC spokesperson Monica Robinson told CNN, calling Flores \u201ca far-right, MAGA extremist who is completely out of touch with South Texans, so the DCCC is focused on winning seats in November and we are committed to ensuring Hispanic voters get the representation they deserve when Vicente Gonzalez is elected to a full term this fall.\u201d Though the party remains confident of its position in the fall, Gonzalez has expressed some concern over Tuesday\u2019s contest, telling Politico earlier this month that it would \u201cbe a tragedy\u201d if the seat \u2013 in the increasingly competitive border region \u2013 turns red. Gonzalez did not return a request for comment from CNN. Despite the flood of cash backing Flores, Sanchez campaign manager Collin Steele, who previously held the same position for Gonzalez, says Sanchez\u2019s history in the district will ultimately be more valuable than GOP spending on the race. \u201cHis support is local. His money\u2019s coming from local sources,\u201d Steele said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019ll keep this in a runoff. I would love to win outright, but I think the most realistic outcome is that he\u2019ll overcome that money disadvantage because of those close community ties.\u201d 5 things to watch Tuesday in primaries in South Carolina, Nevada, Maine and more Republicans, meanwhile, view the race as both an opportunity to build strength in South Texas, where the party has seen signs of growing strength among more traditionally moderate and conservative parts of the Hispanic electorate, and deliver another hit to President Joe Biden and national Democrats ahead of the November midterms. \u201cThis election will show that voters in Texas\u2019 34th District are tired of Democrats\u2019 incompetence at the border and record-high inflation,\u201d National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair said. \u201cTexans and voters across the country know Democrat policies are making their lives worse, and will vote Republican.\u201d Flores did not return a request for comment from CNN. Vela\u2019s unexpected departure and the resulting fight to finish his term is only the latest headache he\u2019s caused for Democratic House leadership. He was one of nine members who, in August 2021, helped derail Democratic plans to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill in tandem with Biden\u2019s social spending package. The group demanded in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that she should move ahead with the infrastructure bill \u2013 a route Democrats eventually took \u2013 and worry about passing the larger legislation later. As angry progressives predicted, decoupling the two bills effectively killed the latter. Infrastructure ultimately passed the House and Senate, but Biden\u2019s Build Back Better package never made it to his desk, stalling out in the Senate and depriving the White House of what would have been its signature legislative achievement.",

            "article_content": "In an odd twist of scheduling, President Joe Biden was meeting here Thursday with a leader who\u2019s amplified conspiracy theories the very same hour that startling new details emerged about the conspiracy to deny him the presidency. Biden had for months been averse to engaging Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro, who US officials fear is parroting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud to undermine Brazil\u2019s system ahead of his own reelection bid this fall. But in order to lure him to Los Angeles for a summit of regional leaders that was plagued by boycotts, Biden agreed to a one-on-one meeting. And so, on Thursday afternoon, Biden found himself in a conference room alongside a man who, two days earlier, had deemed his 2020 victory \u201csuspicious.\u201d Meanwhile, back in Washington, the House committee investigating attempts to overturn that election was putting the finishing touches on its blockbuster public hearing. \u201cI\u2019m anxious to hear what\u2019s on your mind and talk about whatever you want to talk about,\u201d Biden told Bolsonaro somewhat obliquely before their meeting. \u201cI\u2019d like to listen as well as raise a few issues that are of, I think, mutual interest to us.\u201d Biden\u2019s meeting with Bolsonaro demonstrated the lengths he was willing to go to in order to offer a unified picture of the Western Hemisphere at a conference where disunity was often on display. And its coincidental timing alongside the House hearing on the events of January 6, 2021 \u2013 where the autocratic tendencies of the previous US President were exposed in sometimes-shocking fashion \u2013 laid bare the difficulty in using America\u2019s example to promote democracy in an increasingly fractured region. Biden was able to secure some important commitments this week, including an agreement on migration that came together at the last minute. But questions over attendance and the region\u2019s disparate priorities were still on ample display. And Biden\u2019s political struggles were never far from the surface. Here are three takeaways from this week\u2019s Summit of the Americas. Trump lingered over this week\u2019s summit in Southern California like the June gloom, from his Brazilian prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to the hearing exposing his disinformation scheme to the persistent questions about American commitment in a region he mostly ignored. Biden actively and explicitly worked to convince his counterparts that he was adopting his own, different approach. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a means by which we can maybe undo some of the damage done the previous four years, when it wasn\u2019t very much taken seriously \u2013 the relationships,\u201d he said while meeting with leaders from the Caribbean. A little while later, he said during the summit\u2019s opening plenary session that he wanted to discuss \u201cproposals that I think are a far cry from what we saw from our previous American administration.\u201d This week\u2019s summit amounted to the type of presidential work Trump found little use for during his time in office. He skipped the Summit of the Americas when he was in office and complained to his aides about attending the G7 and G20 meetings, questioning their point. Even President Barack Obama sometimes dreaded the kind of massive summit where he was left to sit for hours listening to endless speeches by other world leaders. He was often seen chomping away on nicotine gum as he took his seat. There was little question that Biden would reverse that trend. He said this week that he had often reminded Obama that \u201call politics is personal\u201d \u2014 and that actually accomplishing anything required showing up in person. \u201cIt makes a difference when you get to know someone,\u201d he said at the start of a dinner he hosted in the Getty Villa\u2019s Mediterranean gardens, near Malibu. \u201cWhether you agree or not, it makes a difference to look in their eyes and understand a little bit more what\u2019s in their heart.\u201d Biden was in fact so absorbed in meeting his fellow leaders that he missed Thursday night\u2019s January 6 hearing in its entirety, despite telling the Canadian Prime Minister earlier in the day that the event would \u201coccupy my country.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t have time,\u201d Biden said with a shrug when CNN asked whether he\u2019d caught any of the coverage. Biden arrived in Los Angeles hoping to use new economic and migration announcements to demonstrate cohesion in a region of fractured politics and, at times, entrenched skepticism of the United States. And by the time the summit was over, 20 leaders had signed on to an agreement that offers a road map for handling the region\u2019s large migration flows, perhaps the most significant accomplishment of a gathering whose relevance many had questioned ahead of time. Yet the decision of several leaders to boycott the summit, including the top officials from Mexico and three Central American countries the US has worked hard to cultivate, remained a visible sticking point. They refused to attend because Biden declined to extend invitations to the autocratic leaders of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. First on CNN: Biden administration launches 'unprecedented' operation to disrupt human smuggling as caravan moves north Heading into the summit, White House officials were frustrated that the drama over the participants appeared to be obscuring the important issues at stake. Yet when it came time for the leaders to gather inside the Los Angeles Convention Center, the discord was plain. And on Friday evening, first lady Jill Biden complained that the news coverage of her husband had been \u201cso unfair.\u201d \u201cEvery leader came up to Joe and said what a difference you\u2019ve made and say how we can work together,\u201d she told Democratic donors in a backyard in Brentwood. As Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris watched from mere feet away, Belize\u2019s Prime Minister called it \u201cinexcusable\u201d that all the countries of the Americas had not been invited. He said the power of the summit was \u201cdiminished\u201d by their absence. Argentine President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez said during a speech later in the program that the rules of future summits should be changed to prevent nations from being excluded. \u201cWe definitely would have wished for a different Summit of the Americas. The silence of those who were absent is calling to us,\u201d he added. The remarks did not come as a surprise to US officials, who were aware of the disagreements beforehand and anticipated that some leaders would air them publicly. Before the summit, some Biden aides suggested there would be a certain amount of political posturing among leaders who have domestic audiences that are often skeptical of the United States. And as he left the stage, Fern\u00e1ndez and Biden shared a friendly handshake, a sign that behind the scenes things were not as tense as they appeared. \u201cNotwithstanding the disagreements, think back to what we heard today,\u201d Biden said after sitting through his counterparts\u2019 speeches. \u201cWe heard almost total agreement on the substantive things that we should be doing.\u201d In the land of $7-per-gallon gasoline, Biden was never far from his biggest political liability. And while foreign policy can sometimes act as an escape hatch for politically imperiled presidents, a weakened US leader is not helped by boycotts and public shaming from his global counterparts. Many of the problems Biden hoped to address at his summit are potent political problems as well, including large flows of migrants on the southern border and inflation made worse by unreliable supply chains. During a pause from his summit hosting duties, Biden made a detour to the Port of Los Angeles to address what his team views as the most pressing current issue: high prices for everything from gas to groceries. Fact check: Biden falsely claims US has 'fastest-growing economy in the world' He assigned blame for rising costs to Russia, oil companies, shipping conglomerates and Republicans, insisting he is doing what he can to tame inflation as new numbers showed prices accelerating last month. To coincide with his trip West, Biden\u2019s aides booked an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late-night talk show, often viewed as an opportunity to show off a politician\u2019s lighter side. Yet Biden\u2019s appearance was a mostly serious interview on gun control and abortion rights, two other intractable issues on which the President has few options to act alone, even as his most ardent supporters demand he do so. \u201cI don\u2019t want to emulate Trump\u2019s abuse of the Constitution, constitutional authority,\u201d Biden told Kimmel on Wednesday after the late-night host asked why he couldn\u2019t issue an executive order like Trump, who \u201chanded them out like candy.\u201d When Kimmel asked how you play Monopoly when one side \u201cwon\u2019t pass go\u201d or play by the rules, Biden said: \u201cYou got to send \u2018em to jail.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Tuesday\u2019s primary elections in seven states will once again test whether Republican voters are willing to punish incumbents with track records of winning competitive races for failing to be sufficiently supportive of former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, in California, frustrations over crime and homelessness have shaped an effort to recall San Francisco\u2019s district attorney. And the Los Angeles mayor\u2019s race pits a billionaire Republican-turned-Democrat against a veteran congresswoman who was on President Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential short list. California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, New Jersey and South Dakota are all set to hold primaries Tuesday. In California, the top two finishers regardless of party will advance to November\u2019s general election; the other states\u2019 parties will select their nominees for the midterms. Here are eight things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s primaries: Can a former Republican real estate developer cash in his years of private power in Los Angeles to become the liberal bastion\u2019s next mayor? That is the question at stake in Southern California on Tuesday, where billionaire Rick Caruso is giving Rep. Karen Bass a stout challenge in their bids to be mayor of Los Angeles. Unease with crime and homelessness is lifting a billionaire developer in LA's mayor's race Caruso has poured millions of his own fortune into the race, pledging to tackle the city\u2019s pervasive homelessness, combat corruption and address the city\u2019s crime rate by increasing the size of the police force. In a television ad, the former Republican said he was running \u201cbecause the city we love is in a state of emergency,\u201d citing \u201crampant homelessness\u201d and \u201cpeople living in fear for their safety.\u201d Bass, a longtime congresswoman and former member of the California State Assembly, is highlighting many of the same issues \u2013 including crime and homelessness \u2013 but with a more progressive message and is touting her connection to the city. If she were to become Los Angeles\u2019 mayor, she would be the first woman to hold the office. There is a good chance this could be just the first time Caruso and Bass face off. If no candidate in the 12-person field gets 50% of the vote, the top two finishers in the race move on to a runoff in November. San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin was swept into office in 2019 on concerns over police misconduct, criminal justice reform and mass incarceration, a high point for the movement to elect more progressive prosecutors. Three years \u2013 and one pandemic \u2013 later, the winds have so dramatically shifted against the progressive district attorney and his lax approach to certain kinds of crime that he is facing a recall. The effort, and Boudin\u2019s time in office, cannot be separated from the coronavirus pandemic, which coincided with a rise in property crime rates in San Francisco. The recall is as much about the feeling among San Francisco residents as it is about crime rates \u2013 homelessness remains a persistent issue in the city as residents report feeling uncomfortable in large swaths of commercial areas because of drug use and crime. Boudin has sought to fight the effort by labeling it a natural reaction to the election of a progressive prosecutor, linking the effort to Republicans and police unions. But while Republican money is helping the effort, the push to recall Boudin was initially supported by Democrats. Across Tuesday\u2019s primary map, House Republicans are facing challengers who have cast doubt on their conservative bona fides and their loyalty to Trump. A guide to California's competitive House races In California, Rep. David Valadao \u2013 one of 10 Republicans to support Trump\u2019s 2021 impeachment \u2013 is facing a challenge from Republican Chris Mathys, who has campaigned as an ardent Trump supporter and made Valadao\u2019s vote his core argument against the incumbent. In South Dakota, a trio of statewide elected Republicans, Gov. Kristi Noem, Sen. John Thune and Rep. Dusty Johnson, face primaries from the right. The most serious challenge appears to be state Rep. Taffy Howard\u2019s effort to oust Johnson. She has embraced Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election results and criticized Johnson for voting to certify Electoral College votes. And in New Jersey, Rep. Chris Smith, who was first elected in 1980, is squaring off with conservative talk-radio host Mike Crispi and former FBI agent Steve Gray, who cast the veteran incumbent as too moderate. In 2018, Orange County offered Democrats what it had offered millions of people before: endless opportunity and significant promise. The party seized on anti-Republican sentiments and turned the historically Republican area \u2013 known politically as California\u2019s Orange Curtain \u2013 into a Democratic stronghold, winning all six congressional seats in the county that year. But times have changed. In 2020, Republicans won back two seats in Orange County \u2013 Michelle Steel and Young Kim defeated Democratic incumbents to flip two seats \u2013 and the party is hopeful it could win at least two other Orange County congressional seats this year, which could be a historically bad year for Democrats. The shift highlights how quickly the political landscape in an area can shift. In just four years, Democrats went from newly dominant in Orange County to notably threatened. The candidates might be new, but the names are not. New Jersey is home to some of the most powerful political machines in the country and, though a few have been rattled in recent election cycles, their strength is expected to be on display again this year. In northern Jersey\u2019s 8th Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Albio Sires\u2019 retirement announcement did not trigger a rush of candidates to the safe blue district across the Hudson River from New York City. Instead, Sires and other local leaders quickly endorsed Robert Menendez Jr., son of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez. The younger Menendez has vastly outraised and outspent the two other candidates, David Ocampo Grajales and Ane Roseborough-Eberhard. Nearby, in the heavily Democratic 10th Congressional District, Rep. Donald Payne Jr. is a strong favorite to win the nomination again despite a spirited challenge from Imani Oakley, the former New Jersey Working Families legislative director. Oakley\u2019s campaign was dealt a blow during a redistricting process that helped consolidate Payne\u2019s base. Akil Khalfani, director of the Africana Institute at Essex County College, is also in the race. He ran as an independent in the 2020 election, but won barely 1% of the vote. On the Republican side, the big race on Tuesday is in central Jersey\u2019s 7th Congressional District, where former state Senate Minority Leader Thomas Kean Jr., son of former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean, is the leader in a crowded field vying for a general election date with Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, who narrowly defeated Kean Jr. in 2020. But Malinowski, who has faced ethics questions, will have an uphill battle to win again after the seat was shorn of some Democratic strongholds during redistricting. Rep. Steven Palazzo, first elected to Congress during the tea party wave of 2010, faces six Republican primary challengers amid allegations he misspent hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign and congressional funds and used his office to help his brother\u2019s effort to reenlist in the Navy. Among his rivals in the Gulf Coast district, Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell and Hancock County businessman Clay Wagner are considered the most likely to, if not defeat Palazzo, then to send the race to a June 28 runoff. The winner on Tuesday needs more than 50% of the vote to clinch the nomination. State Sen. Brice Wiggins, Carl Boyanton, Kidron Peterson and Raymond Brooks are also in the running. In addition to the ethics controversies, Palazzo\u2019s opponents have criticized him over his attendance record in Congress. Despite publicly opposing proxy voting in the House, he has made good use of the option, exercising it dozens of times even after joining a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi trying to stop it. And in another potentially damaging episode, Palazzo made headlines last month when he bowed out of a candidate forum citing \u201cmeetings dealing with national security\u201d \u2013 then posted a picture online with his son at a restaurant during the event. The next occupant of former GOP Rep. Devin Nunes\u2019 onetime congressional district will be selected on Tuesday. The seat was vacated when Nunes, the controversial congressman who attempted to help Trump avoid scrutiny around Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election, decided to leave Congress to become CEO of Trump\u2019s media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The seat, which includes much of California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, leans toward Republicans and all indications are that Republican Connie Conway, the former minority leader in the California State Assembly, will win the race. She finished well ahead of Democrat Lourin Hubbard in the April primary. Former Rep. Ryan Zinke, who left his seat for a scandal-plagued tenure as Trump\u2019s interior secretary, is attempting a political comeback in Montana \u2013 but is facing familiar questions about whether he spends most of his time there or in California. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and Montana state senator who was first elected to the House in 2014 and reelected in 2016 before resigning to join Trump\u2019s Cabinet, is seizing on an opening created when the 2020 census results handed the Treasure State a second congressional district. Rep. Matt Rosendale, who holds the state\u2019s one at-large district seat, is running for reelection in the newly created 2nd District, while Zinke campaigns in the 1st District. But Zinke is facing criticism from rivals to his right over whether he was sufficiently supportive of Trump and the former President\u2019s effort to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. He also faces questions about whether he lives in Montana after Politico reported last month that his wife had claimed a home in Santa Barbara, California, as her primary residence on tax records and other forms. Zinke\u2019s campaign responded to the report by saying he lives in Whitefish, Montana, and that his wife had inherited and kept her parents\u2019 former home in California, of which she is the sole owner. Zinke faces four other candidates in Tuesday\u2019s primary, including former state Sen. Albert Olszewski and pastor Mary Todd.",

            "article_content": "Jessica Cisneros, the Democratic primary challenger to Rep. Henry Cuellar in Texas, says she plans to file for a recount of their runoff election. Cuellar leads by 197 votes out of more than 45,000 counted so far. \u201cWith just under 0.6 percent of the vote symbolizing such stark differences for the future in South Texas, I owe it to our community to see this through to the end,\u201d Cisneros said in a statement Monday. According to the latest CNN data, Cuellar currently has 22,788 votes to Cisneros\u2019 22,591 with an estimated 99% of the count completed. Cuellar, in a statement, said he welcomed a process that would \u201conly further verify our victory.\u201d \u201cMy opponent has every legal right to call for a recount though she has previously stated that she \u2018won\u2019t stop fighting until every vote has been counted.\u2019 Well, every vote has been counted. She has no path to victory,\u201d he said. The nominating contest in South Texas\u2019s 28th Congressional District, which ranges from parts of San Antonio down to Laredo and other border communities, has been among the most sharply fought and competitive of an election season already roiled by Democratic intra-party clashes. Cisneros, a progressive backed by movement leaders like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also ran against Cuellar in 2020. She lost then by about 3.6% in a one-on-one race. Cisneros narrowed the margin in a three-way race on March 1, coming within about 950 votes and denying Cuellar, who ended up with 48.6% to her 46.7%, the 50% majority required to clinch the nomination outright. Their runoff attracted another round of national attention and millions in outside spending, the lion\u2019s share of it from moderate and pro-Israel groups supporting Cuellar, the lone anti-abortion Democrat remaining in the House. Cuellar also had the backing of party leaders in Washington, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip James Clyburn.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has made it clear he is looking for cover from his closest allies around the upcoming public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection \u2013 and some prominent names in Congress and the Republican Party are answering the call. Trump\u2019s team has communicated to some of his most loyal acolytes on Capitol Hill that the former President wants people vigorously defending him and pushing back on the select committee while the public hearings play out, according to GOP sources familiar with the request. Committee members have teased that the hearings could be focused on Trump\u2019s direct role in undermining the election results. The committee has been working toward a thesis that Trump\u2019s obsession with losing the election and his peddling of false claims about the results is what laid the groundwork for the violent and deadly riot at the Capitol. Trump\u2019s insistence that his allies defend his honor has mobilized Republicans both on and off the Hill into action, with a broad range of plans to protect him. This despite the belief by some Republicans that they should draw attention away from January 6 and instead continue to beat the drum of the present day economic and cultural issues that have resonated with voters. In Congress, the targeted response to the hearings will be overseen by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who has been coordinating the response effort with GOP members. The California Republican is facing added pressure to show his support for Trump after he was caught on tape earlier this year criticizing the former President and some of his GOP colleagues in the immediate aftermath of the Capitol attack. The main player in keeping Republicans on message will be House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York, who emerged as one of Trump\u2019s loudest defenders during his first impeachment and replaced Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney in Republican leadership. Sources say Stefanik will be tasked with coordinating the party\u2019s messaging response and ensuring key allies and surrogates have talking points. \u201cJust like impeachment, at the urging of President Trump and his team, Stefanik is going to play an outsized role defending President Trump and House Republicans on the issue of election integrity,\u201d said a senior GOP source. Two members whom House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected from serving on the select committee will also play a key part on the messaging front: Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee; and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who had a hand in the effort to overturn the 2020 election results. CNN Exclusive: Republicans who texted Meadows with urgent pleas on January 6 say Trump could have stopped the violence \u201cWe\u2019re going to push back,\u201d Banks told CNN. \u201cThere were serious failures that occurred on January 6 that have got to be fixed. This sham committee hasn\u2019t done anything to address them.\u201d Banks and other Republicans, including Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois, the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, have also been working on their own counter investigation into January 6 that focuses squarely on the security failures from that day. Banks said they are putting the \u201cfinishing touches\u201d on a report outlining their findings and expect it to be released in \u201ca matter of weeks,\u201d which could coincide with the tail end of the select committee hearings. Part of the challenge for Republicans \u2014 especially after they decided to boycott the select committee \u2014 is that they have little insight into what the investigation has uncovered and what might be revealed in the public hearings, making it harder for them to settle on a precise strategy. Another is the prospect that the committee will lean heavily on testimony from former aides of Vice President Mike Pence to help make their case \u2013 a scenario that could force Republicans to choose sides in a more public way than they have done so previously. Trump allies and some Republican operatives are already expecting testimony from Pence\u2019s former aides to be featured prominently in the hearings \u2013 only adding to the already simmering animosity between the two camps. While the Republican House Conference has its plans, there is a more specific challenge for the five members who have been subpoenaed by the committee as part of their investigation. McCarthy, Jordan, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama and Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona have all resisted attempts by the committee to sit for depositions and provide documents as part of their investigation. All five run the risk that the committee has information about their role in the attempts to undermine the election results or the riot itself that could be revealed during the hearing. Jordan and other lawmakers have attempted to pre-but that risk, by attempting to define the committee and its work as nothing more than a partisan political witch hunt. Jordan has outlined this argument during calls with conservative donors organized by Republican fundraising groups, including CPAC. Trump-backed gubernatorial candidate was questioned by FBI after photos emerged of him on January 6 But those lawmakers and Republicans more broadly, are weighing whether they stand to benefit from a fulsome response \u2013 especially considering they were given the chance to testify behind closed doors and have all refused to date. From outside of the Hill, the Republican National Committee and Matt Schlapp, the chairman of Conservative Political Action Conference, are expected to be major players in the GOP\u2019s counter-attack, sources said. It\u2019s unclear, however, if Trump himself will make an appearance or publicly weigh in as the hearings are unfolding. While the party\u2019s plans are still being fleshed out, the Republican pushback is likely to take the form of news conferences, op-eds, cable news appearances and social media posts, sources familiar with the discussions said. There\u2019s also been talk of a \u201cwar room\u201d to better enable the GOP to unleash rapid, real-time responses to the hearings. Trump is scheduled to meet next week with many of the players where his personal strategy and demands could become clearer. He will host a fundraiser for Stefanik on Monday and then the next day, huddle with members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, which is home to some of his staunchest allies. But while the Republicans are willing to do Trump\u2019s bidding, there is real anxiety that pushing back too much will take focus away from the areas they believe will help them the most in the fall elections. \u201cWe just need to reinforce the narrative that the Democrats are obsessed with Trump and the past and they aren\u2019t interested in dealing with the problems of the present,\u201d said a senior Republican operative working on Senate races across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s Biden, it\u2019s inflation, it\u2019s the border, it\u2019s gas prices. Most Americans aren\u2019t talking about January 6th.\u201d Instead, some operatives are offering their clients talking points to prepare them for the inevitable questions that will arise around the hearing, but with the goal of steering the conversation back to domestic issues. \u201cWe need to deal with things as they come up, but the goal is to stay on message,\u201d the operative said. \u201cIf we do our job right, we will show that we are focused the issues that most Americans are dealing with every single day.\u201d Grand jury indicts former Trump adviser Peter Navarro for contempt of Congress That feeling is echoed by rank-and-file Republican members eager to reclaim the majority. \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t like what happened on January 6, but rate it pretty low on their importance list when compared to inflation, cost of gas, the border and crime,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who represents a Biden-won district, told CNN. \u201cOnce Pelosi kicked off two members on GOP side, which prior to this Congress has never been done in the history of the House, the perceived legitimacy of the Select Committee by our side is zero.\u201d Others within the party, including lawmakers and operatives, have suggested that the best course of action may be to do nothing because they believe most Republican voters are paying very little attention to the upcoming hearings and the presentations are considered unlikely to change the public opinion among the GOP base. \u201cA lot of people feel we should not even push back,\u201d a source said, adding the thinking is to just let the committee keep doing what it is doing because it is actually hurting members politically and having a very limited impact on Republicans. \u201cThere may be no competing, no formal push back in any way and no organizational cost because our power base isn\u2019t watching,\u201d they added. But as with anything in Republican politics, the best laid plans could easily be blown up by Trump who may insist that his supporters demonstrate their support vocally and without reservation.

            "article_content": "A federal grand jury has indicted former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro for contempt of Congress after he refused to cooperate in the House January 6 committee\u2019s investigation. During a court appearance in Washington, DC, on Friday, Navarro said that he still wants to represent himself without a lawyer and accused prosecutors of using \u201chardball\u201d tactics by arresting him at an airport and not allowing him to make a phone call. Navarro said he was arrested at a DC-area airport Friday on his way to Nashville. January 6 committee member says upcoming public hearings will \"blow the roof off the House\" He faces two contempt counts: one for his failure to produce documents demanded by the committee and the other for failing to show up for subpoenaed testimony before House investigators. The House had voted in April to refer Navarro to the Justice Department for not complying with the select committee\u2019s February subpoena. Navarro had claimed that he was unable to cooperate because former President Donald Trump had asserted executive privilege in the matter. The committee had countered those arguments by citing that many of the topics it wanted to discuss with him he had already written about in great detail in his book. Navarro is now the second former Trump adviser to be indicted for criminal contempt of Congress for defying a January 6 committee subpoena. The first referral from the House, for former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, was picked up by DOJ and has led to an indictment. He faces a criminal trial this summer. The Department of Justice on Friday informed the committee that it will not indict two other Trump allies referred for prosecution: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and ex-deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino. The Justice Department has come under pressure for from House Democrats and others on the left for not acting aggressively enough in its January 6 investigation, particularly as it concerns the role Trump and his inner circle played in seeking to overturn the election and in making the mass voter fraud that propelled the violent assault on the Capitol. There have been recent indications, however, that the department has ramped up its investigation into a scheme to put forward fraudulent slates of Trump-supporting electors in states that President Joe Biden won. At Friday\u2019s court appearance, Judge Zia Faruqui expressed concern about allowing Navarro to represent himself. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that you have counsel,\u201d the judge told him. Paul Ryan just slammed Republicans who didn't vote to impeach Donald Trump Navarro said he was OK with the judge appointing counsel \u201cfor today\u201d and that he sent prosecutors an email with an attorney contact as they work this out. Navarro, who has a Ph.D in economics, is not an attorney. \u201cThe arraignment should be postponed for a number of reasons,\u201d Navarro added, requesting that his civil lawsuit against the House January 6 committee go forward before any criminal proceedings. The court handling the civil case has already dinged Navarro for procedural flaws in how he structured the lawsuit. The Justice Department did not request that Navarro be detained and while he argued the conditions of release were too strict \u2013 telling Faruqui that he was \u201cno threat to anybody, not a flight risk\u201d \u2013 the judge largely disagreed but allowed him to keep his passport. Navarro will have to report to pretrial services, must notify pretrial if he is traveling, is not allowed to possess firearms or explosives and must get approval for travel outside the continental US. His next court appearance is scheduled for June 17. The new charges against Navarro focus narrowly on his lack of compliance with the House\u2019s investigation. The subpoena from the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia specifically requests \u201call documents relating to the subpoena dated February 9, 2022, that you received from the House Select Committee to investigate the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including but not limited to any communications with former President Trump and/or his counsel or representatives.\u201d In the indictment, prosecutors cite the repeated rejections Navarro received from the committee of his arguments for not complying with the subpoena. NY prosecutors are moving closer to charging Steve Bannon in border wall effort Trump pardoned him for In a February 27 email quoted by the indictment, the committee told Navarro that the committee believed that there were topics they could discuss \u201cwithout any raising executive privilege concerns at all.\u201d \u201cIn any event, you must appear to assert any executive privilege objections on a question-by-question basis during the deposition,\u201d the committee wrote. When the committee referred Navarro for criminal charges earlier this year, it accused him of making no effort to comply with its subpoena request, claiming that he made it clear that he was unable to cooperate because Trump had asserted executive privilege in the matter. Select committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson cited the executive privilege argument during Navarro\u2019s contempt hearing. \u201cThey potentially played a part in an attack on American democracy, but they can ignore our investigation because they worked for the government at the time. That\u2019s their argument,\u201d Thompson said at the time, referring to both Navarro and Scavino. \u201cThey\u2019re not fooling anybody. They are obligated to comply with our investigation. They have refused to do so. And that\u2019s a crime.\u201d The committee told Navarro that there were several topic areas it wanted to discuss with him that were not covered under privilege, but Navarro rejected the offer. Navarro also asked the committee if the proceedings would be held in public. He ultimately closed off communication with the committee and referred all questions regarding his cooperation to Trump and his attorneys. Navarro revealed Monday that he had been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors who were seeking documents related to his decision. Navarro said in an interview with MSNBC Thursday night that he \u201cresponded\u201d to the Justice Department, but he declined to say he would be willing to turn over the documents requested by prosecutors. In the MSNBC interview with Ari Melber, Navarro said he would \u201clead the charge\u201d to pursue charges against Biden and leading Democrats if Republicans win the White House in 2024. \u201cYou bet your a** that I will lead the charge,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cI will take Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin and Nancy Pelosi and Rosa DeLauro \u2013 all of those clowns and kangaroos \u2013 I\u2019ll take Biden and every single senior staff member in there\u2013\u201d \u201cAnd do what?\u201d Melber interjected. \u201cHit them with subpoenas,\u201d Navarro declared. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with the impeachment of Biden for Ukraine, the southern border, all manner of things he is guilty of and we\u2019ll subpoena his senior staff.\u201d Melber said he wanted to get on record whether Navarro, if he were to return to a position of authority in a Republican administration, would \u201cuse the Department of Justice to subpoena Democrats\u201d he doesn\u2019t like. \u201cI will push as hard as I can to use the same B.S. the Democrats are using now to try to put me in prison for standing up for principle,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cIf they want to play that game, we\u2019ll play it right back. They\u2019ll hit us, we hit them back harder. That\u2019s not what I want, Ari. Let me be clear. I do not want that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

            "article_content": "Former House Speaker Paul Ryan has largely disappeared from the national political scene. Which makes what he said earlier this week about the House vote to impeach Donald Trump in 2021 all the more notable. \u201cThere were a lot of people who wanted to vote like Tom but who just didn\u2019t have the guts to do it,\u201d Ryan said of South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice, who he had traveled to the state to endorse, according to the Myrtle Beach Sun News. \u201cThere are a lot of people who say they\u2019re going to vote their conscience, they\u2019re going to vote for the Constitution, they\u2019re going to vote for their convictions but when it gets hard to do that they don\u2019t do it.\u201d Rice is one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump following the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.  As I wrote at the time, Rice\u2019s vote caught Republicans by surprise as he had given little indication of his plan to break from his party. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! In a statement released by his office at the time, Rice explained his vote: \u201cOnce the violence began, when the Capitol was under siege, when the Capitol Police were being beaten and killed, and when the Vice President and the Congress were being locked down, the President was watching and tweeted about the Vice President\u2019s lack of courage. \u201cFor hours while the riot continued, the President communicated only on Twitter and offered only weak requests for restraint. \u2026 \u201c\u2026 It has been a week since so many were injured, the United States Capitol was ransacked, and six people were killed, including two police officers. Yet, the President has not addressed the nation to ask for calm. He has not visited the injured and grieving. He has not offered condolences. Yesterday in a press briefing at the border, he said his comments were \u2018perfectly appropriate.\u2019\u201d In a June 2021 profile of Rice in The Washington Post, he was more succinct about his vote: \u201cIt was very clear to me, I took an oath to defend the Constitution. I didn\u2019t take an oath to defend Donald Trump. What he did was a frontal assault on the Constitution.\u201d Trump, of course, disagrees. And as he has done with almost every one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him, the former President has endorsed a primary challenger to Rice. Of state Rep. Russell Fry, Trump said in February: \u201cRussell loves our Military and our Vets \u2014 he is strong on Border Security and Crime. Russell Fry, who is all in for the Palmetto State, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. VOTE TOM RICE OUT NOW!\u201d Ryan\u2019s appearance in South Carolina for Rice comes in advance of the state\u2019s June 14 primary. Rice has raised almost double what Frye has brought in over the course of the election cycle ($1.9 million raised for Rice, $767,000 for Fry). They are two of the seven candidates running for the Republican nomination in South Carolina\u2019s 7th Congressional District. For Ryan, his comments represent a clear criticism of not only the man who still runs the Republican Party, but also of many of the colleagues he once served with. While Ryan doesn\u2019t name any names, it\u2019s easy to imagine his critique being directed at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who hopes to be speaker come January 2023. See how the Capitol Riot on January 6 unfolded McCarthy was openly critical of Trump in the immediate aftermath of the January 6 riot. \u201cThe President bears responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s attack on Congress by mob rioters,\u201d McCarthy said on the House floor soon after the insurrection.  \u201cHe should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. These facts require immediate action by President Trump.\u201d We later learned that McCarthy had told House Republicans on a conference call several days later: \u201cI had it with this guy. What he did is unacceptable. Nobody can defend that, and nobody should defend it.\u201d McCarthy voted against impeachment. He has since tried to downplay Trump\u2019s actions on January 6. \u201cWhat I talked to President Trump about, I was the first person to contact him when the riots was going on,\u201d he said in interview on Fox in January. \u201cHe didn\u2019t see it. What he ended the call was saying \u2013 telling me, he\u2019ll put something out to make sure to stop this. And that\u2019s what he did, he put a video out later.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Administration officials are still scrambling to secure attendees and prepare announcements for President Joe Biden to make just one week before he hosts Western Hemisphere leaders in Los Angeles for an important regional summit. It\u2019s an unusually last-minute attempt to salvage what officials once described as a top-priority event for relations in the United States\u2019 own neighborhood. Absences from critical leaders \u2013 most notably the President of Mexico, who is threatening a boycott \u2013 risk undermining the gathering, even as Biden and his team look to make progress on politically sensitive issues like migration to the US\u2019 southern border and economic growth. Officials say the summit will proceed and have downplayed any anxieties about who might show up. They have begun finalizing the agenda and Biden\u2019s schedule for the multi-day gathering. Yet even before it begins, the summit\u2019s organizational squabbling has exposed rifts in a region where Biden once hoped to reassert US leadership. China is alarmed by the Quad. But its threats are driving the group closer together Next week\u2019s Summit of the Americas will mark the ninth meeting of countries in the region and the first time the US has hosted the gathering since it was inaugurated in Miami in 1994. The gathering of nations, stretching from Canada in the north to Chile in the south, offers an opportunity to strengthen ties at a moment of historic migration and as China works overtime to make inroads in the region. Both are critically important issues for Biden, who has framed competition with Beijing as the principal challenge for the coming decades and has struggled to get a handle on illegal border crossings. But the summit\u2019s success may be contingent on who attends. Last month, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said Mexico\u2019s participation will not be confirmed until the US invites every country in the hemisphere, arguing no country should be excluded from the summit. US officials have repeatedly said the autocratic governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela will not be invited to the summit due to their human rights records. But Mexico and other nations in the region have closer ties to those countries, and have called the invite decision exclusionary. Senior administration officials on Wednesday dismissed concerns about attendance to the upcoming Summit of the Americas, stressing instead the ongoing coordination among countries to tackle regional issues. \u201cWe still have some final considerations, but we will inform people publicly soon about the final invitation list,\u201d said Juan Gonzalez, senior director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve not been so focused on the who is and who isn\u2019t invited and more really on the outcomes that we want to achieve at the summit.\u201d Kevin O\u2019Reilly, the national coordinator for the Summit of the Americas, told lawmakers last week that Venezuela and Nicaragua have not been invited, but deferred to the White House on whether anyone from the Cuban regime has been invited. \u201cThat will be a decision for the White House to make,\u201d O\u2019Reilly told Sen. Marco Rubio, who asked about the guest list. The White House had been mulling an invitation to a Cuban representative, though has yet to confirm any decision. Cuba was not invited to early iterations of the Summit of the Americas in the 1990s but has participated in the last several versions. Then-President Barack Obama held a historic handshake and meeting with Raul Castro at the summit Panama hosted in 2015. The White House has refused to disclose an invite list, even in the days before the summit is due to begin. Pressed on whether weak attendance would hinder the summit\u2019s impact, Gonzalez maintained that the gathering will be \u201cwell attended\u201d and the relationship with Mexico will \u201cremain positive.\u201d The White House shrugged off questions about why details were being nailed down a week before the summit begins. \u201cI think if you\u2019ve been following this administration for the past year and a half, one week is not the eleventh hour when it comes to how things move. And so that is a lifetime away for us as a White House,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. Still, she seemed to acknowledge the questions about attendance had subsumed some of the summit\u2019s objectives. \u201cI know there\u2019s always questions about the invites, there\u2019s always questions about who is coming and who is not, but we should also talk about and focus on what the purpose of this meeting is,\u201d she said. The back-and-forth over attendance at the summit is indicative of the shifting dynamics in Western Hemisphere as some countries distance themselves from the US. Some US officials have downplayed the reluctance of some leaders to attend as attempts to appeal to their political base and have cautioned against reading into the decisions a sign of waning US influence. The administration has worked to maintain US influence in the region, including through recent high-level visits by first lady Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Former Sen. Christopher Dodd, who\u2019s serving as special adviser for the summit, traveled to South America and met with officials in Brazil, Chile and Argentina. After Dodd\u2019s visit, Brazil\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will attend the summit and plans to hold his first bilateral meetings with Biden. US-Brazil relations have been strained since former President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro\u2019s political ally, failed in his bid for reelection. The Brazilian President was one of the last world leaders to congratulate Biden after the 2020 US election and is publicly critical about US pressure to curb the rising Amazon deforestation in Brazil. He was initially skeptical of traveling to Los Angeles for the summit and has complained Biden ignored him when they encountered each other at the G20 last year. But he consented to attend when assured he wouldn\u2019t be subjected to just a photo-op. Dodd has held similar conversations with other leaders in the region, including lengthy discussions with L\u00f3pez Obrador, though hasn\u2019t yet secured the Mexican leader\u2019s commitment to attend. 4 takeaways from Biden's first presidential trip to Asia Even the attendance of countries working directly with the US government \u2013 and more specifically, Harris \u2013 remains in question. The leaders of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have also not yet committed to going to the summit next week, even though Harris has worked to cultivate relationships in the region, including attending the Honduran President\u2019s inauguration in January. Harris spoke with Honduras President Xiomara Castro last week, but the readout did not mention the summit. Other nations, including Chile and Argentina, have criticized Washington\u2019s decision to exclude certain countries. Latin American countries have been discussing attendance amongst themselves, according to a senior Guatemalan official. \u201cEach country has its own decision-making process and arguments in order to say we go, or we don\u2019t go,\u201d the senior Guatemalan official said. Guatemala is expected to send a delegation to the summit, though it\u2019s unclear whether the President will attend. The Biden administration is preparing a declaration on migration for countries to sign on to that provides a framework for migrant protection. \u201cThis declaration is going to allow us to focus on promoting stabilization in communities that are hosting migrants, helping those communities and the migrants that they are hosting, ensuring things like access to legal documentation and public services,\u201d Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the State Department, told reporters Wednesday. Officials also expect to deliver outcomes on boosting economic growth, coordinating on pandemic recovery and combating climate change. Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro expressed optimism about the summit, even if some countries don\u2019t attend. \u201cWe can make it work. We have a day-to-day relationship with these countries, but the summit is a chance for the countries to come together and plan ahead,\u201d he told CNN. But, Castro added, countries who have yet to commit \u201cwould be missed\u2019 if they didn\u2019t attend. Yet without assurances of who will attend, it remained unclear what weight the summit\u2019s statements would hold. Traveling in Latin America last week, first lady Jill Biden \u2014 who will join her husband in Los Angeles for an opening ceremony and leaders\u2019 dinner \u2014 said she was reassured the countries she visited, including Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica, would be attending the Summit of the Americas. The first lady waved off concerns of a boycott. \u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that they\u2019ll come.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The month of May brought the first Senate primaries of the year. Ohio voted first, followed by a near weekly stream of contests that are shaping the midterm campaign for control of the chamber. At the close of the month, the general election matchups in almost half of this year\u2019s most competitive races are nearly set, with the exception of Pennsylvania, where the Republican primary has gone to a recount. Republicans only need a net gain of one seat this fall to win the Senate, and much of the intrigue about primaries has so far been on the GOP side. Former President Donald Trump endorsed in all four Senate contests that were on the ballot in May that are expected to be competitive in the fall \u2013 Ohio, where his chosen candidate won on May 3; North Carolina, where his chosen candidate won on May 17; Georgia, where his chosen candidate won on May 24, and in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate leads by roughly 900 votes. Those primaries cemented his hold on the party because of the way so many GOP candidates, even those without his endorsement, tried to appeal to him \u2013 in some cases, twisting themselves into almost unrecognizable versions of their former selves. Trump\u2019s support played differently in each state. In Ohio, it helped \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author J.D. Vance win the primary, likely blunting the biggest attack attack on him \u2013 the candidate\u2019s past criticism of Trump. The former President\u2019s backing of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania did not have as clear of an immediate impact, especially considering voters might have already associated the two celebrity Republicans together. Near the end of the race, the millions of dollars spent attacking Oz and former hedge fund executive David McCormick seemed to open a lane for conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, but she\u2019s in a distant third place behind Oz and McCormick. Trump weighed in on the North Carolina primary nearly a year ago, but his backing of US Rep. Ted Budd didn\u2019t clear the GOP field immediately. In Georgia, however, his commitment to Herschel Walker likely kept other top-name Republicans out of the race, leaving the former NFL star gliding to the GOP nomination. Democrats argue that messy and expensive GOP primaries will leave Republican nominees bruised heading into the general election. (Democrats also had a crowded primary in Pennsylvania, but it didn\u2019t attract anywhere near the level of spending or vitriol as the GOP contest.) After watching Republican candidates run to the right to try to win their party nods, Democrats are hoping to make general election matchups a contrast in candidates. But that gets harder to do if the national environment continues to work against the party. President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating was at 41%, with 59% disapproving, according to a CNN poll, conducted by SSRS from April 28-May 1. Democrats know Republicans will tie them to him, which is one reason why a number of them broke with the White House on lifting Title 42, a Trump-era public health authority that allows border authorities to turn migrants back to Mexico or their home countries. Senate contests are increasingly becoming nationalized affairs, so while candidate quality does matter (see No. 10 on this list), Democrats face a tough challenge in holding their razor-thin Senate majority, regardless of which Republicans they\u2019re facing. CNN\u2019s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip saw a few changes in May, all in Republicans\u2019 favor. But the states that held May primaries remain in the same positions for now, with uncertainty still reigning in Pennsylvania. The ranking, which will be updated in June, is based on CNN\u2019s reporting and fundraising and advertising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) Pennsylvania \u2013 a state Biden won in 2020 \u2013 has long been the seat most likely to flip, but the May 17 GOP primary hasn\u2019t yet given us an answer to what the general election matchup to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey will look like in November. Celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz, who has Trump\u2019s backing, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick finished in a near tie \u2013 with a margin close enough to trigger the state\u2019s automatic recount process. Counties need to finish recounting \u2013 which they must do using a different device than the one used in the initial tabulation \u2013 by noon on June 7 and submit their results by noon on June 8. CNN has not made a projection in the race. The winner will face Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who easily won the Democratic nomination on May 17. Oz has declared himself the \u201cpresumptive\u201d nominee, following the lead of Trump, who urged him to declare victory while counting was still underway. While Oz had tried to capitalize on the former President\u2019s support after receiving his endorsement in early April, McCormick and his allies argued that McCormick is the real conservative. \u201cI like Trump \u2026 but not his Senate pick,\u201d voters said in one McCormick ad ahead of the primary. See tense exchange in Dr. Oz's first Senate primary debate Political commentator Kathy Barnette emerged as a late electoral threat to both men, with the political arm of the Club for Growth announcing a nearly $2 million investment to boost her candidacy, as well as the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote backing her. That late surge wasn\u2019t enough, though.  Barnette trailing Oz and McCormick. The lingering question in the Keystone State is whether Trump\u2019s backing of Oz will have made a difference if he holds on to his narrow lead after the recount \u2013 and what that means for the general election. Oz\u2019s negatives were notably high compared with his opponents in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. Forty-six percent had an unfavorable view of Oz, while 27% and 12% had unfavorable views of McCormick and Barnette, respectively. Fetterman already debuted a general election message in one of his ads ahead of the primary, in which he vowed to \u201ctake on Washington,\u201d coming across as a progressive trying to run as a populist outsider. His primary opponents had trained their attacks on him in debates, especially over a 2013 incident in which he brought along his shotgun to confront someone who later turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. And the primary had been rocked in the final days by news that Fetterman had suffered a stroke, leaving him in the hospital on election night. The former Braddock mayor finished with about 59% of the vote to 26% for US Rep. Conor Lamb, who\u2019s also from western Pennsylvania, but ran as more of a moderate and highlighted his success defeating \u201cTrump Republicans\u201d in his Pittsburgh-area House seat. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock Despite enduring attacks from GOP opponents, former NFL player Herschel Walker, who has the backing of both Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, easily won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. Having won a special election runoff in January 2021, Warnock is now seeking a full six-year term. He raised an astounding $13.6 million in the first three months of the year, which follows impressive earlier quarterly hauls, and is running direct-to-camera ads on issues with bipartisan appeal such as jobs, infrastructure and health care. Meanwhile, Democrats hope that Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will generate the base turnout they desperately need in a midterm year. But Warnock is in serious jeopardy, even against a wildcard candidate like Walker, who faces a myriad of questions about his business background and allegations of threats he made against women. Much of the GOP establishment viewed Walker as a liability at the beginning of the cycle but have, publicly at least, come around, while his team has worked to keep him relatively on script. Democrats\u2019 road to Senate control ran through Georgia last cycle, but it\u2019s still challenging political terrain for them, especially in a midterm year with an unpopular Democratic President. One unknown wrinkle, however, is how the loss of Trump\u2019s endorsed candidates for other statewide offices in the Peach State\u2019s GOP primaries could shape turnout in the fall. Georgia proved that Republican voters, even committed Trump supporters, won\u2019t necessarily follow his lead at the ballot box. They chose to stick with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, despite the former President railing against him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election. But some GOP strategists are still afraid of a repeat of the January 2021 Senate runoffs, when Trump\u2019s outspoken criticism of the election system may have kept some of his voters home, allowing Democrats to pick up both of the state\u2019s Senate seats. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto The Silver State moved up two slots in May\u2019s ranking. Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto faces a tough race in a transient state that Biden won by 2 points in 2020. The President\u2019s approval rating has sunk since then, and Nevada has some of the highest gas prices in the nation, which could play into the GOP messaging that\u2019s trying to pin steep daily living costs on the party in power. Even if Cortez Masto manages to differentiate herself from generic Democrats, that effort could be overtaken by a bad national environment, especially if Republicans are able to make more inroads with Latino voters. It doesn\u2019t help that the state Democratic Party is fractured. Cortez Masto, the former chair of Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, outraised likely GOP nominee Adam Laxalt in the first quarter of the year \u2013 $4.4 million to $1.6 million. But money isn\u2019t expected to be an issue for Laxalt, a former state attorney general \u2013 he succeeded Cortez Masto in that role \u2013 and grandson of a former senator and governor, who will benefit from GOP outside spending. Democrats argue that Laxalt, who co-chaired Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign in the state, has gone too far down the election conspiracy road and that his anti-abortion positions will alienate voters. But that may not matter as much if voters decide it\u2019s time for a change in Washington. Laxalt first faces a primary on June 14. Club for Growth Action, which is backing him, is on the air attacking Army veteran Sam Brown, who\u2019s proven to be a competitive fundraiser. Laxalt is touting Trump\u2019s backing in his own recent spot. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly Holding steady in fourth position is Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election in 2020. He\u2019s one of the best-positioned Democratic incumbents when it comes to his personal story and campaign coffers. But the former astronaut has a voting record now and is running in a purple border state that only narrowly backed Biden. Kelly is trying to stake out differences from the White House \u2013 such as his opposition to lifting Title 42. But regardless of any real separation between him and Biden, messaging those nuances is an arguably tougher job than it is for Republicans to blanketly tie him to an unpopular President. Luckily for Kelly, the messy Republican primary field won\u2019t be sorted until August. So while he\u2019s facing attacks from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, he doesn\u2019t yet have a well-defined opponent. Trump has teased that an endorsement is coming. It\u2019s unlikely to be for state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who\u2019s been a target of the former President\u2019s wrath for not doing more to investigate the 2020 election. Venture capitalist Blake Masters is backed by Peter Thiel, who was also behind Trump\u2019s chosen candidate in Ohio. But Masters also has the endorsement of the Club for Growth, which may not sit well with Trump given his differences with the group over the Ohio Senate primary. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson GOP Sen. Ron Johnson finally stepped up his fundraising \u2013 he brought in about $6 million in the first three months of the year after announcing in January that he was breaking his pledge to only serve two terms. He\u2019s been running positive spots, featuring families who say their terminally ill loved ones benefited from Johnson\u2019s support for so-called Right to Try legislation. That\u2019s not why Wisconsin slides down two spots on this list. The senator remains unpopular \u2013 36% of registered voters viewed Johnson favorably while 46% viewed him unfavorably, according to a Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday. (In February, the same poll found him underwater by a slightly worse 12 points.) Half of voters in the April Marquette survey said the phrase \u201ccares about people like me\u201d did not describe Johnson. That explains why Democrats continue to believe this seat is a better pickup opportunity with Johnson running than had it been an open seat. But Biden is also unpopular in Wisconsin. After winning the state with about 49% in 2020, his approval rating has hovered at about 43%, with some 53% disapproving, since last fall. The winner of the Democratic primary in August will likely be tied to Biden, especially with inflation emerging as a top concern, according to the Marquette poll, and worries over the coronavirus (about which Johnson has said plenty of controversial things) reaching a new low. The Democratic field is still uncertain. Support for Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who has been seen as the front-runner, declined slightly among likely primary voters in the Marquette poll, while support for Milwaukee Bucks basketball team executive Alex Lasry ticked up. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson remained in the single digits. Nearly half of those likely primary voters, however, said they hadn\u2019t picked a candidate. Lasry and Godlewski are pouring their own resources into the race to go up on TV. Barnes, who raised $1.7 million in the first quarter of the year, went up with his first TV ad in mid-May. But none of the candidates has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse the way other Democrats challenging unpopular Republicans (think Sens. Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham) have in cycles past. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan New Hampshire remains at No. 6 as the Republican field \u2013 upended late last year by Gov. Chris Sununu\u2019s decision not to seek the nomination \u2013 develops. Republicans looking to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan include state Senate President Chuck Morse, former Londonderry town manager Kevin Smith and retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who unsuccessfully sought the nomination for the state\u2019s other Senate seat in 2020. And other Republicans have been throwing their hats in the ring ahead of New Hampshire\u2019s late primary in September. Hassan, a former two-term governor, is seeking a second Senate term in a state that, on paper, should be more favorable to Democrats than any other state on this list. Biden carried New Hampshire by 7 points in 2020. An unfavorable national environment, however, could hurt her reelection chances, even without an opponent of Sununu\u2019s caliber. Hassan has come out against the Biden administration\u2019s plan to lift Title 42, making her own trip to the border last month that angered several Latino leaders back home. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) One of Trump\u2019s earliest Senate primary endorsements \u2013 for US Rep. Ted Budd last June \u2013 resulted in victory here on May 17, with Budd easily dispatching former Gov. Pat McCrory and former US Rep. Mark Walker for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr. The Trump endorsement didn\u2019t clear the field for Budd, but heavy spending from the conservative Club for Growth Action helped boost him. One spot ahead of the primary featured Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson praising Budd and knocking McCrory. \u201cPat\u2019s a nice guy, but he\u2019s no conservative,\u201d Robinson says, admitting that he\u2019d voted for McCrory in the past \u201cbut not this time.\u201d McCrory and his allies touted his record on immigration and argued that Budd is \u201cweak\u201d on a host of issues. On the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who won 81% of the vote in the primary, had essentially already cleared the primary field and pivoted to the general election. \u201cLooking at Washington, I think both parties are doing the job wrong,\u201d she said in an ad ahead of the primary. Beasley had outraised all the Republicans in the first quarter of this year, but money won\u2019t be enough in a state Trump won twice, especially in a midterm year, when Democratic turnout has often waned. Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with McConnell, made ad reservations in the state ahead of the primary to help the GOP nominee. The Democratic equivalent, Senate Majority PAC, announced an ad buy defending Beasley after the primary, despite leaving North Carolina off its list of initial reservations earlier this spring. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio Democratic Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief with a compelling story, continues to outraise Republican incumbent Marco Rubio, bringing in more than $10 million during the first three months of the year to Rubio\u2019s $5.8 million. Her campaign recently announced a Hispanic outreach effort and a $3 million investment in a state bilingual coordinated campaign. But while money is important in this expensive state, it won\u2019t be enough to flip the seat. And none of the major outside groups have made ad reservations here, signaling that they view the race as less competitive. Demings already started at a disadvantage in a state where Trump expanded on his victory margin in 2020 from four years earlier, but her job would be even harder if the national mood continues to sour on Democrats this fall. She and Rubio have traded barbs on gas prices and immigration. Rubio\u2019s campaign has tried to tie Demings to Biden\u2019s decision to rescind Title 42. Demings\u2019 team recently said she does not support lifting the measure \u201cuntil there is a plan to put more boots on the ground and support our law enforcement officers at the border.\u201d Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) The first major test of Trump\u2019s endorsement in a Senate primary this year was a success for the former President.  \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author J.D. Vance, who received Trump\u2019s backing in mid-April, won the nomination on May 3 with about 32% of the vote, finishing ahead of former state treasurer Josh Mandel (24%) and state Sen. Matt Dolan (23%). Vance\u2019s public criticism of Trump from 2016 had been a treasure trove for his primary opponents and their ad-makers. The former President, though, was willing to look past that. And it paid off for Vance, who saw his support double in a Fox poll ahead of the primary. It was a topsy-turvy race, but it\u2019s likely that Vance landed on top at just the right moment for it to matter. Still, missing out on Trump\u2019s endorsement didn\u2019t stop the jockeying among some other candidates (and their allies) to tie themselves most closely to him. Club for Growth Action, for example, which had backed Mandel and is in an open spat with Trump, ran more clips of Vance\u2019s past criticism of Trump. Another Club ad featured people, some of whom said \u201cthey love Trump,\u201d questioning the former President\u2019s judgment on endorsements past and present. Only Dolan ran truly outside the Trump election conspiracy lane in the GOP primary. Interestingly, his stock had risen in polling right before the election, presaging his third-place finish ahead of candidates who had tried to tie themselves more closely to Trump, including former state party chair Jane Timken, who had the backing of retiring Sen. Rob Portman, and businessman Mike Gibbons. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan easily won his party\u2019s nomination but starts at a disadvantage in this reddening state. Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring) It\u2019s still all about Eric Greitens in Missouri \u2013 does the former governor, who resigned in disgrace in 2018, stay in the Republican race? Does he score Trump\u2019s endorsement? And does he win the GOP nod in August? Those are the series of questions that will determine whether Missouri \u2013 a red state that shouldn\u2019t otherwise be competitive \u2013 remains on this list. Concerns about Greitens deepened in March after court documents revealed that his former wife had alleged he was physically abusive toward her and his children, which he denies. Greitens is no stranger to controversy, having resigned as governor amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Many of his primary opponents have called on him to drop out. Anxious Republicans would like to see their primary field thin, fearing that such a crowded pool of candidates could end up splitting the anti-Greitens vote and handing him a victory. Some Democrats smell opportunity. Trudy Busch Valentine, a nurse and Anheuser-Busch beer heiress, jumped into the race this spring. She hasn\u2019t said how much she\u2019ll invest in her campaign, but should this race become competitive, Democrats may benefit from having a candidate with her own money to spend. But Valentine first has a primary to win \u2013 while one Democrat dropped out of the race and endorsed her, the top fundraiser, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce, doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going anywhere. This story has been updated with additional details in Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s beyond debate that the Bushes have been the most important family in Republican politics for the better part of the past four decades. In that time, they have produced two presidents and a governor who ran for president. Which is what makes the fact that the best-known scion of this famous family appears headed for a loss in a GOP primary runoff for Texas attorney general \u2013 due, at least in part, to his famous last name \u2013 all the more remarkable and telling. I\u2019m talking here about George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, nephew of former President George W. Bush and grandson of the late President George H.W. Bush. George P. Bush, who currently serves as the the Texas land commissioner, is taking on controversial Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Back in March, Paxton took 43% of the vote to 23% for Bush in the first round of the primary, forcing a two-plus month runoff for the Republican nomination. What\u2019s remarkable is that the race has, largely, revolved around the Bush name \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t been a good thing for George P. Bush. As the Texas Tribune wrote earlier this month of his candidacy: \u201cHis ubiquitous name recognition is emerging as a liability in the Republican [P]arty.  \u2026 Some of the top reasons Republican voters are reluctant about him are his ties to his family\u2019s center-right political leanings and his own past policy positions.\u201d Bush even ran ads trying to change the subject from his last name. \u201cI\u2019m George P. Bush and I\u2019m proud of my family\u2019s contributions to Texas and America. But this race isn\u2019t about my last name,\u201d he said in one ad this month. \u201cIt\u2019s about Ken Paxton\u2019s crimes.\u201d Paxton is, at present, fighting a myriad of legal issues, though he has not been convicted of any of the charges he faces and has denied wrongdoing. There\u2019s the 7-year-old securities fraud charges. The allegations of fraud and abuse of office. And the lawsuit from the Texas state bar over Paxton\u2019s suit that aimed to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It\u2019s, um, a lot. And yet, despite all of that, Paxton is widely considered the favorite to win the Republican nomination on Tuesday \u2013 and, in so doing, emerge as a clear favorite to hold the office for another four years in still-GOP-friendly Texas. Which is, at one level, remarkable. A deeply damaged incumbent running against a rising star with a famous last name in Texas politics would seem to suggest that Bush, not Paxton would be the favorite going into the runoff. That the roles are reversed speaks to how much the Republican Party has changed in recent years. See, Paxton has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump. \u201cKen is strong on Crime, Border Security, the Second Amendment, Election Integrity and, above all, our Constitution,\u201d Trump said when he backed him last year, calling Paxton a \u201ctrue Texan who will keep Texas safe.\u201d That endorsement came despite an aggressive effort by George P. Bush to secure Trump\u2019s backing or, at the very least, to keep the former President neutral in the race. In the run-up to the announcement of his candidacy last year, George P. Bush tweeted a picture of himself on a cell phone with this caption: \u201cGreat to speak with President Trump to discuss the future of Texas and how we are keeping up the fight to put America first. I appreciate the words of encouragement and support.\u201d As Scott Braddock, editor of the Texas-based Quorum Report, noted at the time, George P. Bush supporters were handing out koozies at his campaign launch event that featured an depiction of him and Trump together with a 2019 quote from the former President that read: \u201cThis is the only Bush that likes me. This is the Bush that got it right. I like him.\u201d George P. Bush endorsed Trump in the 2020 presidential race. That George P. Bush was willing to throw his own family under the bus is telling. That it doesn\u2019t appear to have worked \u2013 even against an incumbent as damaged as Paxton \u2013 is a stunning testament to how power within the GOP has been transferred. The Bushes were the first family of national Republican politics for decades. Now, their last name is a political drag \u2013 and the once-promising next generation of their family looks headed to defeat today. Update: This story has been updated with more information on the charges Paxton faces.",

            "article_content": "Primaries on Tuesday across the South could represent the clearest chance for Republican voters to break with former President Donald Trump. In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp looks poised to hand Trump his biggest ballot box rejection yet since the former President\u2019s own loss in 2020, with polls showing the incumbent Republican far ahead of former Sen. David Perdue. Trump made the Republican governor his top target of 2022. A Kemp victory would set up a rematch between the Republican governor and Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is poised to win her party\u2019s nomination. Meanwhile, in Alabama, Trump\u2019s unendorsement of Rep. Mo Books will be tested. Trump initially had backed Brooks\u2019 Senate campaign, but took back the endorsement in March when the congressman suggested it was time for Republicans to stop looking back to 2020. Alabama voters will now decide if Brooks was right. On the Democratic side, a Texas congressional runoff will test whether there is still space for anti-abortion Democrats. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a congressman whose reelection bid was complicated in January when the FBI raided his home, is once again facing Jessica Cisneros, a progressive activist who has made Cuellar\u2019s anti-abortion stance central to her campaign following the leaking earlier this month of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. Here are seven things to watch in Tuesday\u2019s elections in Georgia, Alabama, Texas, Arkansas and Minnesota: Trump turned Georgia into the centerpiece of his effort to punish Republicans who rejected his lies about widespread election fraud costing him the 2020 presidential race. He pushed Perdue \u2013 who lost his seat in the same election cycle that Trump became the first Republican presidential nominee since Bob Dole in 1996 to lose Georgia \u2013 to run in the primary. But polls show most Georgia Republicans are ignoring Trump\u2019s mission against Kemp, and that the first-term governor is poised to win easily. Republicans look to Georgia for a path beyond Trump's 2020 grievances That\u2019s in part because Perdue was a one-note candidate focused on relitigating 2020\u2019s election, while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, aside from his clash with Trump, has a record that makes him popular with GOP voters. He reopened Georgia so early in the coronavirus pandemic that even then-President Trump said it was \u201ctoo soon.\u201d He signed into law a restrictive new voting measure that placed limits on mail-in voting. He imposed a gas tax holiday. He took conservatives\u2019 side in brewing cultural battles over schools. And perhaps most importantly, Kemp \u2013 unlike Perdue \u2013 is a proven winner. He defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams in one of the nation\u2019s most hard-fought governor\u2019s races in 2018. Four years later, Republicans who watched the party lose the presidential race and both of Georgia\u2019s Senate seats in the 2020 election are focused on electability, and the winner of Tuesday\u2019s primary will once again face Abrams. \u201cI think Stacey Abrams is a great unifier. I think every Republican in Georgia will be unified after Tuesday,\u201d Kemp told reporters over the weekend. Another race will further test Republicans\u2019 eagerness to entertain Trump\u2019s grievances: Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who became a national figure after Trump pressured him in early 2021 to overturn Georgia\u2019s election results, faces several primary challengers, including Trump-backed Rep. Jody Hice. When Rep. Mo Brooks was looking to describe his campaign two days before his Republican Senate primary against Army veteran Mike Durant and former Alabama Business Council president Katie Britt, he went biblical. \u201cJust call me a modern-day Lazarus,\u201d Brooks told CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr on Sunday, using a resurrection to describe his campaign \u2013 one where Trump pulled his endorsement two months ago because Brooks argued it was time to look ahead to the 2022 and 2024 elections, and not at Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential loss. The primary in Alabama is yet another test of whether Trump\u2019s sway \u2013 or in this case, Trump\u2019s antipathy \u2013 is enough to sink a candidate. If no candidate receives over 50% of the vote in the primary, the race between Brooks, Britt and Durant will head to a runoff next month, something Brooks admitted was \u201cvery little\u201d to happen. Alabama is also host to a gubernatorial primary in which incumbent Republican Gov. Kay Ivey is fending of challenges from the right centered on her decision to use her office to push Alabamians to get vaccinated in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Like the Senate race, it is possible that Ivey will be forced into a runoff. There is less drama in Georgia\u2019s Republican Senate primary: Former football star Herschel Walker, who is backed by Trump, has a commanding lead in the polls and is all but certain to become the nominee to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in November. How Herschel Walker united the right and has Democrats plotting for a fight The clash between Warnock and Walker will be one of the nation\u2019s marquee Senate races. With control of the 50-50 Senate up for grabs, Republicans see Georgia as a prime opportunity to pick off a Democratic seat just two years after Warnock defeated Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a special election. The race sets up a clash on racial issues: Warnock is the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, and has a long record as a civil rights champion. Walker, meanwhile, has long expressed ambivalence about racial issues. For Republicans, Walker is a risky choice: Women have accused him of violent behavior. He is also a first-time candidate who largely skipped events that would have forced him to answer tough questions during the primary, so he enters the midterm spotlight largely untested. But he is also a legend in Georgia, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1982 and became one of the greatest college running backs of all time. Tuesday\u2019s primary is the first major test of the restrictive voting law that Georgia Republicans enacted in 2021. The law imposes new identification requirements for mail-in ballots and bars elections officials from sending out mail-in ballot applications to those who haven\u2019t specifically requested them; it also restricts the use of drop-boxes for those ballots. Additionally, it makes it illegal to provide food and water to people waiting in line to vote \u2013 a provision that civil rights groups said was particularly unfair to those in urban areas who face long lines. Republicans enacted the law amid Trump\u2019s lies about widespread fraud costing him the 2020 election. Trump and Republicans in Georgia and other states that implemented similar new laws were particularly focused on mail-in voting. In spite of the new law, early voting smashed Georgia\u2019s previous records, with more than 710,000 people already having cast their ballots as of Friday, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office. Still, assessing the impact of the new law \u2013 including any potential problems that arise on election day \u2013 won\u2019t be fully possible until after it\u2019s been in place for a general election. Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders looks well positioned to win the Arkansas gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, bringing her one step closer to returning to the governor\u2019s mansion she grew up in when her father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, led the state. Sanders announced her bid in January 2021 and her strength in the race \u2013 along with a Trump endorsement \u2013 largely cleared the field, forcing both Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and Arkansas Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin to end their campaigns. If Sanders wins in November \u2013 while Arkansas has a history of electing Democratic governors, including most recently Mike Beebe, Jim Guy Tucker and Bill Clinton, it has made a dramatic turn to the right in recent years \u2013 she will be the first woman to lead the state. Texans from both parties will return to the polls for a series of runoffs to decide primary contests from March 1. For Democrats, the signature race is down along the US-Mexico border in the 28th Congressional District, where incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar, the last Democrat in Washington to oppose abortion rights, is hoping to fend off progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros for a second consecutive cycle. 'This conversation has really started to dominate on politics up and down the ballot': How abortion rights has become the center of two Texas runoff races Cuellar, who led Cisneros after the first vote but fell short of a clinching majority, has been buoyed in the campaign by millions in outside spending, led by the United Democracy Project, which is funded by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Progressive groups Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party, along with a late splurge by EMILY\u2019s List, have helped keep Cisneros competitive in the money race. On the Republican side, Tuesday night could mark the end of an era. Land Commissioner George P. Bush \u2013 son of Jeb, nephew of George W. and grandson of George H.W. \u2013 is the underdog in a runoff against incumbent two-term state Attorney General Ken Paxton. Despite his myriad legal troubles, Paxton led a field of four with nearly 43% of the vote in the March primary. Bush finished second, with less than 25%. Paxton is considered a good bet to consolidate enough of the electorate \u2013 about 35% of which was split between Rep. Louie Gohmert and former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman \u2013 and win renomination. Voters along Minnesota\u2019s southern border will head to the polls on Tuesday in the 1st Congressional District\u2019s special primary election to fill seat left vacant after Rep. Jim Hagedorn died in February. Hagedorn\u2019s widow, Jennifer Carnahan, is among the candidates running in the primary. The district, which covers the entire southern border of the state, leans towards Republicans but was represented by Democrat Tim Walz, now Minnesota\u2019s governor, from 2007 to 2019. The winners of the primary will advance to the special general election on August 9. Republicans are confident they can keep the seat red in August and, eventually, in November.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. President Joe Biden\u2019s crusade against authoritarian leaders abroad is complicated, constantly, by the messiness of his democracy at home. The leader who so forcefully condemns aggressors and so completely marshals the world community against Russia notoriously failed to marshal the senators he needed to enact a lasting domestic agenda. He\u2019s bent on ensuring that the Ukrainian and Taiwanese people can choose their own leaders in free elections, but a shocking number of Republicans continue to reject his own election victory. He sputters trying to explain a teetering economy to Americans, which could cost his party control of Congress in elections later this year. The Senate is so paralyzed by the filibuster, which gives a minority the ability to squash legislation, that no elected leaders seem to be seriously talking about federal legislation to deal with some of the largest American problems: To name a few. American democracy is not uniform. The Supreme Court seems poised to remove the right of American women to obtain an abortion within limits. Some states, exercising their own form of democracy, are looking forward to outlawing women ending any unwanted pregnancy, even shortly after conception. Oklahoma legislators recently passed a bill that would ban abortion \u201cfrom conception.\u201d Who should Biden root for in this election? A key test of faith in US democracy comes on Tuesday in Georgia when the Republican governor and secretary of state who stood up to former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election results face Republican primary voters. Both Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger want to keep their jobs. For the governor\u2019s race, Trump has endorsed former US Sen. David Perdue, but Kemp appears to have momentum, drawing the former President\u2019s ire. Election deniers, as Politico points out, have so far failed to win primaries for secretary of state positions in Idaho and Nebraska. The cruel irony of these primaries. The difficulty for someone like Biden is that he might prefer the Republicans who acknowledge the legitimacy of his presidency to triumph in their primaries. It arguably sends a signal of unity, however small, in a shared truth. But it may also hurt his party\u2019s prospects in November to have Republican candidates who can appeal to voters who do not reject him outright. Abroad, Biden speaks clearly and with power. White House aides were caught off guard and immediately sought to clarify Biden\u2019s unequivocal promise to Taiwan on Monday. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, the US would get involved militarily if China invades Taiwan just as Russia has invaded Ukraine. \u201cThat\u2019s the commitment we made,\u201d Biden said during a news conference in Tokyo, standing alongside the Japanese prime minister. It\u2019s a step farther than the US has gone in helping Ukraine, which is not part of the strategic North Atlantic Treaty Organization, known as NATO. Biden has repeated this promise multiple times in recent months, which suggests he\u2019s speaking his mind, and the aides \u2013 who reiterated US respect for mainland China\u2019s government \u2013 are trying to equivocate. International relations can be hard to follow. The US appeases China by not having official diplomatic relations with the self-governing island of Taiwan, and China blocks Taiwan from being an official member of international alliances. But the US has supported Taiwan as a democracy and pledged in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to provide arms to help it defend itself. A message from Biden to China. China would face American firepower \u2013 Biden did not elaborate on how \u2013 if it invaded Taiwan. Standing up to authoritarian aggressors for democracies is turning into the main theme of Biden\u2019s presidency. He wants to show the world that the US form of government is better than the authoritarian version, where presidents change the rules to give themselves power for decades or for life and where they plot to seize land. Remaking America as the leader of democracies. Biden\u2019s greatest success as President has been to marshal most of the world against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But at home, he faces an arduous task. The New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman emerged from a recent lunch with Biden with a heavy heart. \u201cBiden didn\u2019t say it in so many words, but he didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Friedman wrote. \u201cI could hear it between the lines: He\u2019s worried that while he has reunited the West, he may not be able to reunite America.\u201d Democracy works both ways. Friedman\u2019s larger point was that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if the next US president will be such a strong backer of democracy. The evidence suggests Biden\u2019s chance to reunite America \u2013 if that opportunity ever actually existed and if America was ever actually united \u2013 may have already passed. The same democracy that gave him power could soon take some away.",

            "article_content": "Jennifer Strahan walked up and down the main street of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s hometown with a mission \u2013 to make sure as many potential voters as possible know who she is before Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary. A first-time candidate and the most formidable of Greene\u2019s five primary opponents, Strahan has the backing of the Republican Jewish Coalition PAC and the PACs of some major local and national businesses, including UPS and International Paper. VIEW PAC \u2013 the leading organization dedicated to recruiting and electing Republican women to Congress \u2013 is opposing an incumbent for the first time by endorsing Strahan against Greene. The controversial Greene is often mentioned in the same breath as other Donald Trump acolytes in the US House, such as North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who lost his primary earlier this week. But unlike in the Tar Heel state, where Republicans \u2013 including the state\u2019s junior GOP senator \u2013 mobilized against Cawthorn, Greene hasn\u2019t encountered the same level of organized opposition \u2013 or spending \u2013 against her. VIEW PAC\u2019s independent expenditure arm has been mostly alone in making small investments in mail and digital advertising. Some Republicans in Congress have been helpful to Strahan behind the scenes, but few will go public. And even many of the GOP voters whom CNN met in the 14th Congressional District who had qualms about Greene \u2013 \u201cI like her politics but not her demeanor\u201d was a frequent refrain \u2013 hadn\u2019t heard of the Republicans running against her for this northwest Georgia seat. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s a Republican in that spot, I\u2019m OK,\u201d said Lorrie Heiken, a 54-year-old self-described \u201cMAGA\u201d supporter who does not believe President Joe Biden won the 2020 election but also thinks the QAnon conspiracy theory \u2013 and Greene\u2019s promotion of it \u2013 goes too far. Greene moved to Rome last cycle to run for the 14th District when it became open, abandoning an earlier bid for a suburban Atlanta seat. Her district, which she won with 75% of the vote in 2020 after the Democrat dropped out, remains overwhelmingly Republican, albeit slightly less so after redistricting so it\u2019s unclear how that will affect the primary electorate. Greene\u2019s campaign signs are more easily spotted on the outskirts of Rome, where eclectic restaurants and shops quickly give way to Dollar Generals and open land. But even in this bustling downtown, her influence could be felt. One business owner, who had trepidatiously put a Strahan sign in her shop window, said Strahan would be more effective in Washington but requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation \u2013 specifically the fear of receiving a threatening voicemail from the congresswoman. \u201cMy stomach is churning just talking to you,\u201d the shop owner said. Greene\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for an interview. The owner of a health care consulting company, Strahan often introduces herself to voters as the mom of a son, two dogs and a tortoise. At a recent tele-town hall, she told participants the district needs someone who\u2019s not a \u201csocial media celebrity,\u201d a not-so-subtle jab at the congresswoman. Strahan\u2019s most dedicated supporters crave that contrast. \u201cOur current representative is everything the left wanted Trump to be in that she\u2019s just ineffective and loud,\u201d said 39-year-old Josh Brown of Rockmart, who recognized Strahan at a local coffee shop and stopped her to say hello. He\u2019s enthusiastic about her candidacy, calling her \u201cmature and resolved.\u201d House GOP leadership condemned Greene for speaking at a White nationalist conference in February. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that House Republicans voted to kick then-Rep. Steve King of Iowa off his committees in Congress after he made comments that were sympathetic to White supremacists. Soon after, King was defeated in a 2020 primary. But party leadership has largely tolerated Greene, with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently traveling to the US-Mexico border with her \u2013 a sign of just how closely House Republicans have embraced Trump\u2019s most loyal followers in their conference ahead of what could be another Trump White House bid in 2024. Marjorie Taylor Greene's history of dangerous conspiracy theories and comments The Democratic majority in the House, along with 11 Republicans, voted to strip Greene of her committee assignments last year after her past statements indicating support for political violence as well as anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic comments were unearthed. While Strahan says she disagrees with that decision to punish Greene, she\u2019s used the outcome to try to paint the congresswoman as an ineffective legislator. It\u2019s a position that underscores the difficult balancing act she\u2019s trying to strike between not alienating Republicans who may have voted for Greene last cycle and dislike decisions coming from Washington, while still calling for new representation in the district. As for House Republican leadership, Strahan said she\u2019s not surprised they haven\u2019t gotten involved in her race against the incumbent, despite the fact that McCarthy is backing a primary challenger to another sitting incumbent, Rep. Liz Cheney, in Wyoming. CNN has reached out to McCarthy\u2019s political team. For the leadership of VIEW PAC, taking Greene on is about more than just the 14th District \u2013 it\u2019s also about the reputation of other Republican women in the House. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that in 2020, we elected some really tremendous Republican women and the only one people talk about is the only one who has no business being in Congress,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director, Julie Conway, told CNN. Strahan is critical of many of Greene\u2019s controversial comments, including about Russia and Ukraine, saying she recognizes that \u201cRussia is the aggressor.\u201d But when it comes to conservative policy, Strahan said there\u2019s a lot of \u201coverlap\u201d with their positions. Less so when it comes to the last presidential election, though. \u201cJoe Biden is our president,\u201d Strahan said, not directly answering a question about whether she would have voted to certify the 2020 results. Advocacy groups had recently tried unsuccessfully to get Greene disqualified from the ballot for her alleged role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. Strahan praised Trump\u2019s policies \u2013 particularly the 2017 tax law \u2013 but she wouldn\u2019t commit to supporting him for the Republican nomination in 2024. \u201cIf he\u2019s our nominee, I would support him,\u201d she said twice when asked whether she\u2019d back him in a primary. Her strongest public support among elected leaders in Washington has come from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who was one of seven Republican senators, including outspoken Trump critic Mitt Romney of Utah, to vote to convict the former President at his impeachment trial after January 6. At a Capitol Hill fundraiser for Strahan last month, Cassidy framed the race as a battle for the future of the GOP \u2013 and the country. Romney\u2019s leadership PAC has also donated to Strahan\u2019s campaign. Trump held one of his final rallies of 2020 in Rome \u2013 a testament to his popularity in this part of the state. And while Greene\u2019s outspokenness seems to have turned some voters off, for her supporters, it\u2019s exactly what they like about her and Trump \u2013 reflecting a burgeoning divide over whether elected officials should work within traditional norms or blow them up. \u201cThey hate her so I like,\u201d 66-year-old Steve Walker said of Greene as he walked out of the local Crossfit gym after his Friday morning workout and headed for his pickup truck. Who are \u201cthey\u201d? \u201cPeople in charge up there,\u201d Walker said. He\u2019d already voted early for the congresswoman, a former Crossfit gym owner who\u2019s been known to frequent this location. \u201cI love her because she\u2019s bold,\u201d said 55-year-old Audrey Burch, who was playing with her grandson in a fountain downtown. \u201cMost everything she has said I agree with.\u201d And Stephanie Howard, a 56-year-old from nearby Chattooga County, said she\u2019d heard some controversial things Greene had said but it didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI like that she voices her opinion,\u201d Howard said as she loaded groceries into her SUV at an Ingles supermarket in Summerville, about 30 miles northwest of Rome. But from behind the counter at Dogwood Books, Kenneth Studdard can see across Broad Street to the popular Harvest Moon Cafe, where Greene sometimes lunches when she\u2019s back in Rome. A 56-year-old Republican, Studdard has opposed Greene, who he said \u201cmakes everything a circus,\u201d since before the 2020 election, when he backed local neurosurgeon John Cowan in the GOP primary. Sporting an orange \u201cI\u2019m a Georgia voter\u201d sticker, Studdard said he had cast his ballot earlier that day for Strahan, even if he recognizes how hard it will be to unseat an incumbent. \u201cIf you\u2019re Strahan, you\u2019re trying to do two things: Hold her under 50 (percent) and come in second,\u201d said longtime Georgia Republican strategist Chip Lake, referring to the state\u2019s runoff rule, which requires surpassing 50% of the vote to win the primary outright. Some Democrats fear a 2020 repeat as cash flows to long-shot candidates On the Democratic side, cowboy hat-wearing Army veteran Marcus Flowers has raised more than $8 million \u2013 an enviable sum for a Republican like Strahan when the primary is the best chance at unseating Greene. \u201cIf they\u2019d given Strahan all the money Flowers has, this would be a completely different conversation,\u201d Lake said. (Strahan raised $392,000 through May 4, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission, compared with $11.9 million for Greene.) Among a trio of polo-clad businessmen strolling down Broad Street during lunchtime, two had voted for Strahan in the GOP primary the day before, while one had voted in the Democratic primary. Bob Finnell, the Democratic primary voter, was an aide to Republican Sen. Mack Mattingly, who served a single term in the 1980s. Finnell isn\u2019t pleased with the direction of the GOP \u2013 or the district. He suggested, only half-jokingly, that the only way to beat Greene would be for a candidate to film a TV ad of themselves aggressively pretending to stop immigrants from crossing state lines. Neither Republican voter thought Greene would lose the primary. \u201cSlim to none\u201d was how 34-year-old Collin Doss described Strahan\u2019s chances. His father, David Doss, said he had thought the 2020 primary runoff between Greene and Cowan wouldn\u2019t be close. \u201cI was right,\u201d he said, but he got the winner wrong: It was Greene who ended up defeating Cowan by 14 points. Still, he thinks \u2013 or hopes \u2013 this year\u2019s race against Strahan will be closer.",

            "article_content": "Republicans, reacting to the victory of Trump-backed Doug Mastriano in the GOP gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania, were uneasy about the election falsehoods he\u2019s spread about 2020 \u2013 and warned that voters aren\u2019t interested in re-litigating it. \u201cI don\u2019t think 2020 is what people are going to want to think about,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN when asked about Mastriano\u2019s claims. The fear among Republicans in the Senate is that if Mastriano implodes in the general election it could hurt their Senate candidate, according to several GOP sources. The GOP Senate primary has not yet been called. The uneasiness over Mastriano underscores the larger split within the Republican Party over former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims about the 2020 election, particularly among those who say such claims will harm the party\u2019s electoral chances in November. Senate GOP Whip John Thune also expressed concern about Mastriano\u2019s past comments, telling CNN: \u201cSome of the statements I think that that individual has made aren\u2019t ideal.\u201d And he added: \u201cBut I think people hopefully are, when it comes to the fall election, are very discerning and will be able to differentiate candidate for governor from the candidate for Senate.\u201d Other GOP senators had a similar message. \u201cIf you run across the state, you need to know the state and I think in some of these particularly battleground states, that may not be a winning message,\u201d Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said of Mastriano\u2019s stolen election claims. Tillis said Republicans should focus on economic issues and border issues \u2013 not 2020. \u201cWhy focus on things where you may evenly split or have a losing fight?\u201d Tillis said. Winners and losers from Tuesday's primaries Others were clear that Mastriano wasn\u2019t their preferred candidate. \u201cWouldn\u2019t have been my choice,\u201d said Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose retirement is creating the vacant Senate seat, told CNN he doesn\u2019t know Mastriano and didn\u2019t vote for him \u2014 and backed candidate Bill McSwain instead. But he said he would \u201csuspend judgment\u201d on Mastriano until he gets to know him and talks to him. Asked about Mastriano\u2019s false 2020 election claims, Toomey said: \u201cI\u2019m aware that he has said things that I would disagree with.\u201d Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said tying the GOP Senate candidate to Mastriano will \u201cnaturally happen,\u201d and Democrats will attempt to \u201cshow that the Republicans have put forward extreme right-wing candidates for both the governor and for the Senate and that enhances our ability to win.\u201d Toomey downplayed the impact that Mastriano would have on other GOP candidates in the state. \u201cI think they\u2019re separate races, really separate races. So I feel very good about our prospects of holding the Senate seat,\u201d he said. Others said voters need to assess the truth about 2020. \u201cI just encourage all voters to kind of look at it objectively, not just what you\u2019ve read on the internet, but what seems to be reality, make your own decision,\u201d said GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol is taking the extraordinary step of sending subpoenas to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and four other Republican lawmakers who have rejected the panel\u2019s requests to voluntarily cooperate. In addition to McCarthy, the Democrat-led panel is subpoenaing Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Lawmakers on the panel have been weighing whether to subpoena their Republican colleagues for months, wrestling with whether they had the constitutional right to do so, and debating if they wanted to set such a precedent. And with hearings less than a month away, the panel is facing a ticking clock to get all the information it can. \u201cThe Select Committee has learned that several of our colleagues have information relevant to our investigation into the attack on January 6th and the events leading up to it,\u201d the panel\u2019s chairman, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said in a statement. \u201cBefore we hold our hearings next month, we wished to provide members the opportunity to discuss these matters with the committee voluntarily.\u201d \u201cRegrettably, the individuals receiving subpoenas today have refused and we\u2019re forced to take this step to help ensure the committee uncovers facts concerning January 6th,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe urge our colleagues to comply with the law, do their patriotic duty, and cooperate with our investigation as hundreds of other witnesses have done.\u201d The committee has scheduled the depositions for the members of Congress for the end of May. CNN has reached out to the five congressmen for comment. McCarthy would not say whether he plans to comply with a subpoena to appear before the committee, saying he hadn\u2019t seen it yet, although he later clarified that his attorney had received  it. But he said he still views the committee as illegitimate. \u201cMy view on the committee has not changed,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey\u2019re not conducting a legitimate investigation. They just want to go after their political opponents,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut the one thing that has changed in America: higher inflation \u2026 unsecure border, gas prices and now we don\u2019t have baby formula.\u201d Perry would not answer when asked if he would comply with the subpoena. \u201cThis is all for headlines and sensationalism,\u201d Perry told CNN. \u201cThe fact that they sent it to the press before they send it to the members is just proof it\u2019s all about headlines. This whole thing is a charade.\u201d Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a member of the committee, said the panel weighed whether to issue subpoenas and what to do if witnesses don\u2019t comply. \u201cThis has been something to consider as we approach the end of the interview and deposition process,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe have resolved what we\u2019re going to do. So, we\u2019re moving forward. \u2026 It was more of a process of sequencing to get a good decision than it was any kind of division among members.\u201d In its initial letter to McCarthy in January, the panel made clear it wanted to question him about his communications with former President Donald Trump, White House staff and others in the week after the January 6 attack, \u201cparticularly regarding President Trump\u2019s state of mind at that time.\u201d The committee also wanted to understand how McCarthy\u2019s public comments since the attack had changed from critical to in defense of Trump over time, and questioned whether Trump pressured him to change his tone when the pair met in late January 2021. January 6 committee finalizing witness list and topics ahead of high-stakes hearings in June Since the panel\u2019s letter to McCarthy, new audio revealed that in the days following the January 6 insurrection, the minority leader had considered asking Trump to resign. Audio has also exposed that McCarthy told Republican lawmakers on a private conference call that Trump had admitted bearing some responsibility for the deadly attack. The panel first reached out to Jordan, one of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill, in December to learn more about communications he had with Trump on January 6, and with Trump allies who were stationed in the Willard Hotel war room in the days leading up to the attack. Jordan and Trump spoke on the phone in the morning of January 6, 2021, while Trump was in the White House residence, White House call records in the panel\u2019s possession, first reported by CNN, showed. Since Jordan first acknowledged that he spoke to Trump on the phone that day, the Ohio Republican and Trump loyalist has waved off questions about it or have been inconsistent in his answers. Jordan has also previously been identified as one of the lawmakers who sent a text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that the committee has in its possession. The message that Jordan forwarded to Meadows on January 5, 2021, outlined a legal theory that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to stand in the way of the certification of the 2020 election. Jordan was selected by McCarthy back in July to be one of five GOP members on the January 6 committee, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected McCarthy\u2019s selection of Jordan, along with GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, because she said their appointments could impact the \u201cintegrity of the investigation.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s decision led McCarthy to pull all five of his members, which further soured the willingness between the two parties to work together, and led Pelosi to select GOP Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to serve on the panel. Perry was the first lawmaker the committee sought voluntary cooperation from because of the key role he played in trying to help Trump undermine the 2020 election. Text messages obtained by CNN that came out after the panel\u2019s initial letter, have filled in significant gaps about the role Perry played at almost every turn in scheming to reverse or delay certification of the 2020 election. Text messages selectively provided by Meadows to the committee, show that Perry was pushing to have the nation\u2019s top intelligence official investigate baseless conspiracy theories and worked to replace the US acting attorney general with an acolyte willing to do Trump\u2019s bidding. \u201cFrom an Intel friend: DNI needs to task NSA to immediately seize and begin looking for international comms related to Dominion,\u201d Perry wrote to Meadows on November 12, 2020, just five days after the election was called for Joe Biden. In the text, which had not been previously reported, Perry appeared to be urging Meadows to get John Ratcliffe, then-Director of National Intelligence, to order the National Security Agency to investigate debunked claims that Dominion voting machines were hacked by China. A recent court filing also revealed how Perry played a key role in strategizing with Trump allies about throwing out electoral votes in states Trump lost. In testimony released in April, former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson told House investigators about Perry\u2019s role in White House strategy sessions. \u201cMr. Perry is one that immediately jumps to mind as me recalling him physically being there and then pushing back,\u201d Hutchinson said, describing how the Pennsylvania Republican clashed with Trump\u2019s White House counsel over whether the plan for states to submit alternate slate of electors was legally sound. A text from November 21, 2020, shows that Meadows even went through Perry in order to get in touch with local lawmakers in his state. \u201cCan you send me the number for the speaker and the leader of PA Legislature. POTUS wants to chat with them,\u201d Meadows wrote to Perry. The texts also show that Perry acted as a conduit between Meadows and Justice Department attorney Jeffrey Clark, a relatively obscure official who emerged as a central figure in Trump\u2019s election gambit after the former President nearly named him as acting attorney general days before the US Capitol riot. The messages draw a direct link between Perry, Clark and the Trump White House-led effort to enlist the Justice Department to help overturn the election. Last year, the Senate singled out Perry for his role in promoting Trump\u2019s election fraud conspiracies. Text messages in the panel\u2019s possession reveal that Perry texted Meadows multiple times to request the conversation move to the encrypted messaging app Signal or to alert Meadows to a message he sent on the encrypted platform. Such a move could put the exchange out of the committee\u2019s reach because Signal does not collect or save user data, making it more difficult to provide that information to outside entities, including law enforcement and congressional investigators, even under subpoena. The panel reached out to Biggs earlier this month to discuss his participation in planning meetings at the White House and remotely regarding \u201cvarious aspects of planning for January 6th.\u201d When seeking Biggs\u2019 voluntary cooperation, the committee said it wanted to understand \u201cprecisely\u201d what he knew before the violence on January 6, \u201cabout the purposes, planning, and expectations for the march on the Capitol.\u201d Biggs also was communicating with Meadows about efforts to persuade state legislators that the 2020 election was stolen, and sought their help in trying to overturn the election, according to the communications in the committee\u2019s possession. Brooks caught the committee\u2019s attention after he revealed that Trump had repeatedly asked him to work to rescind the 2020 election and remove Biden from office.

            "article_content": "A Florida circuit court judge signaled Wednesday that a new congressional map championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is likely unconstitutional, siding with Democrats and voting rights groups who said the map would illegally suppress Black voters in northern Florida. Judge J. Layne Smith, a DeSantis appointee to the 2nd Circuit Court of Florida, said during a hearing that he intended to issue an order granting an injunction that would prevent the map from going into effect. Smith said the map violates the state constitution \u201cbecause it diminishes African Americans\u2019 ability to elect the representative of their choice.\u201d The order could come as soon as Thursday. A DeSantis spokeswoman said the judge\u2019s ruling would \u201cundoubtedly\u201d be appealed. \u201cAs Judge Smith implied, these complex constitutional matters of law were always going to be decided at the appellate level. We will undoubtedly be appealing his ruling and are confident the constitutional map enacted by the Florida legislature and signed into law passes legal muster. We look forward to defending it,\u201d spokeswoman Taryn Fenske said in a statement. Pay attention to what Ron DeSantis is doing in Florida Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature pushed through the state\u2019s new congressional boundaries along party lines in a contentious April special session. The approved map, put forward by DeSantis, controversially eliminated two districts represented by Black Democrats and would given Republicans an advantage in as many as 20 of 28 districts. DeSantis contended that Florida\u2019s 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democrat Al Lawson, was unconstitutional because it stretched 150 miles to connect from Tallahassee to Jacksonville. But Smith during the hearing said the district had historical roots in Black communities along the Florida-Georgia border once populated with plantations. He added that his hands were tied by the precedent set by the state Supreme Court, which last decade set the district boundaries after years of legal battles, and the state constitution, which says a reapportionment plan cannot diminish the ability of minority residents \u201cto elect representatives of their choice.\u201d The map DeSantis signed into law decreased from four to two the number of districts where Blacks make up a plurality of voters, known as Black access districts. In addition to eliminating Lawson\u2019s seat, the state\u2019s map also shrank the percentage of Black voters in Florida\u2019s 10th Congressional District, an Orlando-area seat represented by Rep. Val Demings, a Black Democrat now running for US Senate. DeSantis\u2019 office accomplished this by shifting the district east toward Whiter communities. Florida state Rep. Kelly Skidmore, the ranking Democrat on a legislative redistricting subcommittee, said in a statement Wednesday, \u201cNo matter how they repeatedly tried to justify themselves, it should come as no surprise to the Governor and this Republican-led legislature that the map is a violation of Florida\u2019s Fair Districts amendments and the U.S. constitution.\u201d As Florida targets Disney, some Republicans chafe at DeSantis' 'vengeful' and 'punitive' Reedy Creek move Earlier this year, Florida lawmakers approved a different map and a backup in case a court found the first one unconstitutional. However, DeSantis vetoed it in March and later called lawmakers back into a special session to approve new congressional boundaries. The map that was approved and signed into law was drawn by DeSantis\u2019 office. Smith suggested the maps DeSantis vetoed could serve as the basis for maps used in the 2022 election. The vetoed maps included a Black access district in northern Florida. DeSantis appointed Smith to the circuit court in 2020. Smith previously served a county judge appointed in 2015 by then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who is now the state\u2019s junior US senator. Republicans currently hold a 16-11 advantage in Florida\u2019s US House delegation. The state added a 28th district following the 2020 US census. This headline and story have been updated.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday blamed the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine for troubling economic news as he and his administration went on the defensive over mounting inflation and rising gas prices. The President\u2019s speech at the White House was advertised by his advisers as being focused on his plan to fight inflation. While Biden did speak about inflation, he spent a significant amount of time attacking Republicans for a plan put out by the head of the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm rather than laying out any new proposals to combat the worst inflation the country has seen in 40 years. Biden said combating inflation is his top domestic priority and acknowledged \u201cfamilies all across America are hurting.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re frustrated. I don\u2019t blame them. I really don\u2019t blame them. There\u2019s a lot we have to do,\u201d Biden said. When asked by CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond if his administration bears some responsibility for the rising prices, the President said, \u201cI think our policies help, not hurt.\u201d During his speech, the President pointed to several steps his administration has already taken to bring down gas prices, including directing the release of one million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and enacting emergency measures to expand biofuel sales during the summer. He also cited his proposals to raise taxes on billionaires and other super-wealthy Americans and lower prescription drug prices for millions of Americans by letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, saying those ideas could help bring down inflation. However, many of those proposals face a dead-end in Congress, and the President expressed frustration that Democrats don\u2019t have the 60 votes needed in the Senate to pass the kind of legislation he\u2019s proposed. The Senate is currently split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats. \u201cWe control all three branches of government \u2013 well, we don\u2019t really,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u2019s speech comes at a moment when bad economic news appears to be piling up and Democrats are getting worried about what it could portend for their chances in November\u2019s midterms. A CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed fewer than a third of Americans think the Democratic Party\u2019s economic visions aligns with their own. Gas prices have also jumped to fresh record highs, with AAA reporting on Tuesday that the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is at $4.37 \u2013 a 17-cent spike in the past week. Last week the Federal Reserve announced it was taking aggressive action to lower inflation and is raising interest rates by a half-percentage point \u2013 something it hasn\u2019t done in 22 years. The administration has repeatedly pinned the blame for rising gas and energy prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the President again on Tuesday referred to it as \u201cPutin\u2019s price hike.\u201d Biden spent much of the speech repeatedly hammering \u201cMAGA Republicans\u201d and the extreme \u201cultra-MAGA\u201d policies he says they would enact if the party wins control of Congress in the midterm elections. \u201cAmericans have a choice right now between two paths reflecting two very different sets of values,\u201d Biden says. In the past week, Biden has ramped up his rhetoric against Republican and argued the far-right has overtaken the party as he tries to sharpen the contrast between his administration\u2019s policies and what Republicans are proposing. It\u2019s a significant messaging shift for a President who campaigned on unifying the country and turning down the political temperature and comes as Democrats scramble for an effective campaign message six months out from Election Day. The President has seized on a plan put forward by Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the head of Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign committee, as a primary example that leaders on the right fit into former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d mold. Scott\u2019s plan, Biden argues, would raise taxes on working-class Americans and sunset programs like Social Security and Medicare. It includes several Trumpian proposals and even calls for completing a border wall and naming it after the former President. GOP leader Mitch McConnell has publicly rebuked the plan and wants to keep the focus on criticizing the Biden administration heading into the midterms. \u201cMy plan is to lower everyday costs for hardworking Americans. And lower the deficit by asking large corporations and the wealthiest Americans to not engage in price gouging and to pay their fair share in taxes,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe Republican plan is to increase taxes on the middle class families, let billionaires and large companies off the hook as they raise profits, raise prices and reap profits at record amounts. And it\u2019s really that simple.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments on Tuesday. CNN\u2019s Donald Judd and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick has honed in on a closing message in the final days before the May 17 Pennsylvania primary: questioning the patriotic loyalties of his main primary opponent, Mehmet Oz. In a Friday press briefing organized by McCormick\u2019s campaign, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke about Oz\u2019s \u201cconnection to the Turkish government.\u201d Citing the revelation of a photo this week that showed the American-born Oz, a dual citizen of the United States and his parents\u2019 native Turkey, casting a ballot in the 2018 Turkish presidential election, Pompeo called on Oz\u2019s campaign to \u201cexplain why he had time and energy and focus to vote in a Turkish election, but not in an American election.\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019s all innocent, maybe it\u2019s all straight up, but we and the people of Pennsylvania and the Americans who he will be representing as one of a hundred members of the United States Senate voting on important national security matters need to understand the scope and depth of his relationship with the Turkish government,\u201d Pompeo said. Dr. Oz vows to renounce Turkish citizenship if elected to Senate Oz campaign spokeswoman Brittany Yanick called the criticisms from McCormick\u2019s campaign \u201cpathetic and xenophobic.\u201d She asserted that his Turkish citizenship posed no security threat to the United States and noted that Oz \u201chas already said when elected to the Senate he would renounce his citizenship.\u201d She did not respond to questions about whether Oz voted in any US elections in 2018. The 2018 photo, posted on the Facebook page of the Turkish Consulate General in New York, shows Oz placing a paper ballot into a ballot box. The post noted that Turkish citizens registered on foreign electoral rolls were eligible to vote at the consulate. ABC News first reported the existence of the picture. In February, Oz told Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin that he had \u201cnever been politically involved in Turkey in any capacity.\u201d Yanick confirmed the photo\u2019s authenticity, telling CNN that \u201cvoting in an election is far different from being actively engaged in the political work of the Turkish government, which Dr. Oz has never been involved with.\u201d Going after a candidate\u2019s loyalty to the US may be a page out of the hard-line political playbook \u2013 the kind used by former President Donald Trump, who as a candidate in 2016 accused an American-born judge of Mexican descent of being biased against him in a then-class action case against Trump University because of the Republican\u2019s pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. But despite McCormick taking up this line of attack, Trump has found himself on the other side in the primary. He endorsed Oz last month after direct lobbying by both candidates for Trump\u2019s support. \u201cNow that (McCormick) lost President Trump\u2019s endorsement, he\u2019s resorted to sad and desperate attacks that are no different than the tropes used against Catholics and Jews,\u201d Yanick said in a statement to CNN. Fact check: Misleading claims in attack ads against Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidates Oz and McCormick The Pompeo press conference on Friday follows months of efforts by the McCormick campaign to attack Oz for his ties to Turkey. After the Oz campaign accused McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, of being cozy with China in a TV ad this winter, McCormick campaign spokeswoman Jess Szymanski shot back, \u201cHow can he claim to be America First when he has dual loyalties?\u201d And in one McCormick TV ad released last month, a man speaking directly to the camera said that Oz \u201cwas in the Turkish army for cryin\u2019 out loud.\u201d Oz\u2019s campaign has said he kept his Turkish citizenship in order to care for his ill mother, who lives there. And in a 2011 interview, long before launching his Senate campaign, Oz said that before becoming a television personality, he served in the Turkish military in order to maintain that citizenship. The Oz campaign said his service amounted to 60 days. \u201cMehmet Oz chose to serve in the Turkish army over the US army,\u201d Szymanski told CNN. \u201cThese are simple facts, not campaign attacks, and his refusal to address these legitimate issues demonstrates why Pennsylvanians can\u2019t trust him.\u201d During\u2019s Friday\u2019s news conference, Pompeo acknowledged that Oz\u2019s Turkish citizenship does not legally bar him from serving in the US Senate but said the information was still relevant for voters making up their minds. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about whether it\u2019s lawful, it\u2019s about whether he is best suited to be the next United States Senator from Pennsylvania that\u2019s been represented by a patriotic American conservative for an awfully long time,\u201d Pompeo said. McCormick and Oz are among several Republicans competing for the party nomination to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey. The major GOP candidates \u2013 who include former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, businessman Jeff Bartos and conservative commentator Kathy Barnette \u2013 have faced off in two debates in recent weeks. Pompeo\u2019s support for McCormick \u2013 a fellow West Point cadet who graduated one year behind the Kansas Republican \u2013 represents a notable break with the former President. Pompeo, who has emerged as a potential 2024 candidate, served Trump first as his CIA director and later as secretary of state. Trump headlined a rally for Oz in Western Pennsylvania on Friday night that also featured other Republicans the former President has endorsed, including Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance, who won his primary earlier this week, and US Rep. Alex Mooney, who faces a competitive GOP House primary in West Virginia on Tuesday. CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Top aides to President Joe Biden say that the publishing of a draft majority opinion on abortion rights from Justice Samuel Alito has made their jobs easier: Even if the final decision ends up backtracking from the full overturning of Roe v. Wade, there\u2019s no hiding the Supreme Court\u2019s intent. Advisers to the President who were divided about how hard to lean into talking about abortion rights as a top issue are now united. Democrats around the country are lit up. And the political response, as well as the limited executive actions, that Biden aides had been planning for months have become much easier to roll out. \u201cThe simplicity of this makes it a lot easier to mobilize and communicate,\u201d a Biden adviser told CNN, emerging from scrambled meetings in a West Wing that, like everywhere else, was caught off guard by Politico publishing Alito\u2019s draft opinion. Aides thought they\u2019d have to do the work convincing voters that any adjustment to abortion rights was, in effect, a ban on Roe. Alito\u2019s draft did that for them. \u201cNo matter what nuance they add into it,\u201d the adviser said, \u201cit\u2019s overturning Roe.\u201d Rarely in politics does a moment like this come along, in which the abstract is suddenly made very real \u2013 when incremental change is replaced by a lightning bolt that immediately zaps everything into a new reality. Biden's political and personal evolution on abortion on display after publication of draft Supreme Court opinion Biden advisers, over a dozen leading Democratic politicians and top party strategists tell CNN they doubt that this alone can redefine an election year, which seems completely soured against them. But, they say, if anything can change 2022 politics, this is it. They\u2019re hoping it spikes passion among the voters that Democrats need most: Suburban women who are many of the traditional swing voters and the younger voters and disaffected Democrats who may have barely cared about the midterms \u2013 if they knew the elections were happening at all. The harshness of Alito\u2019s language in the draft decision, coupled with the turnaround from his and other justices\u2019 confirmation hearing statements that Roe was settled precedent, also has the White House and Democrats at all levels set to argue that abortion rights are just the beginning. Biden and others will argue that everything from birth control to gay marriage is now under threat. \u201cThey are not going to stop at choice,\u201d Laphonza Butler, the Emily\u2019s List president, warned this week at the annual gala for the Democratic women\u2019s group devoted to electing pro-abortion rights women. The President\u2019s inner circle and other leading Democratic strategists had envisioned the court\u2019s decision would be a politically savvier approach to a monumental question, expecting the Republican-appointed justices to legally eviscerate abortion rights without being quite as explicit. Upholding the Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks, the Supreme Court case is about, Biden aides felt, could have come across as common sense and not quite outrageous, despite the cascade of legal consequences that could have had the same practical effect. White House aides had planned to release a number of executive actions and other moves after the Supreme Court decision, expected in June, showing that the Biden administration is taking action in defense. External allies who\u2019ve been in conversation with aides have floated potential responses that could range from the Justice Department to the US Food and Drug Administration. When the draft opinion was published Monday, the significance of what the Supreme Court seems on track to do suddenly minimized anything that Biden or other officials could come up with. \u201cHonestly,\u201d the Biden adviser said, \u201cthis is all around the margins, given what taking down Roe means.\u201d Realistically, their recourse is at the ballot box \u2013 which means convincing base voters not to give up on Democrats because there\u2019s no immediate response on Capitol Hill, as there\u2019s little appetite among recalcitrant senators in their caucus to abolish the filibuster to codify Roe. The President\u2019s own views made the preparation trickier inside the White House. Abortion rights are perhaps the most complicated issue for Biden personally, and not just because he holds his deep Catholic faith in concert with a commitment to abortion rights laws. Like many of his advisers, he came of age politically in the 1970s, \u201980s and \u201890s when Democrats largely believed that talking about their abortion rights positions was a liability and worked hard to avoid the topic. That contrasts with younger aides in the West Wing, who have been pointing to clear results in recent polling that show huge opposition to banning abortion \u2013 despite significant remaining support for restrictions like the post-15 weeks ban \u2013 and Democratic voters eager to reward politicians who stand up forcefully for abortion rights. Search histories, location data, text messages: How personal data could be used to enforce anti-abortion laws The starkness of the draft opinion ended that debate, starting from the moment White House chief of staff Ron Klain called to tell the President about it being published to when he huddled with staff the next morning. In that meeting, Biden said, according to his adviser, that he thinks Alito\u2019s logic is precisely worded to have far-reaching impact, despite language in the draft about the decision being constrained to overturning Roe. He went at points into constitutional law professor mode, marveling at going against what had seemed to be 50 years of settled law. Biden advisers expect that he\u2019ll be talking about abortion rights intensely through November, leaning on news from Republican-majority state legislatures that convene sessions following the decision to pass new restrictions, and keeping close watch on Republican officials who will keep expressing their excitement over Alito\u2019s leadership and those who may stumble into viral gaffes. Campaign officials at the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm have already built files on Republicans with every vote they ever cast to defund Planned Parenthood and scans of every handwritten questionnaire from they could find of the candidates telling advocacy groups that they support repealing Roe. College campuses will have organizing drives in the fall. \u201cYou have layers and layers of fight and focus and attention here,\u201d the Biden adviser said. The President himself will also use the decision, as he did on Wednesday morning, to amp up the argument he\u2019d already been planning on making into the fall: That the Republicans are extremists who can\u2019t be trusted with power, no matter how unpopular voters find Biden and his agenda. After months of failing to get many people around the country to care much about the January 6, 2021, insurrection, Democrats say, this could be the opening. \u201cYou had these right-wing Republicans chipping away, pushing the courts as far as they could. If it\u2019s gone, then they can do anything they want,\u201d said Roy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina and the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. \u201cIt builds on each other. You have Republicans who had tried to destroy democracy. Now you have them trying to take away women\u2019s reproductive freedom.\u201d For months, informal advisers to Vice President Kamala Harris had been urging her to make abortion rights her mission for the midterms, arguing that this could provide her with the footing that she and her inner circle struggled to find over her first year in office. Abortion rights, she was told, is an ongoing fight and one extremely popular with the Democratic base \u2013 much different from politically losing issues in her portfolio like handling migration diplomacy with Northern Triangle countries, which allowed Republicans to turn her into the point person on the border crisis, and taking on the White House\u2019s false start on a big voting rights push last year. Leading the charge against any abortion decision, she was advised from the outside, could help her connect with voters that the party needs now and that she would need for an expected future presidential run of her own, several people familiar with operations in her office told CNN. On Tuesday morning, the written statement about the draft decision Harris\u2019 office released had been watered down from an original version. But by Tuesday evening, Harris herself rewrote the text of a speech she\u2019d by happenstance been scheduled months ago to give at the gala for Emily\u2019s List. \u201cThose Republican leaders who are trying to weaponize the law,\u201d she said. \u201cHow dare they? How dare they tell a woman what she can do and not do with her own body?\u201d Harris\u2019 sharp speech recalled some of her more popular breakthrough moments on the campaign trail, rather than the middling mush for which she has often been mocked. \u201cWhat folks are looking for is a fierce advocate and a vocal advocate at the highest level of government that this is something we have to fight for,\u201d said one person familiar with her thinking, the morning after the speech. \u201cThat\u2019s who they know her to be.\u201d An issue rooted in women\u2019s rights and a legal fight would seem a natural fit for a former district attorney and attorney general who is now the highest-ranking woman in American history, and who notably hosted the first-ever White House meeting with abortion providers last September. In her Emily\u2019s List speech on Tuesday night, she even referenced one of her breakout moments \u2013 questioning Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, complete with a mocking imitation of him stammering in response. \u201cIt\u2019s an historic moment and she is right to speak up. The first woman VP should be out front leading this fight,\u201d a former adviser said after the Emily\u2019s List speech, hopeful that this moment could help fuel a reboot. Standing in the way of that plan for the moment is Harris herself. Reflecting bigger issues that the vice president has been running into within the administration, Harris and aides are wary of outshining, or even being interpreted as trying to outshine, Biden. She doesn\u2019t want to get stuck again being the public face of a fight she has no actual policy authority over, which to her translates as being set up to fail. More than any of that, though, is Harris\u2019 reluctance to be cast as just a woman fighting on a women\u2019s issue \u2013 though at one point during her presidential campaign, she directly attacked Biden for originally supporting the Hyde Amendment, which prevents government funds from being used on most abortions. She recoils at that sort of tokenism on the part of the administration, adamant in private meetings that overturning Roe should be talked about in the larger legal context of eliminating other rights that reach far beyond women. Harris supporters hope that will shift as she and her staff continue to absorb how much has shifted \u2013 if not immediately, then by the time the actual decision is issued. \u201cShe can talk about infrastructure, and she should. And sure, she can talk about vaccines and maternal health, and she should,\u201d said one person close to Harris, referencing some of the vice president\u2019s other priorities. \u201cBut you can\u2019t talk about maternal health in this moment without talking about abortion. You just sound silly.\u201d \u201cMy sense,\u201d the person said, \u201cis that they are just going to do it because they can\u2019t not.\u201d Biden\u2019s own team, meanwhile, is eager to keep the focus on him. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have a huge part in this, but I think it\u2019s important that the President\u2019s going to keep communicating on this,\u201d the Biden adviser said. \u201cThis is a whole of government effort.\u201d Meanwhile, one notable other figure from the administration is already leaping in. Answering a question on Wednesday night during an appearance at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg delivered an answer that echoed many of the themes of his 2020 presidential primary run. \u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve been alive and a lot longer than that, the general path of social and political life in America and the general path of jurisprudence in this country has been toward more freedom, more liberty and more rights,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the question that I think has now been called is, did we just live to see the high watermark of liberty and freedom and rights in this country? The moment that will be remembered as the furthest we got before things started moving the other way? Or will that wave recede and we\u2019ll get even further?\u201d The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which helps coordinate strategy and fundraising for statehouse candidates around the country, saw a spike in online donations and a 1,200% increase in traffic on its site after Politico\u2019s story posted. Similarly, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund said in a statement that their volunteer sign-ups for mobilization events increased by ten-fold starting Monday night, with major activity and fundraising online. An aide to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told CNN that fundraising emails since Monday night \u201cbroke cycle-long fundraising records within mere hours of being sent.\u201d If Roe is overturned, state legislatures will be where abortion rights are either codified or wrenched back to the point of penalizing women who receive them, raising hopes they might now be able to get Democrats to care as much about these local races as Republicans have for years. \u201cIt\u2019s a key wedge issue that\u2019s been elevated. Voters are looking to see if this is a Republican they can identify with, or is this a Republican that\u2019s a bad apple,\u201d said DLCC President Jessica Post. \u201cIt\u2019s like all of the apples have gone bad \u2013 not just the orange one.\u201d For months, gubernatorial candidates have been preparing to argue that abortion rights are central to their campaigns, particularly in states where Republicans have majorities in the legislatures. \u201cOur Democratic governor\u2019s veto pen is really the only thing we have to protect the right to choose here in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Josh Shapiro, the attorney general and Democratic nominee for governor in the state, said in a phone call with reporters the morning after the draft opinion was published. Previewing how the radical nature of the overturned precedent could play into other races, a Democratic strategist recalled a focus group in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in 2010 \u2013 a key territory in the last Republican wave year. During that group, a college-educated White woman in her late 30s or late 40s, a mother, explained that she wasn\u2019t concerned about the Republican candidate\u2019s anti-abortion rights position, despite supporting abortion rights herself. Roe has lasted almost 50 years. How unusual would it be to overturn it? It wasn\u2019t like abortion was ever actually going to be illegal, the woman told the moderator. With Biden leading the charge, Democrats are going to seize on every comment regarding abortion, big and small, that every Republican has ever made. \u201cRepublicans have been giving away the cheap and easy stuff to the base because they didn\u2019t think it would matter,\u201d said a national Democratic strategist who was in the room for that focus group. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to matter.\u201d The Biden adviser echoed that thinking, previewing how the President himself will continue talking. \u201cThis issue doesn\u2019t require gadgets and widgets and extraordinary measures,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s so significant that I think you can just be straight on it.\u201d This will be a visceral, direct campaign against Republicans, said Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the chair of the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm. Democrats will ask what Republicans propose to do if a 17-year-old girl was raped and lives in a state now without access. \u201cThere was always the backstop of Roe v. Wade,\u201d Peters said. \u201cNow this is a completely different environment.\u201d Democrats have been failing so far to make voters feel that they are doing enough to address their worries about inflation and the economy. Talking about abortion won\u2019t replace the work they know they need to do on that, Biden aides and other top Democrats said, but it will give them another argument. \u201cThis is the first time in history rights have been taken away,\u201d Peters said. And this won\u2019t be just about appealing to women, said Peters. He recalled a story \u2013 one that he first shared publicly in 2020 \u2013 about how a massive problem with his first wife\u2019s desired pregnancy forced them to seek an abortion at four months. Though Peters and his wife had wanted to have a child, their doctor had said the fetus wouldn\u2019t survive. Michigan has a 1931 law banning all abortions, which will be triggered if and when Roe is overturned. He considered what they would have done then if Roe hadn\u2019t been law. Would she have died? Would they have had to figure out how to get to another state as she was struggling? Would they have had to find their way to a backroom clinic where a doctor would have, without full medical access, performed the procedure illegally? Every abortion story, Peters argued, is bound up in questions like these. \u201cTo force people to do things that are extreme when they\u2019re under emotional distress is unconscionable,\u201d he said. Peters is a 63-year-old White man who makes a $174,000 salary as a senator. But he said the way the draft decision has affected him will inform how he and other Democrats make their case through the year. \u201cObviously, women are front and center,\u201d Peters said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a family issue.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The 2022 primary season kicked off in earnest on Tuesday, with voters in Ohio and Indiana going to the polls to choose nominees for Senate, governor and a myriad of House races. I went through the results and picked out some of the winners and losers of the night that was. They\u2019re below. * Donald Trump: There\u2019s no debate that the former President\u2019s endorsement of author J.D. Vance in the Ohio GOP Senate primary was the big moment in the race. Vance went from middle of the pack to the top of the field in the wake of the endorsement and, in his victory speech, went out of his way to thank Trump for his support. Unlike many of his endorsements of incumbents with no serious chance of losing, Trump\u2019s decision to wade into the race on behalf of Vance was a genuine political risk, as it was regarded by many national observers \u2013 yours truly included \u2013 as an early test of the former President\u2019s continued sway within the party. Test passed. Plus, J.R. Majewski, who drew press for painting a massive picture of Trump on his lawn, is leading the Republican primary for Ohio\u2019s 9th Congressional District as well. * Peter Thiel: Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and a tech billionaire, dumped $15 million into the Ohio Senate race to help elect Vance. That bodes well for Thiel\u2019s other major priority this year: the Arizona Senate race, where he has given millions to a super PAC supporting Blake Masters, a former Thiel aide. * Mike DeWine: The Ohio Republican was one of the most aggressive governors in the country in working to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic. Because we live in very strange political times, that made him a target of Trumpist conservatives. But on Tuesday, DeWine won renomination rather easily, likely the result of two decidedly Trump-y candidates splitting the votes of the former President\u2019s base in the state. (Unlike in the state\u2019s US Senate race, Trump didn\u2019t take sides in the gubernatorial primary.) * Greg Pence: You could be forgiven for thinking that the older brother of the former vice president might be in a bit of trouble in a Republican primary in 2022. After all, Trump has made very clear his disdain for Mike Pence\u2019s unwillingness to overturn the 2020 Electoral College results. But Trump is nothing if not unpredictable and endorsed the Indiana congressman late last week, saying that Greg Pence is \u201cStrong on the Border, Protects Life, Defends the Second Amendment, and Supports our brave Military and Vets.\u201d Pence won his primary easily. * Tim Ryan: The Ohio congressman cruised to the Democratic Senate nomination, saving all of his money and attacks for the general election. While Vance\u2019s celebrity may make him a bit of an asymmetric challenge in the general election, he has also has a long record of columns and public statements that should be fodder for Ryan\u2019s opposition research team. Plus, Vance\u2019s flip-floppery on Trump \u2013 he was vocally opposed to him in 2016 and has now turned into an ardent supporter \u2013 should make for some slam-dunk ads for the Democrat\u2019s campaign. * Josh Mandel: The former Ohio treasurer  started the race as a clear favorite for the Republican nomination. He ended it in a distant second to Vance. It marks Mandel\u2019s second loss for Senate in the last decade. Mandel is still in his mid-40s and has plenty of time to find another race \u2013 or races  \u2013 to run, but his rising star status within the party is now officially gone. * Self-funders: The Ohio Republican Senate field was filled with candidates spending heavily from their own wealth \u2013 and not performing terribly well.  Mike Gibbons dropped almost $17 million of his own money to win just 12% of the vote. Jane Timken spent $3.5 milion of her own cash to get 6% of the vote. And Matt Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians, contributed $10.5 million to his campaign to finish third behind Vance and Mandel. * Rob Portman: The retiring Ohio Republican senator backed Timken in the race to replace him in a clear attempt to head off the Trumpification of the GOP in the state. She wasn\u2019t even close to winning. And hours after the primary was over, Portman quickly threw his support to Vance. \u201cI believe we need a #GOP majority in the U.S. Senate as a check & balance on the Biden admin, & Ohio will be key to that effort,\u201d he tweeted.",

            "article_content": "Ohio\u2019s Republican Senate primary was the first major midterm test of former President Donald Trump\u2019s enduring influence over the Republican Party \u2013 and Trump\u2019s candidate won. J.D. Vance, the venture capitalist and \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author, emerged from a well-funded field of Republicans vying to replace retiring Sen. Rob Portman. It was the marquee contest of primaries in Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday in which incumbents and establishment-backed figures otherwise largely prevailed. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine easily bested Republicans who had criticized his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, while Democratic Rep. Shontel Brown cruised to victory in her Cleveland-area congressional district in a rematch against progressive Nina Turner. Here are six takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries: Vance was languishing in the polls and written off by several of his rivals \u2013 until Trump stepped into the race. With his mid-April endorsement, the former President delivered Vance what nearly everyone else in the race had coveted and built their campaign around trying to secure. The shift was immediate. At Vance\u2019s campaign stops, some attendees said they were persuaded by Trump. At his rivals\u2019 events, voters said they had planned to vote for someone else \u2013 but Trump\u2019s endorsement had given them pause. Vance\u2019s victory underscored the former President\u2019s role as the kingmaker in the Republican Party. Though it\u2019s not clear whether Trump will succeed in his effort to oust incumbent Republicans he believes have wronged him, Ohio\u2019s results demonstrated that in open-seat races, his endorsement might be the most important factor. The political press, Vance said at his victory party Tuesday night, \u201cwanted to write a story that this campaign would be the death of Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda. Ladies and gentlemen, it ain\u2019t the death of the \u2018America First\u2019 agenda.\u201d Vance tapped into an anti-establishment message, taking constant aim at China and slamming Democrats over border security problems that he blamed for Ohio\u2019s opioid crisis. He also copped to his biggest liability in the primary, telling Republican crowds bluntly that his past criticism of Trump had been wrong. It didn\u2019t hurt that the Republican primary was a months-long demolition derby. At an early debate, former state treasurer Josh Mandel and businessman Mike Gibbons \u2013 who at the time were jockeying for first place in the polls \u2013 nearly fist-fought. No one consistently topped 30% in the polls, and a huge portion of the primary electorate was undecided. Vance\u2019s ready-for-television personality and ease at the microphone were obvious. He had the backing of billionaire tech mogul Peter Thiel, who pumped millions of dollars into a television advertising campaign to boost Vance. And he had already won over Trump\u2019s GOP acolytes \u2013 he campaigned with Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump Jr. But all of that wasn\u2019t enough to overcome his previous critiques of the former President \u2013 until Trump himself endorsed Vance and said at a rally in Delaware County last month that he didn\u2019t mind that Vance had once \u201csaid some bad sh*t about me.\u201d \u201cI want to pick somebody that\u2019s going to win, and this man is going to win,\u201d Trump said at the rally. Rep. Tim Ryan did what was expected on Tuesday \u2013 he won the state\u2019s Democratic Senate primary. Now comes the hard part. The longtime congressman from Youngstown is the Democratic Party\u2019s last and best hope in Ohio, but his odds of winning in November are long. The state that has shifted away from the party over the last dozen years: Other than Sen. Sherrod Brown, no Democrat has won a nonjudicial statewide office in the Buckeye State since 2008, and former President Donald Trump carried the state twice. And this midterm year, Democrats face both historical and economic headwinds. Ryan looked to address these odds on Tuesday, urging his supporters to stop \u201clooking at each other and seeing a Democrat or seeing a Republican\u201d and to be open to \u201cheal,\u201d to \u201ccome together\u201d and to \u201cforgive each other\u201d for decisions that others may have made. It\u2019s a message aimed squarely at winning back voters who may have left the Democratic Party and voted for Trump. Nan Whaley, the former mayor of Dayton who won the Democratic primary for governor on Tuesday, did the same in her victory speech, specifically reaching out to voters who backed Republicans in the past. \u201cOhio isn\u2019t a red state or blue state,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a frustrated state that has been ignored by politicians from both parties for too long.\u201d The Republican establishment did flex its muscles in several key races Tuesday. Gov. Mike DeWine, a fixture of Ohio politics for four decades, easily fended off right-wing challengers, including former Rep. Jim Renacci, who were critical of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. In the Senate primary, Dolan, the state senator whose family owns Major League Baseball\u2019s Cleveland Guardians, was the only candidate who rejected Trump\u2019s lies about widespread election fraud. He was battling for second place, a much stronger than expected showing for a candidate who spent much of the campaign polling in the single digits. And he won two urban population centers, Franklin County, the home of Columbus, and Cuyahoga County, home of Cleveland. In neighboring Indiana, the other state that held its primary Tuesday, former state Sen. Erin Houchin \u2013 who was a regional GOP chairwoman and an aide to former Sen. Dan Coats \u2013 won a nine-way primary in the 9th congressional district. She stymied the comeback hopes of former US Rep. Mike Sodrel, who was backed by the House Freedom Caucus. In a rematch of their 2021 special election clash, Rep. Shontel Brown again defeated progressive favorite Nina Turner, a former state senator who rose to national prominence as a top aide and surrogate to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during his two presidential campaigns. Brown, who was endorsed by President Joe Biden and backed by big spending outside groups like the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, still faced what many believed would be a slightly more difficult road this time around, with more of Cleveland, where Turner performed well last summer, drawn into the new 11th district. But even with what appeared to be a more welcoming map and another endorsement from The Cleveland Plain Dealer, Turner again fell short \u2013 and progressives, who are hoping to boost their numbers even within what\u2019s expected to be a diminished House Democratic conference next year, missed out on a chance to grab hold of the state\u2019s most reliably blue seat. The 2022 primary calendar is set to accelerate, with contests in Nebraska and West Virginia next week. And in both states, Trump is playing a prominent role in marquee races. In Nebraska\u2019s race to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, Trump has endorsed Charles Herbster, a candidate who has faced more than a dozen sexual misconduct allegations and denied them. Trump defended Herbster at a rally on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s been badly maligned and it\u2019s a shame. That\u2019s why I came out here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt would have been easy for me to say, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna come.\u2019 I defend my people when I know they\u2019re good.\u201d The full-throated defense came just days after the Nebraska Examiner reported that seven women, including Republican state Sen. Julie Slama, had accused Herbster of groping them at political events or beauty pageants, with an additional woman accusing him of kissing her forcibly. In six cases, at least one eyewitness corroborated the women\u2019s allegations, the publication reported. Herbster has denied the allegations, calling them \u201c100% false.\u201d He filed a lawsuit Friday against Slama \u2013 who says that Herbster reached up her skirt during a Republican fundraising dinner in 2019 \u2013 and claimed to have suffered \u201cgrievous harm to his reputation\u201d from her accusation. West Virginia, meanwhile, lost a seat in the House after the 2020 census, leading to two congressmen, Reps. Alex Mooney and David McKinley, squaring off for a single seat. Trump endorsed Mooney, and conservative groups have lined up behind his campaign. McKinley, meanwhile, has establishment support \u2013 including from Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who appeared in a television ad on McKinley\u2019s behalf. CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s Election Day in Ohio and Indiana, where voters will pick their party nominees in primary races ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. While Ohio has made headlines for its Senate and gubernatorial races, there are several House primaries taking place Tuesday in the Buckeye State that are worth paying attention to. In Indiana, Sen. Todd Young is unopposed in the Republican primary and isn\u2019t expected to have much difficulty winning a second term this fall. But a couple of Republican House primaries warrant a watch. The primaries in both states are taking place under congressional lines that were redrawn in redistricting following the 2020 census. Both the Indiana and Ohio maps were drawn by Republicans. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed a number of Republican incumbents seen as strong bets for reelection in November, including Ohio Reps. Jim Jordan, Brad Wenstrup, Bill Johnson, Warren Davidson, Troy Balderson, Mike Carey, Bob Latta and Mike Turner, and Indiana Reps. Jim Banks, Jackie Walorski, Greg Pence, Victoria Spartz, Larry Bucshon and Jim Baird. Here\u2019s a look at the races we\u2019re watching Tuesday: The real action in this race won\u2019t take place until November. Longtime Rep. Steve Chabot is the default GOP nominee in his bid for a 14th term after his primary opponent dropped out last week, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. Chabot has turned back well-funded Democratic challenges in recent cycles in his Cincinnati-area district, which became more Democratic in redistricting, going from a seat that backed Trump by 3 points in 2020 to one that would have supported Joe Biden by about 9 points. The fall election is once again expected to be competitive. Cincinnati City Council member Greg Landsman is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. This district was almost completely redrawn this year, transforming from a largely rural district to one that included more of the Cleveland suburbs. Republican Rep. Bob Gibbs is not running for reelection, citing frustration with the redistricting process. Former Trump aide Max Miller is the front-runner for the GOP nomination, with support from his former boss, and has dominated the field in fundraising. Podcast host Matthew Diemer is seeking the Democratic nomination, but Democrats will likely find it hard to flip a seat that would have backed Trump by 9 points in 2020. Republicans are looking to oust the longest-serving woman in US House history, Democrat Marcy Kaptur, in this Northwest Ohio district. Kaptur, who was first elected in 1982, has seen her district shift from a safe Democratic seat that currently stretches from Toledo to Cleveland along Lake Erie to a swing district that now pushes west from Toledo to the Indiana border. The leading Republican candidates include state Rep. Craig Riedel, state Sen. Theresa Gavarone and Air Force veteran JR Majewski. Kaptur could become the longest-serving woman in congressional history, surpassing former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, if she\u2019s sworn into a 21st term next year. But she would first have to win reelection this fall in a district that Trump would have carried by 3 points in 2020. Rep. Shontel Brown and progressive challenger Nina Turner are facing off in a rematch for the Democratic nomination for a deep-blue Cleveland-area district. Biden weighed in on the race last week, throwing his support behind the incumbent. Brown, a former Cuyahoga County Council member, defeated Turner in an August special election to replace former Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge, who left to become Biden\u2019s secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Turner, a former state senator and close ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is hoping for a different result this time in a district that no longer stretches into Akron and that would have backed Biden by 58 points. The winner will be the heavy favorite in November. This Northeast Ohio district is up for grabs with Democratic incumbent Tim Ryan running for US Senate. The district changed significantly in redistricting and now includes all of Akron as well as Canton. Biden would have carried it by 3 points. Democrat Emilia Sykes, a former minority leader of the Ohio state House, is unopposed in her primary. On the GOP side, Trump has thrown his support behind attorney and conservative political commentator Madison Gesiotto Gilbert, who is also a former Miss Ohio USA. Gilbert served on Trump\u2019s 2016 and 2020 campaigns, including as co-chair of the Women for Trump coalition in 2020. Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan, who is expected to easily win his primary, is seeking a second term in his northwest Indiana district that saw only minor changes in redistricting. Republicans looking to challenge him include Air Force veteran Jennifer-Ruth Green and former LaPorte mayor and Navy veteran Blair Milo. The National Republican Congressional Committee is targeting the district, which would have backed Biden by 8 points. Republican Rep. Trey Hollingsworth\u2019s decision not to seek another term has opened up this southeast Indiana district, which now stretches to the Ohio border. It remains a safely GOP seat \u2013 which Trump would have carried by 27 points \u2013 so the winner of the Republican primary will likely be heading to Congress. GOP hopefuls include former state Sen. Erin Houchin, who ran for the seat in 2016 but lost to Hollingsworth in the primary, former US Rep. Mike Sodrel, who represented an earlier version of the district from 2005 to 2007, and Army veteran Stu Barnes-Israel, a first-time candidate who served in Afghanistan.",

            "article_content": "Democrats had been struggling to find their midterm footing amid bad polls and rising inflation \u2013 but now are rallying around an issue they hope will turn around their fortunes: Abortion. With no chance of successfully passing a bill, they are pleading with voters to send them more senators to change filibuster rules and codify a woman\u2019s abortion rights. But they face a daunting environment nonetheless. \u201cWe will vote to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Majority Leader Chuck Schumer promised on the Senate floor Tuesday despite the fact Democrats don\u2019t have the votes to pass such a law. But in the wake of the stunning Supreme Court leak that showed a majority of justices voting to overturn the landmark abortion decision, Democrats are grappling with the tenuous reality of their 50-50 Senate: a fractured majority that leaves them no options to enshrining abortion rights in law and instead gives them only the power to keep it in the spotlight ahead of the November elections. While some Democratic candidates are calling on senators to expand the Supreme Court or gut the filibuster to protect Roe vs. Wade, neither of those options stands a chance of passing in the 50-50 Senate. \u201cThe 50-50 Senate sucks,\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, lamented Tuesday, adding it was her goal to try and get more Democrats elected that would back abortion rights in the future. For now, leaders are looking to force votes on abortion rights that will put members on the record and keep the issue in the headlines. It may be the best \u2013 and only \u2013 path forward for a Democratic Party that has struggled to keep voters enthusiastic ahead of the midterms. \u201cWe are discussing this point what our next move is,\u201d said Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois. \u201cThere is no decision about expanding the court in the early stages here, but there is a discussion about floor action.\u201d What justices said to get confirmed vs. what's in the draft opinion overturning Roe But floor action will also expose long-established rifts in Democratic ranks. Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, doesn\u2019t back a law that codifies abortion rights for women. In February, he voted with Republicans against advancing the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which protects the rights of women to access abortion in the US. And both Manchin and Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema reiterated Tuesday they would not back any action to gut the filibuster for abortion or any other issue. Democrats still see a path, however, to use the Supreme Court decision to turn out their base at the polls. Democrats are hopeful it could be a swift turn of fate for a party that has been struggling to rally behind a singular and cohesive message ever since efforts to pass the President\u2019s sweeping social agenda plan faltered in December. \u201cThe simple fact is that poll after poll show that Americans do not want to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d said Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. \u201cI think it will spark outrage, anger, astonishment and a lot of votes.\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, another Democrat from Connecticut, argued that after decades of fighting to overturn Roe, Republicans may be on the losing side of the argument. \u201cRepublicans are coming to terms with the fact that their position on reproductive choice is widely out of step with the American public,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be a deeply unpopular decision. It is going to have significant ramifications for Republicans.\u201d Republicans, however, say they believe overturning Roe is still the right thing to do. \u201cI really do believe that abortion is wrong, and I think most people in America don\u2019t want to see unlimited abortion,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican. Collins calls draft Roe opinion 'completely inconsistent' with what Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said during hearings and meetings Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he didn\u2019t think the issue would be as galvanizing as Democrats believed it was. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I think when you talk to people, the big issue they are dealing with right now is inflation, crime, the border, stuff like that,\u201d Scott said. Democrats say it\u2019s not just abortion that is at stake in the upcoming election. In a series of interviews Tuesday, multiple Democrats pointed out they believed Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s draft opinion struck at the heart of privacy protections that had been enshrined in decades of precedent. \u201cIf this turns out to be the opinion of the court and it\u2019s issued, it could have a major impact on the outcome of this election,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cWhen you go to an issue as fundamental as privacy and an individual\u2019s right to privacy, control of their bodies and their ability to make their own decision and the court just basically eliminates it, it is certainly a mobilizing factor in the next election.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "J.D. Vance\u2019s bid for the Ohio Republican Senate nomination has turned into the clearest early test in this year\u2019s midterm elections of former President Donald Trump\u2019s influence over the candidates whom GOP primary voters back and the policies that animate the party. Trump plucked Vance from a pack of better-polling rivals, hoping that his endorsement of the venture capitalist, whose memoir \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d became a Netflix movie, would be enough to carry the candidate through the wide-open May 3 primary to replace retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Vance possesses a ready-for-television personality and an ease at the microphone that shines through in debates and stump speeches. He has never run for office before, so he holds none of the baggage that leading rival Josh Mandel, the former Ohio treasurer with an appetite for divisive cultural debates, carries from previous losses. Mirroring Trump, Vance frequently breaks from the business-aligned interests that have long dominated conservative politics and is eager to engage in fights over Big Tech, border security and more. Vance\u2019s liabilities \u2013 largely that he can be found on video lambasting many of the same politicians and policies he now embraces \u2013 mirror those that Trump once faced. Rivals are attempting to exploit those old remarks, including Vance\u2019s 2016 suggestion that he might vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over Trump. Some Republican officials who worked to help the former President win Ohio then say they see Trump\u2019s endorsement of Vance as a betrayal, while Democratic strategists say that if Vance advances to the general election, where he will likely face Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, they will seek to portray him as inauthentic. GOP Senate hopeful Mike Gibbons, the businessman who has largely self-funded his campaign, said Trump\u2019s decision to endorse Vance left other candidates an opening that would not have existed had the former President backed someone who had been more loyal to his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. 'It's created a bit of chaos': How Trump's involvement is shaking up the Ohio Senate race \u201cMy first choice was that he endorse me. Our second choice was that he would stay out. And our third choice was that he would endorse J.D. Vance,\u201d Gibbons said in an interview. But Vance has the one thing that might matter most to Republicans voting in next week\u2019s primary: forgiveness from Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that said some bad s\u2014 about me. He did,\u201d Trump said at a rally last week at the Delaware County Fairgrounds, north of Columbus. \u201cBut you know what? Every one of the others did also. In fact, if I went by that standard, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have ever endorsed anyone in the country.\u201d Ultimately, Trump said, \u201cI want to pick somebody that\u2019s going to win, and this man is going to win.\u201d So far, Trump\u2019s endorsement appears to have translated into a boost for Vance. A Fox News poll released Tuesday showed he had edged into the lead,  with 23% support among GOP primary voters, 5 points ahead of Mandel, who is campaigning with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the race\u2019s closing weekend. They were followed, according to the survey, by Gibbons at 13%; state Sen. Matt Dolan, the only candidate who has not embraced Trump\u2019s lies about widespread election fraud in 2020, at 11%; and former state GOP chair Jane Timken at 6%. The May primaries will test Trump's role as GOP kingmaker Still, the primary battle is fluid: A quarter of those likely to vote in the Republican primary were undecided, the poll found. Strategists expect low turnout, in part because a delay in finalizing redistricting for the state legislature means Ohio has to hold two primaries this year. And establishment-leaning Republicans backing Gov. Mike DeWine against a challenge from the right might not be inclined to follow Trump\u2019s lead. \u201cSome voters still don\u2019t know when the primary is, and it\u2019s going to confuse people,\u201d Steve Stivers, a former GOP congressman who resigned last year to lead the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview Thursday. In the closing weeks of the race, Stivers said the support from Trump offered an unquestionable boost for Vance. But he said Vance remains an unknown figure to many Ohio voters because he has not run for office before and spent years living outside the state. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t really a contender before the Trump endorsement,\u201d Stivers said. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely a new figure. A lot of people don\u2019t know him because he\u2019s not been engaged in the party politics very long.\u201d While Vance moved quickly to magnify Trump\u2019s endorsement through TV ads \u2013 a sign he is counting on the former President\u2019s loyal followers to pull him across the finish line \u2013 he barely mentioned it during a campaign stop Wednesday here in Grove City. To a lunchtime crowd of about 50 people in the central Ohio town, Vance spent far more time delivering a pointed critique of President Joe Biden than touting his support from Trump. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this country is not rocket science,\u201d Vance said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad leadership.\u201d His remarks also made clear that he believes he still must address lingering concerns about his previous criticism of Trump \u2013 which has been amplified by millions of dollars in TV ads from the Club for Growth in its quest to defeat Vance. (The Club is supporting Mandel.) \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen all these advertisements accusing me of being a \u2018Never Trumper,\u2019 Vance said, speaking to a hushed room. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I didn\u2019t like Donald Trump in 2016 \u2013 like a lot of Republicans didn\u2019t love Donald Trump in 2016. The difference between me and them is that I\u2019ve actually had the honesty to admit that I was wrong.\u201d JD Vance said in 2016 the Republican Party's three-decade strategy was antagonizing Black voters He added, \u201cAmazingly in politics, just admit you were wrong, it\u2019s that simple.\u201d The remarks drew tepid applause, but several voters said later they were pleased Vance had confronted one of the biggest questions hanging over his candidacy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t in good faith vote for him because of things he said against Trump,\u201d said Bonnie Boyd of Columbus, who came to take her own measure of Vance before voting next week. She said she was most offended by Vance\u2019s comment in 2016 that he would consider voting for Clinton over Trump. \u201cThat probably hurt the most,\u201d Boyd said. But \u201cwhen Trump endorsed him,\u201d she said, \u201cI thought I can support him now.\u201d For Trump, the Vance endorsement offers one of the biggest tests yet of his grip over the GOP base. Several Republicans who came to see Vance on Wednesday disagreed with Boyd, saying they intended to make up their own minds in the Ohio primary. \u201cI\u2019m not making my decision based on Trump\u2019s choice,\u201d said Janet Riegel of Grove City, a retired librarian who is still undecided in the race. \u201cI\u2019m basing my decision on what J.D. Vance and all of the candidates stand for.\u201d Several Republican voters and party officials across Ohio said in interviews this week that the Trump endorsement has unquestionably upended the race and given Vance a lifeline in the final stretch of campaigning. But it remained an open question whether it would be enough to deliver a victory. \u201cHe still has to show that he is his own man and can win this race,\u201d a Republican lawmaker who is neutral in the contest told CNN. \u201cBut for the others, it stung.\u201d And that, one Vance adviser said, is precisely why he is not loudly trumpeting the endorsement as he still works to introduce himself to voters \u2013 as a \u201cnew generation Republican.\u201d \u201cThis is the fight that we\u2019re having \u2013 not just are we going to beat the Democrats, but what kind of Republican are we going to send to Washington?\u201d Vance said in Grove City. \u201cThe problem that we have in Washington right now is that we have very, very many weak Republicans who are terrible at fighting back against the left.\u201d While a super PAC funded by pro-Trump tech mogul Peter Thiel boosts Vance through television ads, the candidate is fully aligning himself with Trump world and its acolytes. He has held several events in recent days with the former President\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., and plans to campaign over the primary\u2019s closing weekend with Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. The other leading Republican candidates have their own surrogates. Cruz is campaigning with Mandel, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has endorsed Gibbons. Timken hired two top Trump allies, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, as strategists, and has appeared with Lewandowski at events. Trump unleashes his temper on GOP allies over Ohio Senate primary split The most significant split is between Trump and David McIntosh, the head of the Club for Growth, which has long been one of the biggest financial players in GOP primaries and has largely supported Trump-endorsed candidates. In Ohio, the group\u2019s political arm, Club for Growth Action, is airing ads highlighting Vance\u2019s previous criticism of Trump, questioning whether Trump is fully aware of Vance\u2019s words and even tweaking the former President for his past endorsement of Mitt Romney\u2019s Senate candidacy. Furious about the ads, Trump ordered an intermediary to send McIntosh a text last week that read: \u201cGo f\u2014 yourself.\u201d Vance\u2019s most significant recent stumble has been his early comments about Ukraine, as Russia prepared to launch its invasion. \u201cI got to be honest with you, I don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine, one way or the other,\u201d Vance said on former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast in February. Days later, once the gravity of the war unfolding in Ukraine was more clear, Vance backtracked. He issued a lengthy statement, saying that Russia\u2019s war was \u201cunquestionably a tragedy, especially for the innocent people caught in the crossfire,\u201d while also opposing any US or NATO military intervention. Last week, Dolan highlighted Vance\u2019s early remarks about Ukraine in a digital video, noting that Ohio is home to 80,000 people with ties to Ukraine. There are some signs in recent days that Dolan is emerging as a serious threat to Vance. The state senator whose family owns baseball\u2019s Cleveland Guardians has largely sought to stay above the fray. Most of the attention he has received in the race has been for his rejection of Trump\u2019s lies about widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential race. But Dolan also frequently points out that, as a state lawmaker, he has helped enact policies that fit into Trump\u2019s agenda. By appealing to moderates and establishment Republicans and eschewing Trumpism, Dolan has perhaps the clearest lane in the fractured primary field. And Trump seems to recognize this. The former President in a statement this week attacked Dolan over the Guardians\u2019 decision last year to change their name from the Cleveland Indians. \u201cAnybody who changes the name of the \u201cstoried\u201d Cleveland Indians (from 1916), an original baseball franchise, to the Cleveland Guardians, is not fit to serve in the United States Senate,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cSuch is the case for Matt Dolan, who I don\u2019t know, have never met, and may be a very nice guy, but the team will always remain the Cleveland Indians to me!\u201d",

            "article_content": "Coming off a showdown with Disney and a month of headlines for waging fights over hot-button social issues, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis introduced himself to Republican primary voters in Nevada during a Wednesday campaign stop for US Senate candidate Adam Laxalt. DeSantis recounted for a packed Las Vegas bar his battles against the Biden administration and Disney and rattled off his conservative victories. He called Florida the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d \u2013 a hint at possible future fights \u2013 and said Laxalt \u201cwill represent my voice in the United States Senate.\u201d \u201cThis is our opportunity to rattle the foundations of this decaying administration in Washington,\u201d DeSantis said. The event here marks the first time DeSantis as governor has ventured outside the Sunshine State to publicly campaign for a fellow Republican, and it comes amid growing chatter about DeSantis as a 2024 presidential contender. Pay attention to what Ron DeSantis is doing in Florida Nevada Republicans, used to presidential hopefuls making excuses to visit, were eager to get an early look at DeSantis. Ninety minutes before the event, more than 100 people were waiting outside Stoney\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Country near the Las Vegas Strip to hear from the Republican governor who took on Disney, helped enact a ban on certain school instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity, and opened Florida to tourists when many Vegas casinos struggled through Covid-19 restrictions. \u201cDeSantis is the future president of the United States, so I had to see him,\u201d said Jamie Fulmer, a practice manager for a local orthopedic surgeon who had vacationed in the Jacksonville, Florida, area amid the pandemic \u201cjust to be in his state.\u201d \u201cSo if he supports Laxalt, then I figure I should give this guy a shot,\u201d she said. DeSantis is running for reelection, and his campaign, which has been reticent to engage in any discussion beyond November, declined to comment on his Nevada visit. DeSantis\u2019 allies point out that he didn\u2019t agree to leave Florida for just any candidate. Laxalt and DeSantis were bunkmates in the Navy, and they remain close friends. Only DeSantis\u2019 wife has enjoyed that kind of staying power inside the governor\u2019s notoriously tight political circle. Laxalt is running for the GOP nomination to challenge US Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. The primary is June 14. Nevertheless, DeSantis\u2019 appearance in an early state on the presidential primary calendar will do little to tamp down speculation about the Republican\u2019s 2024 ambitions. Those urging DeSantis on increasingly suggest he should enter the fray regardless of whether that puts him on a collision course with former President Donald Trump. Indeed, in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the newspaper owned by casino magnate and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson before his death last year, columnist Victor Joecks penned some words of advice for DeSantis ahead of his visit, \u201cRun, Ron, run.\u201d \u201cThere is four years of evidence that Trump\u2019s policy successes don\u2019t outweigh his personality foibles in the minds of swing voters,\u201d Joecks wrote. \u201cGo with a guy who has delivered Trump-like results but has superior message discipline and strategic thinking.\u201d DeSantis signs bill creating new Florida election police force Those results include contentious bills and actions cheered on by conservatives and drawing outrage from Democrats, including creating an election police force, banning schools and businesses from teaching about White privilege, and rejecting math textbooks for allegedly including concepts such as critical race theory. \u201cWe need to continue to find leaders that emulate that kind of courage and conviction,\u201d Laxalt said of DeSantis. DeSantis also signed into law a ban on abortion in Florida after 15 weeks. His arrival in Nevada provided new fodder for Democrats to criticize Laxalt\u2019s anti-abortion position. The Cortez Masto campaign blanketed the Review-Journal website before DeSantis arrived with digital ads tying Laxalt to Florida\u2019s new law. Democrats believe abortion politics will loom large in Nevada, where a woman\u2019s right to the procedure is enshrined in state law. \u201cAdam Laxalt has never missed an opportunity to attack women\u2019s reproductive rights, and now he\u2019s campaigning with an anti-choice governor who just signed an abortion law without exceptions for victims of rape, incest or human trafficking,\u201d Cortez Masto campaign spokesperson Sigalle Reshef said. \u201cCampaigning with Governor DeSantis is part of Laxalt\u2019s long record of working to roll back the clock on abortion rights in Nevada \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what he would do in the Senate.\u201d Like elsewhere in the country, Trump remains the most popular figure among Nevada Republicans and the heavy favorite to win the 2024 nomination if he attempts a third campaign for the White House. Robin Titus, the minority leader in the state Assembly and former co-chair of Trump\u2019s Nevada campaign, said Republicans are waiting to see what the former President decides before looking for new horses to back. But Titus said DeSantis is becoming a household name among even average Republicans. She said he had won over many supporters with his fight against pandemic-related mandates and restrictions, and they continue to follow him to see what issue he will take on next. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have a guttural reaction to Ron DeSantis like folks who reach out to me about Trump,\u201d Titus said. \u201cI was a proud Trump supporter, but I might say that to someone and there may or not be a good reaction. It seems different with DeSantis.\u201d 'It's created a bit of chaos': How Trump's involvement is shaking up the Ohio Senate race Trump has maintained his grip on the GOP, in part by playing the role of kingmaker in Republican primaries across the country. The results have been mixed, but the scramble among candidates to secure a Trump endorsement nevertheless demonstrates his perceived sway among primary voters. Though polls indicate DeSantis\u2019 clout with conservatives is growing, the Florida governor has spent little political capital sharing his new spotlight with other Republican candidates. While DeSantis participated in rallies for Trump in 2020, he didn\u2019t venture outside the state to come to the assistance of other Republicans in tight races. Similarly, his endorsement of Laxalt, who is the heavy favorite in his primary race 2,000 miles from Florida, is a rarity. DeSantis hasn\u2019t weighed in on the heated gubernatorial primary across the border in Georgia between Gov. Brian Kemp and former US Sen. David Perdue, where the Republican Governors Association and Trump are on opposing sides of an expensive fight. Nor did he cross state lines in 2021, when there was an all-hands-on-deck fight over two Republican-held US Senate seats. DeSantis\u2019 campaign declined to say if the travel to Nevada signals he may be opening up his out-of-state political schedule to boost more Republicans ahead of the midterms, or if he\u2019s simply doing a favor for an old Navy buddy. DeSantis had intended to headline a fish fry for Laxalt in Nevada last year but had to cancel because of a tropical storm. DeSantis on Wednesday acknowledged he doesn\u2019t often wade into other races, despite saying he gets requests \u201cfrom people from halfway around the country that want me to support them.\u201d But he said too many Republican politicians are unwilling to fight once they\u2019re elected. He trusted Laxalt would be different, he said, because, \u201cI knew him before I was involved in politics \u2026 before he was involved in politics.\u201d The reception DeSantis received in Las Vegas suggested more appearances would be welcomed by Republicans, as would his input in contested primaries. Callers into a local conservative radio station heaped praise on DeSantis ahead of his visit, with one mentioning Florida\u2019s new election security force as a model for the country. By 4 p.m. PT, several hundred people were already crammed into the country music hall, ordering drinks and checking out a mechanical bull. By comparison, a recent Laxalt event with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz drew about 140 people, according to local reports. Disney's self-governing district says Florida cannot dissolve it without paying off its debts Christy and Barrett Adams of Las Vegas said they had come to see Laxalt because he had support from DeSantis as well as Trump. \u201cIf these two superheroes support him, we figure we gotta listen to what he has to say,\u201d Christy Adams said. Joanna Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the RGA, told CNN, \u201cObviously, we welcome (DeSantis\u2019) support for any of our incumbent governors or nominees. But that\u2019s a question for his team and the candidates.\u201d DeSantis has built up a \u201cpretty rabid following\u201d in Nevada without making frequent visits to the state, said Jeremy Hughes, a longtime GOP strategist in the state. It\u2019s a strategy he believes is intended to \u201cleave Nevadans wanting more.\u201d \u201cWhen he does come out, it becomes a must-attend event,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want overexposure, where people say, \u2018I just saw this guy last week. Don\u2019t you have a state to run?\u2019\u201d This story has been updated with remarks from Ron DeSantis and Adam Laxalt.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s staunchest allies don\u2019t like what they heard House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy saying on tape about the ex-President and some of their GOP colleagues after the Capitol attack. But they and the former President are holding their fire \u2013  at least for now. Most members of the party\u2019s MAGA faction see little political upside to picking a distracting fight with McCarthy as Republicans remain favored to win the House in the fall, according to GOP sources familiar with their thinking, and would rather hold on to their potential leverage for an anticipated speaker\u2019s race later this year, when they\u2019re hoping to extract key concessions from McCarthy. Said one Republican source: \u201cOf course\u201d that\u2019s what they\u2019re planning to do. And in a sign of just how essential their support may be down the road, Republican leaders have worked hard to court members of their right flank \u2013 including some of the very same fringe members whom they once feared posed a danger to their colleagues after January 6, 2021. The potential concessions they may demand from leadership: plum committee assignments, promises to advance their legislative priorities and a push to prioritize their demands for investigations into the White House. And if Republicans win power but have only a narrow majority, McCarthy, the clear front-runner in the race, will have little room for error in a speaker\u2019s vote and would almost certainly be forced to wheel and deal to lock down 218 votes to become the most powerful person in the House, giving rank-and-file Republicans tremendous leverage over their leader. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of turns between now and then. \u2026 It\u2019s not even May,\u201d said freshman Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection. But at least Wednesday morning, there was minimal drama during a closed-door meeting \u2013 the first time the House GOP conference had gathered since the controversy surrounding McCarthy broke last week. Even some of the Republican lawmakers whom McCarthy was caught on tape criticizing stood up to defend him, according to sources in the room. In fact, the sharpest arrows during the meeting were aimed at House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who had been recorded saying that Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s incendiary rhetoric after January 6 was \u201cpotentially illegal.\u201d And Scalise sought to smooth things over with the Florida Republican later in the day. Republicans of all stripes emerged from the conference meeting trying to put on a united front and rallying around McCarthy, all of them eager to move past January 6. \u201cI am more concerned not about the past, but about the future,\u201d said freshman Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Florida Republican who flipped a Democratic seat. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem. (McCarthy\u2019s) going to be the next speaker,\u201d added Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican who came to Congress in 2013. And Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who chairs the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus and was deeply involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election, said that Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t have anything. So they\u2019re going to talk about January 6.\u201d For the once-powerful Freedom Caucus, its muted criticism of McCarthy reflects a desire to play the long game, should the party recapture the House this fall. Not to mention, Trump \u2013 whom they still view as their north star \u2013 publicly indicated he was unbothered by the leaked audiotapes, which included the GOP leader telling other House Republicans he planned to advise Trump to resign in the immediate wake of the insurrection. But the Freedom Caucus\u2019 ability to exert control in the speaker\u2019s race depends on the GOP\u2019s margins. If Republicans win back the House with a large majority, potentially 20 or more seats, McCarthy will have more of a cushion to lose some votes from the right. But if Republicans win with just a slim majority, he may be forced to cut a deal with those members \u2013 one of the reasons why his allies are preparing to spend record sums to build a so-called \u201cgoverning majority.\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal hours after the audio of McCarthy had leaked that he and the House minority leader maintain a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d and that he viewed the California Republican\u2019s pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago and efforts to ingratiate himself with Trump as \u201ca big compliment, frankly.\u201d Three people close to Trump said his comments to the Journal aligned with what he has said privately about McCarthy, though they added that the episode has left the former President feeling as though he has more power over the top House Republican than ever before \u2013 and they expect him to cash in with several demands if the GOP retakes the House this November and McCarthy wants Trump\u2019s support in a bid for Speaker. \u201cHe has Trump\u2019s loyalty, and Trump believes that he has an even stronger hold on McCarthy now,\u201d said one of the people close to Trump. One Trump adviser said the former President wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised by McCarthy\u2019s taped comments to his House colleagues because he understands they differ politically and pragmatically. \u201cThey just get on really well because Trump knows that Kevin is a little bit more establishment than him and McCarthy knows that Trump has a base he wants to keep in his back pocket,\u201d said the Trump adviser. The former President \u201chas had a million opportunities to throw Kevin under the bus in the last year and he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s been baited and baited and hasn\u2019t taken it. I think that speaks to the goodwill McCarthy has really focused on building since the six-week period around January 6,\u201d the adviser added. If Trump and his allies do end up having influence in the speaker\u2019s race, the items on their wish list include better representation on key committees, such as the House Intelligence Committee, as well as in leadership. They are also planning to push for a rules package that guarantees a more open and transparent process for bringing bills to the floor and voting on amendments. And some members of the Freedom Caucus have been agitating to investigate Trump\u2019s baseless claims of voter fraud and to launch impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden and his Cabinet officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Gaetz and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia have also pushed for their own select committee to investigate baseless conspiracy theories about January 6. They could seek a commitment from McCarthy to pursue some of those efforts in exchange for their speaker\u2019s vote. Behind closed doors on Wednesday, McCarthy gave a full-throated defense of his taped comments and said that the effort was part of a distracting attempt to divide them ahead of the midterms, according to several sources at the meeting. McCarthy got a standing ovation, the sources said. While the broad consensus inside the House GOP is that McCarthy has largely emerged unscathed from the latest controversy, not everyone in the House GOP was willing to brush aside the damning tapes. Gaetz, a frequent critic of leadership, called McCarthy and Scalise \u201cweak men\u201d in a statement on Tuesday evening after The New York Times reported they had privately worried that some fringe members, including Gaetz, could incite more violence after January 6. And during a testy exchange at Wednesday\u2019s conference meeting, Gaetz pressed Scalise to explain his recorded comments suggesting that Gaetz was engaging in potential illegal activity by publicly attacking Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, according to sources in the room. Scalise responded that there had been a lot of information flying around after January 6 and he had just been speculating based on what law enforcement was saying at the time, adding that he takes potential threats seriously given his own experience of being shot on a baseball field during a 2017 GOP practice for an annual charity game. Scalise later asked Gaetz for a one-on-one meeting, where he attempted to hash things out and told Gaetz he was sorry if the remarks caused him any issues. The pair\u2019s sit-down was first reported by Politico. Another member who was mentioned on one of the tapes, Greene, also spoke up during the conference-wide meeting, sources said. She called for GOP leaders to apologize and said it broke her heart to hear what they said on tape. But Greene, a freshman member who has stirred up her own share of controversies, blamed the media for twisting people\u2019s words. And Greene, who had accompanied McCarthy on a recent border trip, went on to thank him and his lawyer for trying to get her personal Twitter account reinstated after it was permanently suspended \u2013 a remarkable turn of events, given that McCarthy reportedly asked after January 6 if the Twitter accounts of some controversial Republicans could be taken away. When pressed on whether he had concerns about those comments from McCarthy, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a former Freedom Caucus chief, told CNN: \u201cHeck, yeah.\u201d He also told OAN that the reports are \u201cproblematic\u201d and created a \u201chuge trust issue\u201d for him. But even as some members privately seethed over McCarthy\u2019s remarks, the Freedom Caucus didn\u2019t even discuss the minority leader during its weekly meeting Tuesday evening, said sources in the room \u2013 a sign that the rabble-rousing group is content with tabling the issue, at least for now. \u201cWe are more united than ever before under McCarthy\u2019s leadership,\u201d said Rep. Randy Weber, a Texas Republican who\u2019s a member of the House Freedom Caucus.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden will make his first trip to Asia as president next month, visiting South Korea and Japan from May 20 to May 24, White House officials told CNN, underscoring his commitment to the region even as international attention is directed toward the crisis in Ukraine. Biden, the officials said, will hold bilateral meetings with his counterpart in each country: Korean President-elect Yoon Suk Yeol, who is set to be inaugurated on May 10, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. In Tokyo, Biden is also set to meet with the leaders of Japan, Australia and India, in a gathering of the Quad partnership that\u2019s been revitalized at his initiative. The trip is meant \u201cto further deepen ties between our governments, economies, and people,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. \u201cThis trip will advance the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s rock-solid commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific and to U.S. treaty alliances with the Republic of Korea and Japan.\u201d Looming over the trip will be a spate of weapons tests by North Korea, which have worried US officials and demonstrated the hermit kingdom\u2019s continued threats. The country\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong Un, vowed during a massive military parade this week to \u201cstrengthen and develop\u201d his nuclear forces at the \u201chighest possible\u201d speed, offering a glimpse of his ambitions for the coming months. The four-day trip to Asia comes at a critical moment in Biden\u2019s presidency, as he seeks to keep the US and its allies united against Russia\u2019s unprovoked war on Ukraine amid mounting civilian casualties and intensifying fighting. The conflict in Europe has been a consuming issue of the President\u2019s second year in office, with the US committing billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine and hitting Russia with a slew of economic sanctions. Amid Russia\u2019s attacks in Ukraine, Biden has stressed that he believes the US\u2019 alliances in the Indo-Pacific are key to upholding a \u201crules-based order\u201d across the globe. At the same time, the conflict has underscored the continued threats posed by historic foes like Russia, even as Biden works to recalibrate American foreign policy toward Asia in a bid to counter China\u2019s growing influence. Biden is the third consecutive US president to voice a desire to pivot toward the region, but the trip, coming 16 months into his presidency, is later than most presidents have visited Asia. Biden\u2019s travel has been hampered by the Covid-19 pandemic. White House aides insist they are able to focus on Asia at the same time the world is consumed by the crisis in Ukraine. And officials say they have been pleasantly surprised by the willingness of US allies in Asia, including Japan and South Korea, in joining an international sanctions regime designed to crush Russia\u2019s economy. Japan and South Korea have also diverted some of their supplies of natural gas to Europe as it works to wean itself from Russian energy imports. Biden spoke with Yoon, a conservative former prosecutor, on the phone last month after he was called the winner of the South Korean election to replace outgoing President Moon Jae In. During that call, the White House said at the time, the pair discussed, among other things, the threats posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, and other global issues like Covid-19 and climate change. North Korea, which Biden identified as his greatest foreign policy challenge early in his presidency, has resumed provocative weapons tests ahead of Yoon\u2019s inauguration. The Biden administration has sought to restart diplomacy with Pyongyang, but has received little response. Yoon, meanwhile, has vowed to harden South Korea\u2019s line against the North after Moon made attempts at cultivating diplomacy \u2013 including helping then-President Donald Trump arrange a series of summits with Kim. During Trump\u2019s final visit to Seoul as president, he made a detour to the demilitarized zone, where he shook hands with Kim and stepped over the line of demarcation into North Korea. Previous presidents have also paid visits to the highly fortified border area, but it wasn\u2019t clear whether Biden plans a similar stop. Biden has already had multiple interactions with Kishida this year after the Prime Minister assumed office last fall. More recently, both leaders attended emergency summits in Brussels, Belgium, in March, convened amid Russia\u2019s attacks in Ukraine. Earlier that month, the four Quad leaders had held a call, during which they had agreed to meet in person in Tokyo later in the year. Biden\u2019s visit to South Korea and Japan also comes as US officials are carefully watching China\u2019s actions related to the war in Ukraine. The Biden administration has repeatedly stressed that Beijing would face severe consequences if it were to help the Kremlin\u2019s efforts in Ukraine, and has sternly spoken out against Chinese efforts to help spread Russian propaganda and disinformation about the war. The Asia trip will come days after Biden hosts the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Washington on May 12 and 13. In announcing that summit, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the gathering would \u201cdemonstrate the United States\u2019 enduring commitment to ASEAN, recognizing its central role in delivering sustainable solutions to the region\u2019s most pressing challenges, and commemorate 45 years of US-ASEAN relations.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There\u2019s one golden rule in the Republican Party in the age of Donald Trump: Only those who call out extremism and violent speech in public pay a political price. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy proved he learned that lesson long ago in his reaction to the latest bombshell report Tuesday about his failure to control pro-Trump hardliners he once worried posed security \u201cjeopardy\u201d to their colleagues. Days after the January 6, 2021, insurrection, McCarthy warned in a call with GOP leaders that several far-right members of the conference could incite violence at an incendiary moment in a country that was already \u201ctoo crazy.\u201d Here's everything we've learned about January 6 in the last 72 hours (and what comes next) \u201cI do not want to look back and think we caused something or we missed something and someone got hurt. I don\u2019t want to play politics with any of that,\u201d McCarthy said in the audio of a call obtained and reported by The New York Times on Tuesday. On the tape, the minority leader is heard warning that the mob attack on the Capitol showed how people might respond to inflammatory talk with violence. But on Tuesday evening, McCarthy \u2013 who appears desperate to become speaker \u2013 shrugged off the report, telling reporters \u201cnope\u201d when asked if the new drama could hurt his hopes of becoming speaker if Republicans win back the House in November. He also told his members to ignore a previous Times report and audio clip of him telling GOP leaders in the days after January 6 that he was considering advising Trump to resign over the insurrection. \u201cDon\u2019t let things like this divide us,\u201d McCarthy said in a closed-door leadership meeting on Tuesday, two sources told CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona and Lauren Fox. McCarthy appeared secure in the knowledge that the ex-President this week publicly absolved him for those comments, which were revealed by the same two Times reporters \u2013 Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin \u2013 last week. The California Republican\u2019s decision not to do more to control extreme members also fits into his pattern of behavior from the last year of siding with the ex-President\u2019s election lies in an implicit political bargain with some of Trump\u2019s most radical supporters. Yet the tape released on Tuesday is remarkable because it shows that McCarthy and another top GOP House leader, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, knew that the storming of the Capitol by Trump\u2019s mob was wrong and could flare up again. Their instinct to cool the rhetoric of colleagues targeting fellow lawmakers telling the truth about Trump\u2019s election loss was the right thing to do. Kevin McCarthy was asked about his Trump lie. His answer was gibberish But as almost always happens in the Trump era, personal ambition and a quest for power triumphed over prudence in the GOP. McCarthy, whose speakership dreams could be a reality given the strong possibility that Republicans will win the House in November, has done little to rein in those same extremist lawmakers in the year since \u2013 even when several, like Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, were accused of incitement. McCarthy\u2019s failure to do so explains the political incentive structure of the modern Republican Party, especially in the House, where Trump is still the most influential leader. Any criticism of Trump, or the radical lawmakers who support him, could dash McCarthy\u2019s hopes of winning the speaker\u2019s gavel. The last few days have confirmed McCarthy\u2019s transformation into a standard bearer for Trumpism \u2013 despite his early criticism of the insurrection for which he initially said Trump bore some responsibility. It\u2019s a remarkable shift. Twelve years ago, McCarthy was seen as an urbane and up-and-coming prophet of a purer brand of ideological conservatism than the authoritarian populism Trump would eventually ride to power in 2016. He appeared on the cover of the book \u201cYoung Guns,\u201d which he co-authored with fellow Republicans Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor. Fact check: Kevin McCarthy keeps repeating false claim that attorney general called parents 'terrorists' for wanting to attend school board meetings Thanks to his shape shifting, McCarthy\u2019s the only one of that trio left in politics. As speaker, Ryan declined to run for reelection to the House in 2018 after a tumultuous tenure dealing with the radical Freedom Caucus. As majority leader, Cantor was sensationally defeated in a 2014 Virginia primary in an upset by a far-right Tea Party-backed opponent, whose surprise victory heralded the coming of Trump and the threat he posed to establishment Republicans. As if he needed another reminder of what may lay in store for supposed disloyalty for Trump, McCarthy can look to Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, from whom he is now estranged and in many ways helped to undermine. Cheney, one of the leaders on last year\u2019s call, paid with her job as the number three GOP leader in the House because she, unlike McCarthy, kept telling the truth about Trump\u2019s lies and incitement. The Wyoming Republican, who now serves on the House select committee probing the January 6 insurrection, is facing a primary challenge from a Trump-backed candidate. The contrasting choices and fates of McCarthy and Cheney are a commentary on the forces driving the Republican Party to ever more radical extremes and the enduring power of the once-and-possibly future President. While the latest revelations about the possible future speaker\u2019s inability to confront his members might alarm a broader electorate, his lax policing of his conference will not harm him inside the GOP. CNN Exclusive: Meadows' texts reveal new details about the key role a little-known GOP congressman played in efforts to overturn election Instead, his greatest liability lies in the fact that he once considered several pro-Trump lawmakers to be too extreme. Even if McCarthy is in Trump\u2019s good graces for now, Greene, for example, has already warned that the minority leader will have to satisfy certain conditions if he is to get her vote for the top job. And in a statement Tuesday evening, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida \u2013 whom McCarthy and Scalise warned about on the call \u2013 called them \u201cweak men, not leaders.\u201d Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, who pushed to have the nation\u2019s top intelligence official investigate baseless 2020 election conspiracy theories, according to exclusive CNN reporting on Tuesday, told CNN later that night that \u201ceverybody is accountable for what they say and do\u201d when asked about McCarthy\u2019s comments. The House Freedom Caucus chairman, who was not called out by McCarthy on the January 2021 call, wasn\u2019t pleased by his suggestion on that call that social media companies should ban some members. The idea of taking away Twitter accounts is \u201cnot something I\u2019m for,\u201d Perry said. McCarthy may be popular among many other members of the House GOP, not least because he is a prodigious fundraiser. But although it would appeal to the ex-President to have a speaker who is in his debt, Trump\u2019s support can be fickle. So pressure is rising on McCarthy to deliver a GOP win in November that would give him a majority wide enough to see off any challenges from the extreme right to his future campaign for speaker. His accommodation with those members is also an insurance policy. McCarthy, for example, traveled to the southern border with lawmakers including Greene on Monday \u2013 a sign of his attempts to woo a sector of the party he once considered dangerous. Among the first GOP reaction to the latest New York Times report was that of Scalise, who was captured on the call warning that Gaetz\u2019s attacks on fellow Republicans like Cheney might be crossing a legal line. The House Republican whip, Scalise is particularly aware of the danger posed to lawmakers from violence. He fought bravely back to health after being seriously injured in a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in 2017. McCarthy's latest genuflection to Trump paints America's possible post-midterm future He told reporters on Tuesday that he hadn\u2019t seen the latest Times report, based on the forthcoming book by Burns and Martin titled \u201cThis Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America\u2019s Future.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that the liberal media wants to keep talking about January 6, because they don\u2019t want to focus on all the crises that President Biden\u2019s created from inflation to gas prices to the border.\u201d The Louisiana lawmaker\u2019s judgment about media motivations might have been off the mark. Yet his political argument has merit \u2013 up to a point. By November, the minds of American voters may well be far from the fears and subsequent behavior of Republican leaders after the Capitol insurrection, which will by then be almost two years distant. High inflation and elevated gas prices are causing misery \u2013 a theme GOP campaign ads are pushing. Soaring costs for basic items have defied the Biden administration\u2019s off-the-mark promises that inflation would be transitory. And warnings of a possible recession will worsen a national funk that could sweep congressional Democrats out of power. That makes it even more important to examine the character of the possible future Republican majority. After all, it\u2019s now clear that McCarthy and top lieutenants feared that members of their party \u2013 who could have an outsize influence on the lives of Americans next year \u2013 were a security risk. \u201cThis is serious sh*t,\u201d McCarthy said on the January 2021 call. Either he doesn\u2019t seem to believe that anymore or his political ambitions are more important.",

            "article_content": "The farther away we get from January 6, 2021, the more we learn about the circumstances surrounding it. The past 72 hours in particular have brought a flurry of revelations related to the attack on the US Capitol, including CNN\u2019s exclusive report detailing messages among former President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle before and after the insurrection. Here\u2019s everything you need to know, and what to watch for next. CNN obtained 2,319 text messages that Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent and received between Election Day 2020 and President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration on January 20, 2021. The texts offer the most vivid picture to date of how Trump\u2019s inner circle, supporters and Republican lawmakers worked behind the scenes to try to overturn the 2020 election results and then how they reacted to the violence that effort unleashed at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The logs, which Meadows selectively provided to the House panel investigating the January 6 attack, show how the former chief of staff was at the nexus of sprawling conspiracy theories that baselessly claimed the election had been stolen. Here is a sample of some of the messages: November 22, 2020 Ginni Thomas to Mark Meadows Trying to understand the Sidney Powell distancing\u2026. Meadows to Ginni Thomas She doesn\u2019t have anything or at least she won\u2019t share it if she does Ginni Thomas to Meadows Wow! December 5, 2020 Mark Meadows to Brad Raffensperger mr Secretary. Can you call the White House switchboard at 202 757 6000. For a call. Your voicemail is full January 6, 2021 Rep. Barry Loudermilk to Mark Meadows It\u2019s really bad up here on the hill. Rep. Barry Loudermilk to Mark Meadows They have breached the Capitol. Mark Meadows to Rep. Barry Loudermilk POTUS is engaging You can read more of the messages here. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is also back in the spotlight as he seeks to contain the fallout over damning and contradictory conversations he had with other GOP lawmakers about Trump in the immediate aftermath of January 6. Here\u2019s how it played out: Asked about the contradiction during a trip to the US-Mexico border this week, McCarthy offered a rambling response: \u201cThe reporter never asked me that question. The reporter came to me the night before he released the book. And my understanding was he was saying that I asked President Trump to resign. No, I never did. And that\u2019s what I was answering.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re asking, now, did I tell my members that we\u2019re gonna ask \u2013 ask them if I told any of them that I said President Trump \u2013 the answer is no. I\u2019m glad you asked that question, but what\u2019s more important than something that happened 15 months ago on a private conversation with about four other people is what\u2019s happening here right now.\u201d McCarthy did not address the denial he had given about the reporting, which was confirmed by the audio. On Tuesday evening, audio clips obtained and reported on by the Times revealed that McCarthy also expressed concern about far-right House Republicans inciting violence against other lawmakers in the aftermath of January 6, 2021. In that audio, the California Republican repeatedly lamented the inflammatory comments made by some GOP lawmakers following the US Capitol attack \u2013 a far different posture than his public efforts to downplay Republicans\u2019 role in January 6. Beyond her text to Meadows about invoking martial law, Greene has drawn attention in recent days for the unprecedented hearings that focus on whether she should be disqualified from seeking reelection because of her role in the January 6 insurrection. Why, you might ask? There is a provision of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution that bars officeholders who take part in or assist an insurrection from ever holding office again. On the witness stand Friday, Greene repeated debunked claims that Trump won the 2020 election and even brought up false-flag conspiracy theories that the US Capitol had been attacked by rogue FBI agents or racial justice activists who \u201cdressed up as Trump supporters.\u201d Her testimony, during an extraordinary all-day hearing in Atlanta, makes Greene the first member of Congress to answer questions under oath about their activities related to January 6. And, as CNN\u2019s KFile reported, a number of since-deleted videos from Greene\u2019s social media contradict comments she made during the hearing. For instance, Greene called Anthony Aguero, who CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported had cheered on and justified the Capitol break-in, \u201ca distant friend\u201d and someone whom she had not spent much time with. But in past deleted videos, saved by CNN from Greene\u2019s time as a political activist, she spoke extensively about her ties to Aguero, repeatedly boasting he was a \u201cdear, dear,\u201d \u201cgreat, great\u201d and \u201cbest\u201d friend. Those extensive ties include: The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is planning to produce a multimedia presentation and hire a writer as part of its effort to turn its largely secretive work into a compelling narrative, multiple sources previously told CNN. The online presentation, which would include links to key video evidence, would be in addition to a traditional written report, according to a source familiar with the committee\u2019s work. The committee plans to hold a series of hearings that could begin as early as May. This story has been updated with additional information Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "On Monday, during a trip to the US-Mexico border, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was asked why he had lied about the idea of asking then-President Donald Trump to resign in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Here\u2019s how he responded: \u201cThe reporter never asked me that question. The reporter came to me the night before he released the book.

(I listened to McCarthy\u2019s answer about 15 times to try to understand what he was saying.) Not only does McCarthy\u2019s answer not make much sense, but it\u2019s also factually inaccurate. Let\u2019s go back to what we know. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Last Thursday, The New York Times reported that McCarthy had told Republican colleagues in the aftermath of January 6 that he planned to advise Trump that he should resign. Later that afternoon, McCarthy denied the report from New York Times reporters and authors of the forthcoming book \u201cThis Will Not Pass,\u201d Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin, calling it \u201ctotally false and wrong.\u201d And that evening, the Times reporters produced audio of McCarthy saying exactly what they had quoted him as saying about pushing Trump to resign. So, McCarthy is dead to rights here. There\u2019s no both sides of this debate. He said the Times report was totally wrong. They had audio of him saying that he told members of Republican leadership that he would tell Trump to resign. To the extent that McCarthy has a strategy for how to deal with this mess, it appears to be one of obfuscation. He mentions the timing of the request for comment as last minute. But why does when the question is asked impact how you answer it? New audio reveals McCarthy said Trump admitted bearing some responsibility for Capitol attack He says he misunderstood the question to be whether he had ever asked Trump to resign. But, that was clearly NOT the question. Burns and Martin reported that McCarthy had talked to Republicans about telling Trump he should resign. (Here\u2019s exactly what the Times wrote: \u201cMr. McCarthy said he would tell Mr. Trump of the impeachment resolution: \u2018I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign,\u2019 he said, according to the recording of the call, which runs just over an hour.\u201d) McCarthy also suggests he didn\u2019t discuss any of this with other members. But there is audio of him on a call with GOP leaders! Don\u2019t they count? And finally, McCarthy\u2019s attempt to say this is all old news \u2013 and not as important as what\u2019s happening at the border \u2013 sort of misses the point. We are talking about a violent insurrection at the US Capitol and the role the then-President played in it by making a series of false claims about the 2020 election. That\u2019s pretty important stuff for, you know, democracy. McCarthy, at least as of right now, appears to be skating by with Trump despite these latest revelations. But man, he\u2019s not helping himself in terms of explaining his denial with answers like the one he gave Monday.",

            "article_content": "A hearing Friday on the longshot bid to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from the ballot forced the far-right lawmaker to confront some of the incendiary rhetoric she\u2019s used in the past, even as she denied vehemently that she encouraged the violent January 6 attack on the Capitol. The activists challenging her congressional candidacy argued that her statements made her a participant of an insurrection, and thus, disqualify her from future government service. They tried to connect Greene to the plans to violently interrupt Congress\u2019 electoral vote count and to those who orchestrated the attack. But Greene denied knowledge of any scheme to disrupt the proceedings and said she didn\u2019t know key players who organized the rally that preceded the congressional breach. Greene is one of multiple Republican lawmakers who have been targeted with disqualification petitions citing a constitutional amendment barring lawmakers from serving in office if they participated in an Insurrection. The challengers have faced an uphill battle to remove Greene and other lawmakers from the ballot, and on Friday, the judge presiding over the proceedings expressed some skepticism of their tactics. But the hearing also subjected Greene to a detailed grilling about her views on the riot, and whether she had any knowledge of the plans to disrupt Congress\u2019 counting of the electoral votes. She fiercely rebuked any suggestions that violence was what she had in mind as she called for protests and objections to Congress\u2019 certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s win. Here are the takeaways from the hearing: Greene said under oath that she had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of plans to disrupt Congress\u2019 counting of the 2020 electoral votes. She made the assertion after the challengers\u2019 lawyer Andrew Celli asked whether \u2013 because of the oath of office she took as a member of Congress \u2013 she would have been obligated to stop or have arrested someone who was planning to interfere with the certification proceedings. She repeated it again later on, telling the lawyer she \u201cabsolutely\u201d did not have any prior knowledge of plans to disrupt the certification. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d she said. Asked about a Tweet on her now-suspended account promoting the plans for supporters of then-President Donald Trump to protest on Washington on the day of Congress\u2019 certification vote, she said, \u201cI was asking people to come for a peaceful march, which is what everyone is entitled to do under their First Amendment, but I was not asking them to actively engage in violence or any type of action.\u201d \u201cAll of my words never, ever mean anything for violence,\u201d she added. She later said she couldn\u2019t recall whether she spoke to anyone in government about the protests planned for January 6. Nor could she remember anyone she spoke to about attending the January 6 demonstrations, according to her testimony. Claiming that there had been \u201ctremendous amount\u201d of voter fraud, Greene confirmed that she believed that President Joe Biden had lost the election to former President Donald Trump. Federal and state authorities have debunked claims of mass fraud, yet Greene claimed Friday there were \u201cmany instances\u201d of fraud. Greene said she believed that Biden had lost the election after she had repeatedly dodged questions about social media posts she published before January 6 pushing allegations of fraud and claims that Trump was the true victor of the 2020 election. Earlier in the hearing her lawyer, James Bopp Jr., defended that the statements she made after the election as legitimate political speech. \u201cThe question of voter fraud in the 2020 election was a, is a quintessential example of political speech, legitimate political disagreements about what happened,\u201d Bopp said. She clung to conspiracy theories about the Capitol assault and actively introduced some of the most sensational claims about that day. When questioned by Celli, she said she did not know whether her FBI was behind the attack. She then name-checked a figure at the center of the fringe theories that the assault was an FBI false flag plot and said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of investigations that need to happen.\u201d She recalled, during the breach, thinking the attackers were \u201cAntifa dressed up as Trump supporters\u201d because \u201cthat was the first thing we were told.\u201d Asked whether anyone from Antifa or Black Lives Matter was arrested or charged for the Capitol assault, Greene said she didn\u2019t know, while hinting at the false political prisoner narrative that the January 6 defendants are being unjustly jailed. \u201cI know they were arrested all over the country much through 2020 and over 95% of them had their charges dropped, unlike January 6 rioters that are still in jail,\u201d she said. Greene repeatedly was asked about statements and her posts on social media using incendiary rhetoric about Democratic lawmakers and other topics. She said she couldn\u2019t recall a remarks she made, at a protest before she ran for Congress, asserting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had committed treason and that treason was \u201ca crime punishable by death.\u201d She said she did not know who liked from her account a Facebook post that referenced a \u201cbullet to the head\u201d of Pelosi, but she couldn\u2019t saying definitively it wasn\u2019t her. \u201cI am testifying: I have no idea who liked that comment.\u201d she said, when asked to make clear it wasn\u2019t her. She said she didn\u2019t recall calling for protestors to \u201cflood\u201d the Capitol as part of a 2019 demonstration in favor of funding a border wall, until the challengers played the video of her making the 2019 statement. On several occasions, she rebuffed the challengers\u2019 questions about her past statements by arguing videos of her had been clipped or had been taken out of context. \u201cThat is me speaking but my sentences are cut off. My full message is not there,\u201d she said about a video played of her talking about how \u201cif they take away your guns,\u201d one can never \u201cstop a tyrannical government.\u201d She also said that, in a January 5 interview where she called January 6 a \u201c1776 moment,\u201d she was talking about \u201cthe courage to object\u201d to the counting of the electoral votes. The video was posted to her Facebook page, but Greene said she was not the one who posted it. Faced with a blockade of \u201cI don\u2019t recalls,\u201d challengers had little luck in getting Greene to elaborate her discussions or activity before the January 6 attack. Their lawyer also griped that, because of the quick timeline of the disqualification proceedings before the coming primaries, they weren\u2019t allowed to obtain additional discovery. Their cases largely hung on the previous statements she had made that had been reported on by CNN and other outlets. Marjorie Taylor Greene wants everyone to just get over January 6 Left-wing advocacy groups -- who are working with local voters in Greene\u2019s Georgia district \u2013 are seeking to remove Greene from the ballot as part of a larger campaign to use the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment to hold accountable those lawmakers who allegedly boosted the violent disruption to Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 election. The 14th Amendment says any American official who takes an oath to uphold the Constitution is disqualified from holding any future office if they \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\u201d Her testimony did not establish that she planned for violence or coordinated with anyone who rioted on January 6. That hole in the challengers\u2019 case could significantly undermine their chances of disqualifying Greene, because they need to prove that she engaged in insurrection. Georgia administrative law Judge Charles Beaudrot, who will ultimately give a recommendation to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on the disqualification question, didn\u2019t weigh in on the substance of their arguments. But at times he knocked that tactics of the challengers\u2019 lawyers. Beaudrot sustained objections Friday lodged by Bopp to questions about Greene\u2019s state of mind when she took her oath of office on January 3, 2021. He later said that the challengers they were \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d by focusing on remarks Greene made in 2019. He was also frustrated with theatrics employed by both sides as they sparred over Bopps\u2019 objections to the challengers\u2019 questioning. \u201cThis is not theater. This is not an argument in front of the Supreme Court. This is an evidentiary hearing,\u201d Beaudrot said. During opening statements, Greene\u2019s lawyer said the effort risks \u201cirrevocable harm to the voters and to the candidate\u201d \u2013 particularly if Greene is removed from the ballot for the May primaries only for the disqualification to be reversed on appeal. It\u2019s a theme that Bopp, her lawyer, returned to during his closing, as he decried how the challengers supposedly wanted to \u201chijack and cancel words like 1776, the Declaration of Independence, Independence Day, and the American Revolution.\u201d He argued that the entire process was trampling over Greene\u2019s constitutional rights, while claiming that the state proceedings were warping the purpose of the 14th Amendment. Bopp said the challengers have abused the candidacy challenge process, which usually revolves around residency and age limits, as he called Friday\u2019s hearing a \u201cpolitical show trial.\u201d He warned that if \u201cthis line is breached \u2013 so that the political hyperbole of calling people insurrectionists turns into lawsuits brought by interest groups in order to abort our democracy, destroy the rights of voters to vote for candidates of their choice, and preclude individual members from running for reelection \u2013 our democracy your honor cannot survive that.\u201d This story and headline have been updated to reflect additional developments Friday. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen contributed reporting to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is the most popular person in the Republican Party. But Ron DeSantis is the hottest name in the GOP. And he\u2019s building buzz by beating Trump at his own game. Think about the recent headlines coming from Florida and its Republican governor. * DeSantis pushed the Republican-controlled Florida state legislature to take up a bill to rescind Disney\u2019s special status in the state after the company publicly opposed what critics call the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, which the governor signed last month. State lawmakers sent that measure, as well as another aimed at Disney, to DeSantis\u2019 desk on Thursday. * DeSantis advocated for a new GOP-friendly congressional map in Florida, which state lawmakers gave final approval on Thursday. * DeSantis suggested on Tuesday he may use the power of his office to go after the Twitter board of directors if they refuse to sell the social media giant to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. * DeSantis\u2019 administration last week rejected 41% of new math textbooks that were submitted for the next school year, citing the teaching of critical race theory as one of its reasons. That came after DeSantis urged the passage of the \u201cStop WOKE Act,\u201d which is aimed at limiting alleged liberal concepts in school curriculum. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! (The only thing DeSantis hasn\u2019t said he will use the power of the Florida government to address is Rudy Giuliani\u2019s appearance Wednesday night on \u201cThe Masked Singer.\u201d Yet.) This is a page taken directly out of Trump\u2019s political playbook. When he initially ran in 2016, Trump had a simple formula. Via Twitter, he would offer up a series of thoughts on any and every issue that popped into his mind. He did this, usually, early in the morning. He\u2019d then monitor reaction to his various tweets to see what was breaking through with the Republican base that he knew he needed to win. When one or two issues looked like winners, he would focus on them \u2013 with more tweets and mentions in campaign speeches. Take the wall that Trump pledged to build around the southern border. If you go back and look at his announcement speech, you will notice that Trump doesn\u2019t even mention the wall until the end of his remarkably rambling speech. It wasn\u2019t at the core of his campaign until audiences started reacting very positively to the mention of it in speeches. Trump, immediately sensing he had hit on something, started to put the wall front and center in his campaign. Trump had and has \u2013 whether you like him or hate him \u2013 a highly attuned ear for what got people scared or outraged. He could, within the course of a day, identify what the big story was going to be for his base and lean like crazy into it. That is exactly what DeSantis has been doing for months now. He sees what is bubbling up on Fox News and then finds a way to insert himself into the conversation. But unlike Trump in 2016, DeSantis is a sitting governor, with a compliant Republican legislature at his beck and call. All of which means DeSantis can use the power of the government in one of the largest and most influential states in the country to curry favor with the national GOP base on the issue du jour \u2013 Disney! Twitter! Wokeness! \u2013 is. Meanwhile, Trump is not only out of office \u2013 and without the platform that gives you \u2013 but also uniquely fixated on relitigating the 2020 election. Which remains an animating issue for the Republican base, but is far less current than the fights DeSantis is picking. DeSantis appears to have internalized the lessons Trump 2016 taught. And now the student has become the master \u2013 at least for now. This story has been updated with new developments.",

On Wednesday, two nonpartisan political handicappers issued new House race ratings, moving a slew of seats into more vulnerable categories for Democrats. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s approval rating remains stuck at 42 percent, and if anything the political environment has deteriorated for Democrats since January as inflation concerns have soared and Build Back Better has stalled,\u201d wrote David Wasserman, the House editor for the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. \u201cThat means no Democrat in a single-digit Biden (or Trump-won) district is secure, and even some seats Biden carried by double-digit margins in 2020 could come into play this fall, giving the GOP surprising \u2018reach\u2019 opportunities.\u201d To back up that analysis, Wasserman moved eight Democratic-held seats into more a competitive territory \u2013 including two seats held by Nevada Democrats (Reps. Susie Lee and Steven Horsford) and Virginia\u2019s Abigail Spanberger into its \u201ctoss up\u201d category. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! The Cook Political Report now has 27 Democratic-held seats in its \u201ctoss up\u201d category or worse, as compared to just 12 similarly rated seats for Republicans. (Wasserman adds that once redistricting processes conclude in New Hampshire and Florida, those numbers are likely to get worse for Democrats.) The story is the same at the University of Virginia Center for Politics\u2019 \u201cCrystal Ball,\u201d which  shifted race ratings for 11 seats on Wednesday \u2013 all in favor of Republicans. Those moves include moving four GOP-held seats from \u201clikely Republican\u201d to \u201csafe Republican,\u201d as well as moving seven Democratic-held seats into more electoral jeopardy. \u201cOur main question about the House continues to be not whether Republicans will flip the House \u2014 although we would not completely shut the door on Democrats\u2019 retaining control if the political environment improves markedly \u2014 but rather how big the Republicans\u2019 eventual majority will be,\u201d wrote UVA\u2019s Kyle Kondik. These changes come amid a political environment that looks bad \u2013 and may be getting worse \u2013 for Democrats. As Wasserman pointed out, Biden\u2019s approval ratings are hovering around the low 40s \u2013 or worse. Inflation is at a 40-year high. Gas prices remain elevated \u2013 although they have come down from highs reached late last month. And as I wrote here, Biden is facing a revolt from his own party on his administration\u2019s decision to rescind Title 42, a public health measure that has allowed border patrol agents to turn away migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The new ratings also land in a historical context that looks equally bad for Democrats. As Nathan Gonzales, who runs the nonpartisan Inside Elections tipsheet, has noted, the president\u2019s party has lost an average of 30 House seats in midterm elections over the last 100 years. Those numbers \u2013 as documented by Gallup \u2013 are even more daunting when the president is unpopular. As of 2018, the average seat loss for the president\u2019s party when his approval rating is below 50% was 37 seats. (Presidents with job approval over 50% saw their party lose an average of 14 seats in the midterm elections.) There are 202 days left before Election Day 2022. Which is, in theory, enough time for Democrats to change the trajectory of the political environment. But it\u2019s hard to see how they would go about doing that. And right now, things look pretty bleak.",

            "article_content": "Campaigning for the Senate in Ohio in recent weeks, J.D. Vance has ridiculed claims that advocates of a border-wall were \u201cracist.\u201d But in multiple appearances in 2016, he made a similar argument to the one he is currently ridiculing \u2013 including saying that Republican electoral strategy had been to antagonize Black voters and minorities for three decades. Vance was a critic of Donald Trump at the time, agreeing he was a \u201ctotal fraud\u201d who didn\u2019t care about people and used issues like \u201cthe great Mexican wall\u201d to give voters something to latch onto instead of policy solutions. Vance also told a New York City public radio host that many White working-class voters who supported Trump did not attend church regularly, making them susceptible to the sense of community in a Trump rally. At the same time, Vance argued racism did play a role in support for Trump, but not the biggest. Now, the GOP hopeful strikes a different tone, mirroring rhetoric he once said was bad for the country to become more aligned with Trump in hopes of winning over those same supporters. Trump endorsed Vance Friday. Vance released a video last week saying advocates of the border wall were falsely branded as \u201cracist\u201d for supporting building the wall and last month shared an ad from a PAC backing him that advocated for focusing on building a wall on the southern border \u2013 \u201cJD Vance will finish the wall.\u201d Vance told CNN host Don Lemon in October 2016 during a discussion on minority voters that he believed the Republican Party had been \u201cactively antagonizing\u201d Black Americans to win elections for three decades. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t speak to issues of special concern of minority voters or Black voters, it\u2019s that he seems to like actively antagonizing a lot of the Black voters,\u201d Vance told Lemon during a panel discussion. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s been the Republican Party strategy for 30 years. I say that as a Republican who wants the party to get more Black voters. And Trump seems to be taking that strategy just to the next level. It shows in the polls, right? He\u2019s not going to do especially well on Election Day.\u201d Taylor Van Kirk, a spokesman for Vance\u2019s campaign, said in a statement, \u201cJD has been up front about being wrong about President Trump and strongly supported him in 2020. President Trump\u2019s policies rose millions of Americans, of all colors, out of poverty.\u201d Vance was a CNN contributor from March 2017-2018. A March 2022 Fox News poll has investment banker Mike Gibbons leading the crowded field of candidates competing in the GOP primary with 22%, followed by Josh Mandel, former state treasurer, with 20%. Vance is currently polling at 11%, while former state GOP Chair Jane Timken and State Sen. Matt Dolan are at 9 and 7%, respectively. Vance also argued in 2016 that if White working-class people attended church, they would not be as attracted to Trump. \u201cI think Trump provides that sense of community that many in the white working class would have, if they actually went to church,\u201d Vance told New York public radio. \u201cI think if folks went to church a little bit more they may not be as excited or as attracted to the sort of social experience that Trump provides.\u201d During the heat of 2016 presidential election, Vance was even more specific in diagnosing the role racism and xenophobia he said played into Trump\u2019s electoral support. Though he said it was not the largest element or reason for his support, Vance did say racism played an element in support for Trump. \u201cThere is definitely an element of Donald Trump\u2019s support that has its basis in racism, xenophobia, but a lot of these folks are just really hardworking people who are struggling in really important ways,\u201d Vance said in a September 2016 PBS Newshour Interview. He also said in another interview, that \u201crace is definitely a part of the Trump phenomenon\u201d and that Trump\u2019s exploitation of racial resentments In a July 2016 interview with American Conservative, a right-leaning publication, he added Trump was making the problem of racial resentment \u201cworse\u201d by talking about \u201crapist immigrants and banning all Muslims\u201d as part of his message. But Vance went further than identifying race as a part of Trump\u2019s appeal by claiming some voters were attracted to his racial rhetoric because they were racist. \u201cDefinitely some people who voted for Trump were racist and they voted for him for racist reasons,\u201d Vance said in a one-on-one at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics. In a separate 2016 radio interview Vance said that some Trump supporters \u201cobviously don\u2019t have views about race that a lot of us would be comfortable with.\u201d",

Vicente Gonzalez is now running for reelection to Congress in the 34th district, a safer Democratic district than his current one. Abbott, a Republican, did not immediately announce a special election to replace Vela. Vela is a close ally of President Joe Biden and was in talks for a Biden administration position.

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday received and quickly vetoed new congressional boundaries approved by the Republican-controlled legislature, setting up a showdown with his own party over how to proceed with a new map for the state. DeSantis said he will call lawmakers back to Tallahassee next month for a special session to take another stab at redrawing district lines in a way that satisfies his demands. The two sides have been at odds for months as DeSantis has pressed his party\u2019s legislative leaders to pass an aggressive reapportionment of the state\u2019s 28 congressional districts that would eliminate two districts where Black residents are a plurality. Republicans earlier this month defied DeSantis \u2014 who is used to getting his way \u2014 and passed its own map that maintains the same number of Black districts. Lawmakers could override the governor\u2019s veto or punt to the courts and hope their map prevails. But a key Republican state senator previously told CNN that neither of those outcomes are likely, and he now expects the legislature to draw a map that can win the governor\u2019s signature. \u201cWe would have to try again to pass a map that the governor would be interested in signing,\u201d Sen. Ray Rodrigues, the Republican point person on redistricting in the Senate, told CNN last week. \u201cThe maps that would have the best chance of standing up to legal challenge are maps that are passed by both houses of the legislature and signed by the governor.\u201d Florida is one of just five states without a final map, creating widespread uncertainty for midterm candidates who don\u2019t yet know the boundaries of the districts they may be running in. Lawmakers must also account for a new congressional seat after the most recent decennial census. The filing deadline for candidates in Florida is June 17 and the primary election is in August. Florida was once the perennial swing state. 2022 may prove how red it has become Siding with the governor is a path that may lead lawakers to a courtroom \u2013 a scenario Republican lawmakers were trying to avoid when they started the once-a-decade redistricting process. The state House and Senate initially considered maps that adhered more closely to the existing district lines in hopes of fending off a legal challenge. DeSantis has recently acknowledged that he wouldn\u2019t mind if the redistricting fight leads to a legal battle. His own map proposal eliminated two House districts \u2013 the 5th and the 10th \u2013 represented by Black Democrats. It was critiqued by opponents as a clear violation of a state constitutional amendment known as Fair Districts, which requires lawmakers to give minority communities an opportunity to \u201celect representatives of their choice.\u201d DeSantis\u2019 endgame is for a court to deal a blow to the Fair Districts amendment, approved by voters in a ballot referendum last decade to reduce political influence in the map-drawing process. On Tuesday, DeSantis said he believes the way Florida courts interpreted the Fair District amendment last decade could be a violation of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. \u201cOur goal in all of this is to have a constitutional map,\u201d DeSantis said Tuesday. The battle has also earned DeSantis, a potential contender for the White House in 2024, considerable praise from Republicans who want to see the state GOP use their power to push a more partisan map. Prior to the veto on Tuesday, two lawsuits had already been filed asking courts in Florida to set new US House districts, citing DeSantis\u2019 veto threat as evidence of an impasse. Still, lawmakers have an incentive to quickly reach a conclusion to the redistricting fight: State law prohibits lawmakers from fundraising for their campaigns while in Tallahassee for a legislative session, a nuisance that would be especially felt during an election year. If Republicans move toward DeSantis\u2019 demands, Democrats will surely frame it as lawmakers caving to DeSantis. \u201cAt that point, I don\u2019t understand why anyone in the majority conference would want to be a legislator. You\u2019re just a cog in the wheel labeled \u2018Governor DeSantis,\u2019\u201d said House Minority Leader Evan Jenne. \u201cIf you\u2019re just going to abdicate all your responsibilities to someone who is not your constituent, why are you here?\u201d With the US House closely divided, both parties are closely watching the developments in Florida. Despite early predictions that Republican-controlled state houses across the country could draw their party into the House majority, national Democrats have been largely pleased with how they have fared in redistricting. Republicans in many states had already pressed their redistricting advantage last decade when a tea party wave installed GOP leaders in states where governments were previously divided or run by Democrats. There weren\u2019t many opportunities to gain more seats without making incumbents more vulnerable, said Michael McDonald, a political science professor and redistricting researcher at the University of Florida. That wasn\u2019t the case in Florida, where a court installed a map drawn by grassroots reformers in 2015 after years of legal challenges and failures by the GOP legislature to pass a map. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few places in the country where Republicans can gain seats with even a modest gerrymander,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cSuddenly Florida has become really important in this chess board.\u201d This year, Florida\u2019s redistricting process was chugging along without drama when DeSantis unexpectedly unveiled his own map in January, an unprecedented step for a Florida executive. That proposal from DeSantis \u2013 who is up for reelection this fall \u2013 is a much more partisan map, one that could give Republicans the advantage in at least 18 of the 28 districts in the state, and as many as 20. Florida Republicans currently hold 16 seats in the US House to 11 for the Democrats. The DeSantis map would break up the 5th Congressional District, one of four districts in the state where Black voters are a plurality. It is currently represented by Lawson, who is Black. Critics say this tactic could weaken your vote in 2022 DeSantis has said he believes the district, which spans the state\u2019s northern border with Georgia to connect Black communities in Tallahassee and Jacksonville, is unconstitutional. His office has pointed to a 2017 US Supreme Court ruling of a North Carolina congressional seat in which the court said it was unconstitutional in most instances to racially gerrymander a district. DeSantis on Tuesday said the district is an example of a \u201cpure racial gerrymander\u201d intended to get a Democrat elected. Lawson in a statement on Tuesday said DeSantis has \u201cmade it clear that his ultimate objective was to cut the number of African Americans and Hispanic Americans serving in Congress\u201d and he took issue with the governor\u2019s interpretation of the 14th Amendment. \u201cThe fact that DeSantis justifies his goal to create racial disparities in congressional representation by citing the constitutional amendment created following the Civil War for the very purpose of remedying those same disparities is absurd and will be soundly rejected by any credible judge,\u201d Lawson said. National Republicans have eyed Lawson\u2019s seat as a vehicle for future challenges ever since it was implemented by the court. \u201cA lot of people on my side of the aisle believe the Florida Supreme Court imposed a racial gerrymander on the state of Florida and it just hasn\u2019t been challenged,\u201d said Adam Kincaid, president and executive director for the National Republican Redistricting PAC. The organization, created to coordinate and influence GOP redistricting efforts across the country, has not been involved in Florida\u2019s redistricting debate. \u201cWhat you have with the existing Florida 5 is in our view improperly imposed and it was drawn to create a Democratic seat in north Florida,\u201d Kincaid said. For months, state Republican lawmakers rejected similar arguments from DeSantis. They operated under the assumption that a district created by the court would pass constitutional muster and that the state\u2019s Fair District amendment prohibits lawmakers from eliminating a seat that gives Black voters a voice in Congress. In addition to representing Tallahassee and Jacksonville, Lawson\u2019s district also includes Gadsden County, the only Black-majority county in the state, as well as large African American populations in other counties along the Georgia border that once made up the Southern plantation Black Belt. DeSantis\u2019 map would also break up the 10th Congressional District, currently represented by US Rep. Val Demings, a Black Democrat from Orlando now running for US Senate. Rodrigues, who was previously dismissive of DeSantis\u2019 position, now says it warrants consideration. He also said recent US Supreme Court rulings regarding redistricting plans passed in other states may also play a factor. Still, he didn\u2019t know how the state House and Senate would bridge the gap between their approved map and the one DeSantis wants. Already, they had made significant concessions to DeSantis, passing a map that shifts District 5 east to create a new Black access district around Jacksonville. \u201cThe governor has a legitimate point,\u201d Rodrigues said. \u201cLet\u2019s see if there\u2019s a way the map can be drawn to address it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "The days of Mike Pence defending Donald Trump\u2019s controversial praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin are over, sources close to the former vice president told CNN. Days after Pence condemned \u201capologists for Putin\u201d in reference to Trump and other Republicans who have made positive comments about the Russian dictator amid his devastating invasion of Ukraine, the former vice president\u2019s allies said he feels compelled to share his own long-held opinions on the matter, which he refrained from doing publicly during his time as Trump\u2019s second-in-command. As Pence prepares for a possible White House bid in 2024, the Russian invasion has provided him with a new opportunity to distinguish himself from Trump and underscore the foreign policy chops he\u2019s developed over two decades in government. That separation is also coming at a time when Pence is ramping up his political activities through his Advancing American Freedom group \u2013 from raising money for Republican candidates in the 2022 midterm elections and launching TV ads targeting vulnerable Democrats to releasing a \u201cfreedom agenda\u201d for conservatives to utilize in upcoming elections. Pence has been looking for opportunities to denounce what he perceives to be an alarming trend inside the GOP of Trump-aligned figures expressing adulation for the Kremlin leader, according to one person familiar with his thinking. \u201cWhen you are vice president, there is an obligation to support the president\u2019s policies and when you disagree, to share those disagreements in private. Now, there isn\u2019t that same constraint, so [Pence] can be more vocal about his viewpoints,\u201d this person said. Those around Pence say his stepping out on Ukraine reflects that the Indiana Republican has his \u201cown voice\u201d and a distinct political brand from the former President he served. That was on display last week during his visit to the Ukraine-Poland border with Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an evangelical international relief agency run by Franklin Graham. And his long-standing party loyalty gave Pence a prime speaking spot at this month\u2019s Republican National Committee donor retreat in New Orleans, where he plainly declared, \u201cThere is no room in this party for apologists for Putin. There is only room for champions of freedom.\u201d Pence advocacy group launches $10 million ad campaign hitting Biden on Ukraine and energy Then, on Wednesday, Pence again took aim at the Russian leader in an interview with Fox News, saying that Putin is fully responsible for the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. \u201cThere is one person to blame for this invasion. It\u2019s Vladimir Putin, and Putin must pay for the violence,\u201d Pence told the network shortly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a virtual address to members of Congress. Though Pence declined to mention Trump by name in his New Orleans appearance, his sharp rebuke came on the heels of the former President calling Putin \u201csavvy\u201d and \u201cgenius\u201d as the Russian leader launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Those comments have left Trump isolated from other Republican leaders \u2013 including many of his own allies \u2013 who have refused to echo his praise and instead unambiguously denounced Putin\u2019s actions. \u201cI do not think anything\u2019s savvy or genius with Putin,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has remained close to Trump since the former President left office, told reporters last week. \u201cI think Putin is evil. He is a dictator. And I think he\u2019s murdering people right now.\u201d One person close to Pence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said his team felt the donor retreat in early March presented \u201cthe right opportunity\u201d for him to address Trump\u2019s comments at a moment where \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of Republicans disagree with his take on Putin. This person said Pence will continue to speak out against those who praise the Russian leader within the GOP \u201cto the extent that it continues to be an issue.\u201d \u201cThe nation has coalesced around the idea that Putin is a thug, that he is evil and that what he is doing is reprehensible,\u201d this person said. Recent polling supports that assessment, including a CNN poll in late February that found overwhelming support among Americans for economic sanctions against Russia, including from 84% of Republicans. A Quinnipiac poll from the same time found that just 6% of Republicans have favorable views of Putin. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart move, because the former President is completely out of step with the party and the country when it comes to Putin, and it\u2019s one of the few issues everyone is willing to push away from Trump on,\u201d said David Kochel, a veteran Republican strategist. Although he has taken issue with Trump\u2019s recent positive comments about Putin, Pence has echoed the former President\u2019s criticism of his successor. In the same speech to GOP donors, Pence accused President Joe Biden of squandering \u201cthe deterrence that our administration put in place to keep Putin and Russia from even trying to redraw international boundaries by force.\u201d And like Trump, the former vice president has called on the Biden administration to sanction Russian oil exports. Still, Pence\u2019s recent comments mark a far cry from how he had typically weighed in as Trump\u2019s running mate and vice president when he would comment on Putin or Russia. For years, as Trump lavished praise on Putin, his fiercely loyal vice president would surface soon afterward to reframe Trump\u2019s comments to make them more palatable. For instance, when Trump said during a 2016 campaign appearance that Putin had been \u201ca leader far more than\u201d then-President Barack Obama, Pence quickly insisted it wasn\u2019t an endorsement of the Russian autocrat. Addressing the matter during his vice presidential debate against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Pence recast Trump\u2019s comments as \u201can indictment of the weak and feckless leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama,\u201d while describing Putin as \u201csmall\u201d and \u201cbullying.\u201d Then, when Trump appeared to equate US actions with Putin\u2019s authoritarian regime during a Fox interview early in his presidency, Pence assured Americans that Trump was not drawing \u201ca moral equivalency.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of killers. You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d Trump said during the interview in response to a question about why he respects Putin even though the Russian leader is a \u201ckiller.\u201d Pence rebuked Trump -- and received an outpouring of GOP support in response And when the then-President sided with Putin over US intelligence officials during their 2018 joint news conference in Helsinki, Finland \u2013 suggesting at the time that he didn\u2019t \u201csee any reason why\u201d Russia would have interfered in the 2016 US presidential election despite widespread evidence to the contrary \u2013  Pence rushed to defend the \u201chistoric trip\u201d and lauded Trump\u2019s commitment \u201cto put the prosperity and security of America first.\u201d Pence allies say he has always bristled at praise of Putin inside the GOP but is now in a place where he can share long-held opinions publicly without breaching decorum. So far, these allies said Pence hasn\u2019t received any blowback for crossing Trump on the Putin matter and noted that he has been in regular contact with a range of foreign policy and national security experts as he decides how and when to weigh in on the Ukraine-Russia crisis. \u201cMike Pence does have his own voice, his own opinions and his own views,\u201d said one of the people close to the former vice president. Ukraine is not the first area where Pence has sought to draw a contrast with Trump. At the top of the list are their divergent views of the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and Pence\u2019s refusal to halt certification of the 2020 election. In recent weeks, Pence has been increasingly vocal in defending his refusal to delay the counting of electoral votes, as Trump and some of his top allies pressured him to do. Speaking at the Federalist Society Florida Chapters conference near Orlando last month, Pence called Trump\u2019s efforts to challenge the results of the election \u201cun-American\u201d and warned against conservatives who continue to insist that the vice president can alter an election. He has periodically said that he and Trump will never see \u201ceye to eye\u201d on January 6. Afterward, Pence fielded calls from donors, Republican lawmakers and top conservative leaders eager to privately applaud him.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump traveled to Florence, South Carolina, over the weekend to deliver the latest in a series of campaign-style speeches as he hints at running for president again in 2024. With a shoutout to CNN\u2019s Christian Sierra, I was able to get a transcript of the speech. The lines you need to see from it are below. 1. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing out here. But we\u2019re gonna warm it up. We\u2019re gonna warm it up.\u201d \u201cWarm it up, Kris/I\u2019m about to.\u201d And away we go! 2. \u201cJust show the crowd. They never do it. They never do it.\u201d This is an oldie but goodie for Trump. He spent much of the 2016 \u2013 and 2020 \u2013 campaign insisting a) his crowds were massive and b) the media refused to show the crowds because they were so big. It has never been true that the media refused to show them. 3. \u201cWe had a big victory. And we actually had an honest vote count.\u201d Trump won South Carolina by 12 points over Joe Biden in 2020.  And he still hasn\u2019t proven that there was widespread fraud in any vote count in the country. 4. \u201cHe abolished our southern border.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of fair criticism of Joe Biden\u2019s border policy \u2013 you can read some of it here. But one thing Biden didn\u2019t do is \u201cabolish\u201d the border. 5. \u201cMillions and millions of people, many of them from jails from other countries, are being dumped into our country.\u201d [narrator voice] No, they aren\u2019t. 6. \u201cThere were more Covid deaths in 2021 then in all of 2020 and hospitalizations shattered every record even while Biden imposed illegal mandates all over the place.\u201d It\u2019s true that there were more deaths attributed to Covid in 2021 than 2020. But it\u2019s also worth remembering that Covid didn\u2019t hit in full force in America until March 2020. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 7. \u201cYou can take the five worst presidents in American history and put them together, and they would not have done the damage Joe Biden has done in just 13 months.\u201d Who are the five worst US presidents, you ask? According to C-SPAN\u2019s 2021 survey of presidential historians, they are: James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Franklin Pierce, William Henry Harrison and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Donald Trump. 8. \u201cWe have a president representing our country at the most important time in history, who is physically and mentally challenged.\u201d What evidence did Trump give that Biden is \u201cphysically and mentally challenged?\u201d Oh, none. 9. \u201cRussia would not have dared to annex one inch of territory if I was in the White House.\u201d It\u2019s not at all clear that Trump can make this claim. While he has repeatedly insisted that no one had been tougher on Russia as president than he had, there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that it\u2019s true. Also, not for nothing, Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump. 10. \u201cIt was always \u2018America first.\u2019 Very simple, very simple. It\u2019s all about America first. It was also about \u2018make America great again,\u2019 but it was about America first because that\u2019s how you make it great.\u201d So, MAGA \u2013 or something? 11. \u201cI hate to do it, and I hate to tell you, but our nuclear weapons \u2013 I rebuilt them and we have brand new \u2013 and I hate to even mention it because the last thing we ever want to use is nuclear weapons.\u201d [narrator voice] He doesn\u2019t hate to tell you this. 12. \u201cAnd you never want to use it, but the way you don\u2019t use it is by letting everyone know that we have it bigger and better, stronger than they do.\u201d Donald Trump on the possibility of using nuclear weapons: \u201cThe way you don\u2019t use it is by letting everyone know that we have it bigger and better, stronger than they do.\u201d 13. \u201cWe got rid of ISIS 100%\u201d Nope! 14. \u201cWe respected each other, but I said President [Xi], we\u2019re eating chocolate cake. And it was beautiful chocolate cake.\u201d Trump apparently told Chinese President Xi Jinping about American airstrikes in Syria in 2017 over chocolate cake. Oh, excuse me, over \u201cbeautiful\u201d chocolate cake. 15. \u201cI have to tell you, not that you go back to your beautiful room and say he never even told me that.\u201d \u201cBeautiful room.\u201d Much like the aforementioned cake. 16. \u201cSo he knew everything we were saying, so don\u2019t talk behind their back.\u201d In which Trump says he didn\u2019t think President Xi spoke or understood English, but then realized he did. Good preparation! 17. \u201cBut actually, my personality is what kept us out of war.\u201d \u201cWill someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in 2018. 18. \u201cAnd Adam \u2013 Adam Kinzinger, you ever see him? He gets on television. He cries all the time. He starts crying.\u201d As far as I can tell, what Trump is referring to is the fact that the Illinois Republican congressman was near tears during a hearing with four police officers who were in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. So, yeah. 19. \u201cWe call him Crying Adam Kinzinger.\u201d \u201cI call him Cryin\u2019 Chuck because I saw him cry one time while making a speech. I said, \u2018Isn\u2019t that sad? I\u2019ve never seen him cry before.\u2019 I call him Cryin\u2019 Chuck.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump on Chuck Schumer, in 2019. And, yes, he is just recycling his old material at this point. 20. \u201cWe also have to clean out the rot of our failed foreign policy establishment.\u201d Say \u201cDeep State\u201d without saying \u201cDeep State.\u201d 21. \u201cWe have to continue to drain the swamp. We did a lot of it, but the swamp was deep, deeper than anybody believed.\u201d The biggest swamp in the world is the Pantanal, which is on the border of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. Information for life! 22. \u201cYou had somebody to talk to [Vladimir Putin] with me. Nobody was ever tougher on Russia than me.\u201d \u201cI hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. We\u2019ve all been foolish. We\u2019re all to blame.\u201d \u2013 Donald Trump on Russian meddling in the 2016 election. And, oh yeah, he was standing next to Putin in Helsinki when he said this. 23. \u201cWe break Elvis\u2019 records. We were in Texas, two weeks ago. \u2026 They turned away 50,000 people.\u201d Yes, he is still talking about crowd size. In particular, the crowd at a rally at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds on January 29 of this year. The Houston Chronicle said the crowd numbered in the \u201cthousands,\u201d although there was no mention of 50,000 people being turned away. 24. \u201cSo we made a lot of really great stars sitting there.\u201d I think Trump is saying that the people who sat behind him at campaign rallies became stars because they were on television. So, yeah. 25. \u201cNow Biden is crawling around the globe on his knees begging and pleading for mercy from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela.\u201d Remember when past presidents would refuse to make any public comment about their successor? Good times. Gooooooood times. 26. \u201cThe woman that thought of the Green New Deal didn\u2019t even go to a college to study.\u201d Trump appears to be talking about New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez here \u2013 who went to Boston University and graduated in 2011 with a degree in international relations and economics. 27. \u201cThe world is going to be destroyed because the oceans are going to rise 1/100 of an inch within the next 300 years. It\u2019s going to kill everybody. It\u2019s going to create more oceanfront property. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to do.\u201d Trump is mocking climate change activists here. If you know literally anything about science, it\u2019s not funny. 28. \u201cThe real threat we have is the nuclear threat. That\u2019s going to be the global warming if we ever let that ever happen.\u201d See, because a nuclear bomb would cause a massive heat flash \u2026 so, global warming \u2026 [lays head down on desk]. 29. \u201cHe must think we are the stupidest people.\u201d Donald Trump on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Also: USA! USA! 30. \u201cHis oil is no good. It\u2019s very heavy. You got to put it through the wringer to get oil out of it.\u201d Apparently heavy oil \u2013 or \u201cthick crude\u201d \u2013 is a thing. Live and learn! 31. \u201cWe have the best oil in the world. \u2026 I call it liquid gold.\u201d \u201cI love gold.\u201d \u2013 Goldmember 32. \u201cI don\u2019t think she ever took a course in the environment.\u201d And now Trump is back to Ocasio-Cortez. And, no, he likely doesn\u2019t have a clue which courses she took in college. 33. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is with bikers, but I think I had 100% of that vote.\u201d Uh huh. 34. \u201cThen we had an election result that everybody or most people know was a fake result.\u201d Say it with me: There is NO evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. NONE. 35. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our country. It\u2019s no different than if we had lost it in a war.\u201d I\u2019ll take, \u201crhetoric that can incite violence,\u201d for $500 please, Alex. 36. \u201cIf he respected our president, it would have never ever happened.\u201d To be clear: Trump is saying that Putin wouldn\u2019t have invaded Ukraine if he had been president because the Russian president respected him. Righto. 37. \u201cIf you want chaos, if you want crime, if you want carnage, you must immediately vote for radical Democrats, because they will give it to you.\u201d This feels like a slight oversimplification. 38. \u201cHe\u2019s respected by no one, he\u2019s laughed at in Washington.\u201d Trump on South Carolina Rep. Tom Rice, who was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him for his actions on January 6, 2021. For Trump, being laughed at is the worst thing the world. 39. \u201cIn the 1st Congressional District, you have another horrendous RINO known as Crazy Nancy Mace.\u201d Trump is really hard up for new nicknames. He has, in the past referred to Biden, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maxine Waters as \u201ccrazy.\u201d Now he\u2019s doing the same for the South Carolina congresswoman. 40. \u201cShe\u2019s a terrible person. And she has no idea what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Trump on Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. What\u2019s weird is how normal this sort of rhetoric has become. In years past, a former Republican President saying anything close to this about a Republican member of Congress would have been news for days. 41. \u201c33 endorsements \u2013 we won 33 races.\u201d Read this on Trump\u2019s much-bragged-about record in this month\u2019s Texas primaries. 42. \u201cThe fate of any nation ultimately depends upon the willingness of its citizens to lay down \u2013 and they must do this \u2013 lay down their very lives to defend their country. If we allow the Marxists and communists and socialists to teach our children to hate America, there will be no one left to defend our flag or to protect our great country or its freedom.\u201d In which the former President of the United States says people should \u201clay down their very lives\u201d to protect the country against \u2026 wait for it \u2026 critical race theory. 43. \u201cIt was fraudulent and loaded up with irregularities. In other words, it was rigged.\u201d [narrator voice] There is no evidence of widespread fraud in  the 2020 election. None. 44. \u201cSo I ran twice, I won twice, and I did much better the second time that we did the first \u2013 getting 12 million more votes. And now we may have to run again.\u201d He didn\u2019t win twice. Just saying. 45. \u201cOur election was rigged. And we can never let this happen again. And we will continue to go forward, but we will also never ever forget what happened.\u201d So, we need to looks backward and forward? At the same time? 46. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win like never before.\u201d What, exactly, would that sort of winning look like? 47. \u201cWe are going to take back the Senate and we are going to take back America. And in 2024, we are going to take back that beautiful, beautiful White House. I wonder who will do that. I wonder, I wonder.\u201d I don\u2019t know! Who could it be?!?! Yeah, this feels like a good place to end.",

            "article_content": "First, it was the feud between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Florida Sen. Rick Scott over the latter\u2019s 11-point plan to \u201crescue\u201d America if Republicans win majorities in Congress this fall. Now, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has caused a stir by suggesting \u2013 and then un-suggesting \u2013 that Republicans would work to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they retake power in Washington. \u201cFor example, if we\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare \u2014 I still think we need to fix our health-care system \u2014 we need to have the plan ahead of time so that once we get in office, we can implement it immediately, not knock around like we did last time and fail,\u201d Johnson said during a Breitbart News Radio interview Monday morning first flagged by The Washington Post. That would be a very big deal! After all, congressional Republicans spent the better part of the last decade \u2013 legislatively and legally \u2013 trying to dismantle the ACA. They repeatedly failed in that effort. And despite a rocky start to the health care program \u2013 the failure of the initial website to sign up for coverage being the most obvious example \u2013 the public has warmed to the law, which is colloquially known as Obamacare. In an October 2021 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, almost 6 in 10 (58%) of Americans said they had a favorable view of the law, while just 41% viewed it unfavorably. Taking the ACA away \u2013 or even talking about taking it away \u2013 then is politically unwise. Which may explain why Johnson, who faces re-election this year, released a statement Monday night, um, clarifying his position. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cDuring a radio interview I used our failure to repeal and replace Obamacare as an example of how we need to be prepared to deliver on whatever agenda items we decide to run on,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI was not suggesting repealing and replacing Obamacare should be one of those priorities. Even when we tried and failed, I consistently said our effort should focus on repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transitioning to a health system that works.\u201d Which, well, ok! But, the problem for Johnson \u2013 and for McConnell and other members of Republican leadership \u2013 is that Johnson initially said what he said, which sounded a whole lot like Republicans would work to repeal and replace Obamacare if they were in the Senate majority. It\u2019s the latest problem for McConnell caused by members of his own conference, a series of self-inflicted wounds that give Democrats some hope that they may be able to retain their razor-thin majority in the Senate come November. Much of last week was taken up with a public back and forth between McConnell and Scott, the chair of Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, over the Florida Republican\u2019s decision to release his own policy agenda for America if/when Republicans regain the majority. The provisions in Scott\u2019s plan include finishing construction of the southern border wall and naming it after former President Donald Trump, requiring all Americans to pay income taxes, and establishing a sunset provision for all federal legislation after five years. \u201cWe will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years,\u201d McConnell said in response last week. \u201cThat will not be a part of the Republican Senate majority agenda.\u201d Not long after, Scott penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing: \u201cIf we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to socialism, we don\u2019t deserve to govern. Most Republicans in Congress agree, but many live in fear of speaking the truth in Washington.\u201d No sooner had that back and forth abated \u2013 for the time being \u2013 than this kerfuffle with Johnson sprung up, drawing swift Democratic condemnation. All of it works against McConnell\u2019s most basic premise heading into the 2022 midterms: Make the entire election a referendum on President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats. That notion appears to be harder to execute in practice than to follow in principle.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday night, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was forced into a May Republican primary runoff with George P. Bush, a victory for the Bush family in their long-running feud with former President Donald Trump. Paxton had been endorsed in the race by Trump, who called the embattled attorney general \u201cstrong on Crime, Border Security, the Second Amendment, Election Integrity and, above all, our Constitution.\u201d Bush, on the other hand, is the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a scion of the most famous family in establishment Republican politics. His father and Trump feuded regularly during the course of the 2016 campaign. Neither Jeb Bush nor his brother, former President George W. Bush, voted for Trump in 2016. (George W. Bush also revealed he didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2020.) Their late mother, Barbara Bush, said of Trump: \u201cHe sort of makes faces and says insulting things.\u201d \u201cI guess what I\u2019d say is, clearly, to the establishment: They got what they wanted,\u201d Paxton said in a speech to supporters late Tuesday. \u201cThey got me in a runoff.\u201d With an estimated 96% of the vote in, Paxton stood at 43%, while George P. Bush was at 23%. The rest of the vote was split among two other primary challengers. Paxton and Bush will face off again on May 24. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Now, while it\u2019s fascinating to see the race \u2013 and the results \u2013 as a proxy war between the old face of the Republican Party (the Bushes) and its new face (Trump), the reality is slightly more nuanced. First, Paxton finds himself in significant legal jeopardy. In 2015, shortly after being elected as Texas attorney general, Paxton was indicted on charges of securities fraud. He pleaded not guilty and the trial continues to be delayed amid legal wrangling on both sides. Then, in October 2020, seven Paxton aides accused him of bribery and abuse of office \u2013 charges that Paxton denied. (The FBI is reportedly looking into the allegations.) Bush, who currently serves as Texas Land Commissioner, made Paxton\u2019s legal problems a key part of his case against the incumbent. In a speech on Tuesday night, he argued that nominating Paxton would cost Republicans the office in the fall. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake in this race,\u201d he said, according to the Texas Tribune. \u201cThat\u2019s what this campaign is about. It\u2019s not about one individual. It\u2019s about preserving conservative values in our state.\u201d Second, Bush isn\u2019t exactly a chip off the old block. While his father called Trump \u201cunhinged\u201d during the 2016 primary campaign, the younger Bush has been much more willing to bend the knee to the former President. In the days before he formally entered the attorney race in the summer of 2021, George P. Bush tweeted a picture of himself on a cell phone with this caption: \u201cGreat to speak with President Trump to discuss the future of Texas and how we are keeping up the fight to put America first. I appreciate the words of encouragement and support.\u201d At the announcement itself, Bush supporters were handing out koozies that featured a drawing of him and Trump with a 2019 quote from the former President that read: \u201cThis is the only Bush that likes me. This is the Bush that got it right. I like him.\u201d (George P. Bush endorsed Trump in the 2020 race, calling him \u201cthe only thing standing between America and socialism.\u201d) So, like I said, it\u2019s not totally clear-cut that Paxton\u2019s failure to avoid a runoff  is purely a referendum on the Bush family vs. Trump dynamic. But whether George P. Bush has said nice things about Trump in the past (and vice-versa), it is unmistakably true that he is the son of Jeb Bush and that Trump weighed in for Paxton early and strongly in the primary fight. Which means this is something of a proxy fight between the two sides. And it\u2019s only going to get more intense over the next two and a half months.",

            "article_content": "Two of the biggest names in Texas politics could be headed to overtime in their efforts to fend off primary challengers. Texas kicked off the nation\u2019s 2022 midterm election calendar Tuesday, holding the nation\u2019s first primaries. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott easily defeated two vocal but poor-performing rivals and is now set for a marquee battle with Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman, in the fall, per CNN projections. But down-ballot, the primary fireworks aren\u2019t over yet: Texas requires candidates to top 50% in order to advance directly to the general election. Otherwise, the top two primary finishers square off in a head-to-head runoff in May. CNN projected that embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton will face a runoff against state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the latest member of the Bush family\u2019s political dynasty to emerge in Texas politics. Paxton\u2019s failure to reach the 50% threshold was the only negative mark on Tuesday for former President Donald Trump, whose slate of endorsed candidates largely cruised in GOP primaries. And the Democratic primary in Texas\u2019 28th District \u2013 between Rep. Henry Cuellar, the party\u2019s most conservative member of the US House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros \u2013 was still undecided as of early Wednesday morning. Here are six takeaways from the Texas primaries: Texas is set for a heavyweight match-up between Abbott, a prolific fundraiser with a $50 million war chest, and O\u2019Rourke, the former Democratic congressman who has been his party\u2019s only hope at winning statewide in recent years. Poll worker shortages and other glitches emerge as Texans kick off this year's primary election season Abbott, who is seeking a third term, was always the favorite to win his party\u2019s nomination despite far-right criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in its early days. But he spent $15 million to be sure of it, fending off former Florida congressman and Texas Republican Party chairman Allen West and former state Sen. Don Huffines. O\u2019Rourke, meanwhile, is seeking office for the third time in five years. His near-miss in the 2018 race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz ignited Texas Democrats\u2019 hopes that the state, with a diverse and growing population and suburbs that have moved leftward, would soon become a battleground. Now, with a campaign focused on Abbott\u2019s management of the grid failure that left much of Texas without power after a winter storm last year, he\u2019ll seek to deliver on that promise in a year in which the national political environment could be much tougher for Democrats. Texas Attorney General Paxton was unable to reach the 50% support he needed to avoid a runoff, and will face a head-to-head match-up with a member of the state\u2019s best-known political family. Paxton, a Republican with former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement thanks to the attorney general\u2019s lawsuit seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, faced a crowded field of challengers. The efforts to oust him center on his legal troubles: Paxton has been under indictment since 2015 on securities fraud charges, and is being investigated by the FBI after former aides accused him of abusing the power of his office to help a political donor. As votes were being counted late Tuesday night, the second-leading vote-getter was Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He led former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and US Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Trump ally. Bush had aligned himself much more closely with Trump than other members of the Bush family. He told supporters Tuesday night that Paxton \u201cis going to divert attention away from his legal problems and personal challenges\u201d during their runoff. The rematch between Rep. Henry Cuellar, the most conservative Democrat in the US House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros, who nearly defeated him in 2020, was neck-and-neck Tuesday night. It could be headed for a runoff. Though Cuellar and Cisneros are both from Laredo, the race split along geographic lines: Counties closer to San Antonio overwhelmingly supported the more progressive Cisneros; along the border, Cuellar was dominant. Cuellar is a rare figure in Washington: a pro-gun rights, anti-abortion rights Democrat who outperforms the national party in an area where Democrats have rapidly lost ground to Republicans in recent presidential election cycles. The FBI searched Cuellar\u2019s house weeks before the primary election. He largely dropped off the campaign trail, relying on television ads. That progressives could not defeat a hobbled Cuellar offered a window into the party\u2019s left flank\u2019s struggles to connect with Latinos in South Texas. Progressives did have one victory to celebrate Tuesday night: Greg Casar, a former Austin city councilman, was projected to win the 35th Congressional District primary outright, avoiding a runoff. Casar, who was endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and campaigned with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is the favorite to win the seat in November. The 35th District, which stretches from Austin to San Antonio, is a new one drawn by Texas lawmakers during last year\u2019s redistricting. It became a target for progressives after Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, the incumbent who had represented parts of the new district, chose to run in a neighboring district. The most competitive US House race in Texas this year could come in the 15th District, a South Texas district that stretches from towns east of San Antonio to the Rio Grande Valley. A roadmap to the 2022 midterm elections Republican Monica De La Cruz, who came within 3 percentage points of defeating Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in 2020, will win the Republican nomination, CNN projected. Gonzalez, meanwhile, is running in the neighboring 34th District. But Democrats will have to wait until May 24 to determine her opponent. On Tuesday, the results of the Democratic primary remained to be seen. Ruben Ramirez, an attorney and Afghanistan war veteran, led the field, followed by a tight contest between Michelle Vallejo, a progressive favorite, and attorney John Villarreal Rigney for the second runoff spot. Trump took a victory lap Tuesday night after every candidate he endorsed in Texas either won or advanced to a runoff. \u201cBig night in Texas! All 33 candidates that were Trump endorsed have either won their primary election or are substantially leading in the case of a runoff,\u201d Trump said in a statement. Faulty ballots and frustration: Texans confront 'nightmare' effects of new election law as early voting kicks off That was partly by design: Trump only endorsed Republicans who were either already favored or were locks to win. His endorsement carried weight, but was not enough to help Paxton avoid a runoff. Trump did not involve himself in the 8th District race to replace retiring US Rep. Kevin Brady. But virtually all of his allies, and every other power player in the GOP, did.",

            "article_content": "Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday rebutted Florida Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s plan \u201cto rescue America,\u201d trying to keep attention on Republicans\u2019 perceived failures of the Biden administration as the party looks to take back the Senate this year. Scott, the chairman of the National Republican Senate Committee, released an 11-point plan last week offering a range of fiscally conservative and Trumpian proposals, including ending imports from China, cutting the federal government workforce by 25% and building a wall on the US-Mexico border and naming it after former President Donald Trump. But the White House and Democratic congressional candidates quickly zeroed in on an idea in Scott\u2019s proposal that would raise taxes \u2013 \u201cAll Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,\u201d it said \u2013 causing a backlash among some conservative policy wonks and Republican political strategists. Asked about the proposal at a press conference on Tuesday, McConnell firmly stated that Scott\u2019s plan was not his vision. \u201cLet me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWe will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.\u201d Fact-checking Sen. Rick Scott's claims his new plan does not raise people's taxes \u201cThat will not be part of the Republican Senate majority agenda,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cWe will focus instead on what the American people are concerned about: inflation, energy, defense, the border and crime.\u201d McConnell\u2019s rebuke of Scott \u2013 a rare public admonishment of one of his top lieutenants \u2013 demonstrated fissures within the GOP over how to win key Senate races that could determine which party controls the upper chamber after the November elections. Scott\u2019s plan was meant to jump-start a policy discussion as the 2022 national political environment favors Republicans and their chances to take back the House and Senate. At the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, Scott had a booth to circulate paper copies of his plan and free wine glasses engraved, \u201cAmerica is worth fighting for. Read my plan at rescueamerica.com.\u201d Asked last week about raising income taxes, Scott said that as governor of Florida, he cut taxes and fees \u201c100 times,\u201d but wanted a \u201cfair\u201d tax system, trying to portray his proposal as a tax increase on the wealthy rather than the poor. \u201cMy focus is to make sure that it\u2019s fair,\u201d Scott told CNN. \u201cI want to make people\u2019s taxes lower, but at the same time, you got billionaires out there that don\u2019t pay income tax.\u201d \u201cBillionaires ought to pay their fair share,\u201d he added. But after McConnell\u2019s remarks on Tuesday, Scott said that he wanted \u201ca conservation about able-bodied Americans who are living off of government programs instead of working\u201d and blamed Democrats for misleading the public about his plan. He also pushed back on McConnell\u2019s remarks. \u201cI agree with Senator McConnell that this election will primarily be about Joe Biden and the Democrats\u2019 failures, but have been clear that I also believe Republicans should talk about a plan for turning this country around,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI\u2019m a business guy and I\u2019ve always believed in making plans in order to get things done.\u201d \u201cRepublicans, and really all Americans outside of Washington, are demanding it,\u201d he added. \u201cI will continue talking about my plan to rescue America from these radical Democrats.\u201d Scott has marched to the beat of his own drum ever since he entered the Senate in 2019. While other newly elected lawmakers were sworn in at the US Capitol, Scott stayed back in Tallahassee, where he continued to serve as governor after refusing to resign his seat. Scott joined the Senate several days later \u2013 after making dozens of last-minute appointments that angered his successor, fellow Republican Ron DeSantis \u2013 and was sworn in alone. Nor has Scott been shy about bucking the Republican Party in the past. A former health care executive, Scott emerged out of nowhere and spent tens of millions of dollars of his own fortune to claim the GOP nomination for Florida governor in 2010 over an establishment favorite. After winning, his two terms as governor were often marked by dustups with his own party, which controlled the Legislature. And when two sons of Florida ran for president in 2016 \u2013 Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio \u2013 Scott endorsed neither and offered glowing praise instead for Trump. Some Republicans praised Scott last week as he unveiled his plan, which he emphasized was a product by him and not the NRSC. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker whose 1994 Contract with America provided the blueprints for future conservative legislative agendas, praised Scott\u2019s proposals as \u201ca very important contribution toward a positive, problem-solving Republican party.\u201d And Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, said the plan would lower costs, create jobs, support police and secure the border, adding Scott offered a \u201cclear plan to protect and reinvigorate the America we know and love.\u201d House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy also plans on releasing an agenda later this year. \u201cI hope we have a real conversation about what Republicans stand for,\u201d Scott told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s good for us.\u201d But Republicans like McConnell disagree, arguing that the 2022 elections are a referendum on the party in power \u2013 the Democrats \u2013 and that the time to put forward an agenda is after Republicans take power. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Biden\u2019s presidential approval rating at 37%, a new low, and his handling of the economy, the Ukraine crisis and the coronavirus pandemic underwater. \u201cI think Republican senators would hope that Rick Scott would stay focused right now on the job of being chairman of the Senate election committee,\u201d said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership team. Democrats seized on Scott\u2019s plan and tried to elevate it as the Republican party\u2019s platform. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office circulated a study from the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution\u2019s Tax Policy Center showing that Scott\u2019s tax proposal would raise tax revenues in 2022 by more than $100 billion, increasing taxes predominately on households making less than $100,000 a year. Florida Rep. Val Demings, a Democratic candidate for the US Senate, cut an ad attacking Rubio for Scott\u2019s \u201ctax hike.\u201d Last week, Scott predicted that his plans would cause a firestorm. \u201cIt will be ridiculed by the \u2018woke\u2019 left, mocked by Washington insiders, and strike fear in the heart of some Republicans,\u201d Scott wrote in a letter accompanying his plan. \u201cAt least I hope so. It\u2019s a start.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The midterm election season kicked off Tuesday in Texas \u2013 with election workers, voters and voting rights activists reporting several glitches, including poll worker shortages in several counties and a delay in tabulating ballots in heavily populated Harris County. But election officials in the Lone Star State identified the biggest challenge as the scramble to fix the higher-than-usual number of mail-in ballots flagged for potential rejection under the state\u2019s restrictive new voting law. Officials in Harris County \u2013 home to Houston \u2013 had flagged as faulty nearly 30% of the more than 38,000 mail-in ballots received as of Monday because voters did not include identifying information on the return envelope, the county\u2019s election chief Isabel Longoria told reporters Tuesday morning. That meant voters were likely to cast more provisional ballots than typical on Election Day, she added. Ken Paxton and George P. Bush will advance to May runoff in Texas attorney general primary, CNN projects Harris County elections officials were confident Wednesday they would meet the deadline to count votes and disputed earlier reports of \u201cdamaged ballots,\u201d even as the Texas secretary of state\u2019s office stood by that characterization and raised concerns about the delay. As polls closed Tuesday, Harris County officials had warned of delays in reporting results, according to a news release from state election officials. The issue, according to state officials: damaged ballot sheets that must be duplicated before they can be scanned and tabulated. But Harris County election officials later said that this was merely a \u201cpreliminary discussion\u201d of a possible delay. \u201cThis was a discussion because there are new civil penalties in place because of SB 1 to figure out what the best course of action is should there be a delay,\u201d Leah Shah, the county communications director, told CNN, referring to the new Texas voting law. \u201cI don\u2019t have concerns about counting the election ballots for this election,\u201d Isabel Longoria, Harris County Elections administrator, told reporters at a news conference. Tuesday marked the first primaries of the year. On the ballot in Texas were races for governor and a slew of statewide and legislative offices. If no candidate achieves more than 50% support, a runoff election is slated for May. It also marked the first test of a new voting law passed by the Republican-controlled legislature last year. The law imposes new ID requirements to vote by mail, empowers partisan poll watchers and bans practices used by Harris County in 2020, such as 24-hour and drive-thru voting. Texans who qualify to vote by mail felt the first consequences of the new law. It required them to include identification numbers both when applying for a mail-in ballot and again on the inside flap of the envelope they use to return the ballot \u2013 a process that tripped up many in recent weeks. Those problems surfaced again at polling places on Tuesday. Joseph Egbon said he voted in person Tuesday because election officials rejected his mail-in ballot a few days ago. \u201cIt was just last week they sent me the letter,\u201d Egbon told CNN. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to argue so I said, \u2018Let me just go ahead\u2019\u201d and vote in person. Egbon said it was relatively easy to do so. It took just 15 minutes him to vote at the Bayland Park Community Center in southwestern Houston. Only a subset of Texas voters are eligible to cast ballots by mail. They include those 65 and older, people who will be out of the county and voters who are disabled or ill. This election represented the first time Delores Jones, 65, was eligible to vote by mail. It didn\u2019t work out so well. Jones said she applied for a mail-in ballot but never received one. Her neighbor, Ella Clark, 78, said she voted by mail but couldn\u2019t tell whether her ballot had been received. So, they both turned up to vote in person Tuesday. \u201cNot taking a chance,\u201d Jones said, describing her decision. Mail-in voting in Texas this year, she added, seems \u201cunreliable.\u201d Another Houston resident \u2013 Jimmie Williams, 87 \u2013 has voted by mail for a decade and was waiting this year for Harris County election officials to send him a mail-in ballot application so he could do so again. But the new law bans election officials from sending out unsolicited mail-in ballot applications.  And by the time Williams realized that, it was too late, he said. So, he joined other voters at the Sunnyside Multi-Service Center in a southeast Houston neighborhood to cast a ballot. His voting ensemble included a cowboy hat, two face masks and gloves in Tuesday\u2019s 70-degree weather \u2013 all part of his effort to guard against a Covid-19 infection, he said. \u201cThe only person who is going to look at for you, is yourself,\u201d he said. Others around the Houston area interviewed by CNN on Tuesday described a relatively easy process for those who had planned to vote on Election Day. Trent Hollywood Henderson, 57, said it took him about 15 minutes to cast a ballot at a multi-service center early Tuesday before heading off to his job as a mail carrier for the US Postal Service. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad of an experience,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThere were about eight people in front of me when I got in and about 13 or 14 when I left.\u201d In other parts of the state, however, voters encountered spot problems because of poll worker shortages. In Hidalgo County, in southern Texas near the US-Mexico border, the shortages forced some Democratic polling places to close Tuesday. Democratic Party officials also worked \u201cfuriously\u201d to add more Democratic poll workers in Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth, said Rose Clouston, voter protection director for the Texas Democratic Party. She said \u201cnormal human stuff\u201d \u2013 such as illness and car problems \u2013 seemed to contribute to the loss of volunteers. Under longstanding Texas practice, the political parties themselves oversee the primaries on Election Day and are responsible for recruiting election judges and clerks. Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the Texas secretary of state\u2019s office, said his office heard of poll worker shortages in three counties, plus a delayed opening in a fourth county because of issues with electronic pollbooks. This story has been updated Wednesday with additional developments. Rosa Flores contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The most hotly contested statewide primary in Texas on Tuesday centers on the future of state Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Republican who spearheaded a notorious failed legal challenge to the 2020 election results and, with a slew of corruption allegations hanging over his campaign, is now facing the prospect of being pushed into a runoff for the GOP nomination. Recent polling of the race has cast doubt over whether Paxton can win the contest outright, and a chance at a third term in November, in the first primary round. Though he leads the pack, with 47% according to a February survey from the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Politics Project, Paxton needs a majority on Election Day to avoid being drawn into a one-on-one contest with the runner-up in a heavyweight field of potential runners-up that includes state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and US Rep. Louie Gohmert. The campaign has mostly evolved along two tracks: Bush, Guzman and the late-entering Gohmert have sought to chip away at Paxton over his ethics scandals, which include a remarkable episode in 2020 when top lieutenants in his own office leveled allegations of bribery, abuse of office and \u201cother potential criminal offenses\u201d to law enforcement. Paxton has not been charged and has sought to cast the accusations as sour grapes. But his critics and opponents have warned that a potential indictment in the coming months, along with other lingering legal issues, could endanger Republican hopes of another statewide election sweep. Still, as election day nears, and early voting continues, the challengers have ratcheted up attacks on one another, as they jockey for second place. On Thursday night in Austin, the three challengers met for a debate, which Paxton skipped, and Guzman turned her fire on Bush, questioning his integrity, credentials for the state\u2019s top law enforcement job and accused him of lying about her commitment to continuing construction on a border wall. Bush, in response, suggested Guzman was a \u201cgutter politician,\u201d before zeroing in on Paxton. \u201cIf Ken Paxton is nominated again, we lose to the Democrats. We lose to [potential Democratic nominee] Rochelle Garza,\u201d Bush said, targeting concerns over Paxton\u2019s legal issues and how they might hobble him in a general election. Gohmert, who is more ideologically aligned with Paxton and vying for many of the same conservative voters loyal to Donald Trump, sought to downplay the former President\u2019s endorsement of the incumbent and jabbed at Paxton for, he claimed, lobbying Trump. \u201cWhen President Trump called me after I announced, he said, \u2018I was told you were definitely not running.\u2019 Well, I didn\u2019t tell him that,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cBut he said Paxton was calling him constantly asking for the endorsement.\u201d Paxton won reelection in 2018 despite being under indictment for securities fraud going back to 2015. That case remains unresolved and, as Bush alluded to during the debate, there is a possibility Paxton could face more legal trouble before the year is out. Paxton\u2019s absence from the debate on Thursday is in line with a strategy, according to campaign observers, of seeking to side-step scrutiny over his legal issues \u2013 including those stemming from the 2020 letter. \u201cHe says as little about it as he can. When he does speak to it, he claims that the charges are politically motivated or driven by disgruntled former employees who are on the wrong side of office politics,\u201d Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, told CNN. Wilson said Paxton\u2019s claims about his former top aides don\u2019t pass muster, but doubted they would damage him if he were to win the Republican nomination. \u201cThese are not people that can easily be dismissed as RINOs or closet liberals. These are Republican folks who are saying this guy\u2019s just not honest,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt is damaging \u2013 to a degree. It\u2019s why he\u2019s got three primary opponents. But, increasingly, we are in an era where people just don\u2019t care about the ethical improprieties of people on their own side of the political aisle.\u201d In a statement shortly after his formers aides\u2019 allegations were made public in 2020, Paxton described the signatories as \u201crogue employees\u201d and said he would not resign in the face of \u201cfalse allegations.\u201d The letter, which touched off some calls for Paxton to step down, stated: \u201cWe have a good faith belief that the Attorney General is violating federal and/or state law, including prohibitions relating to improper influence, abuse of office, bribery and other potential criminal offenses.\u201d Paxton also claimed to CNN that the accusations against him were intended to obstruct an inquiry into alleged criminal behavior by other officials in his office. Paxton has sought to consolidate the conservative vote in the primary with a series of recent lawsuits \u2013 including one targeting the Biden administration over \u201cits illegal mask mandate for airlines and airports\u201d \u2013 and opinions, most notably one delivered this week, \u201cconcluding that performing certain \u2018sex-change\u2019 procedures on children, and prescribing puberty-blockers to them, is \u2018child abuse\u2019 under Texas law.\u201d Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican also seeking reelection, delivered the same message to state agencies later in the week, a move that, while not changing state law, set off a nationwide backlash from transgender advocates and allies, who have called out the move as part of a broader right-wing drive to demonize transgender youth and lay the groundwork for denying them medical care. Texas AG declares pediatric gender-affirming procedures to be child abuse, legal opinion says Asked about the opinion at the debate, all three candidates onstage said they agreed, but Bush and Gohmert questioned why it was timed just ahead of the final day of early voting on Tuesday. The challengers split, however, when asked by a moderator whether President Joe Biden won the 2020 election. Bush raised his hand to affirm the results. Gohmert kept his down and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he did or not.\u201d Guzman, seeming to waver, offered a more legalistic reply, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s undetermined from my perspective, but yes, I\u2019m raising my hand, he\u2019s our president. \u2026 We need to look at what we do going forward.\u201d Gohmert, who was among the GOP House members to object to the certification of the election, then added that Biden is, in fact, \u201cthe legitimate president.\u201d Paxton, who was one of the speakers to address the pro-Trump crowd in Washington on the morning of January 6, 2021, drew headlines in December 2020 when he filed suit against Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 four battleground states that broke for Biden \u2013 as part of a Trump-backed bid to invalidate millions of ballots and overturn the results of the election. The US Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit, with no public dissents, stating that Texas lacked the standing to file it. But Wilson, the SMU professor, said the failed attempt likely succeeded as a political ploy ahead of the primary. \u201cIt has probably helped him,\u201d Wilson said of Paxton, \u201cin the sense that it has cemented him as the champion of the die-hard Trumpists.\u201d The attorney general\u2019s use of his office to score political points has been a theme of his campaign, said Charles Blain, president of Urban Reform and an Abbott campaign veteran from 2014. Blain and his group have not endorsed any of the primary candidates. \u201cWhat [Paxton] is doing right now is trying to use that office to protect legal interests of Texans and to feed into or appeal to primary voters,\u201d Blain said, ticking off an assortment of recent lawsuits and investigations launched by Paxton. \u201cThese are a lot of things that the primary voters are concerned about and care about, and I think this directly appeals to them. And so I think that\u2019s a unique development in the race, because all of those came within the past, I would say, two-and-a-half to three weeks.\u201d Whether it is enough to secure Paxton the nomination outright on Tuesday remains an open question, though most observers now expect the campaign to go to a runoff that would not be decided until late May. Should he fall short Tuesday, Paxton would still enter the runoff as the favorite. But each of the three challengers \u2013 all well-funded and with clear political bases of support \u2013 pose a threat. Guzman, from her time on the state\u2019s high court, has been a popular figure and, along with Bush, could benefit from signs of a shift among Latino voters in 2020 toward the Republican Party. If elected, Guzman would become the state\u2019s first female and Latina attorney general. Bush stands to benefit \u2013 now and in a potential runoff \u2013 from his family\u2019s history in Texas politics. Former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, his uncle and late grandfather, respectively, helped build a political power base in the state. Despite clashes between his father, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and Trump, the name still carries weight with elements of the party establishment and more moderate GOP voters. Gohmert, too, despite never holding statewide office, has a national political profile and, observers note, could be best positioned to siphon Trump voters away from Paxton. Paxton has knocked Gohmert over his attendance record in Congress. Gohmert responded, in a statement to The Texas Tribune, by describing his missed votes as \u201cprocedural in nature.\u201d \u201cOnce again,\u201d Gohmert added, \u201cKen fails to tell the truth to Texas voters, and his pattern of dishonesty is disqualifying as our state\u2019s top Attorney.\u201d",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump sat down with radio hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton for an extended interview. He talked 2024, Russia and, well, just about everything else. I went through the transcript and pulled out the lines from the former President that you need to see. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cPolitically, I guess, you see the polls, and the polls for me have never been higher.\u201d The question Trump was asked was, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And away we go! 2. \u201cThe polls have been extraordinary: 96% approval rating \u2014 and saw one this morning, 98%, but 96% approval rating \u2014 in the Republican Party and doing well with independents, doing well with women, doing well with everybody.\u201d I can\u2019t find any recent poll where Trump\u2019s approval rating is at 96% among Republicans. That shouldn\u2019t surprise you though. He has been saying his approval rating is 96% \u2013 without any actual polling to back it up \u2013 for years now. 3. \u201cI think that has a lot to do with what\u2019s going on in Ukraine. You look at inflation. You look at all of the different things that are happening so bad for our country. The border. Who could forget the border? Millions of people, not two million or one million, like they say.\u201d This is unedited. He actually said these six sentences one right after another. 4. \u201cMany of these people come from prisons. They\u2019re being let out.\u201d I searched and searched for even a single news story that claimed that other countries were releasing their prisoners so they could come into the United States. I found none. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 5. \u201cBut many of these countries are emptying their prisons like we\u2019re a dumping ground right into our country. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d Again, there is zero evidence for this claim. 6. \u201cYou can take the five worst presidents in the history of our country and put them together; I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve done the damage that this administration has done.\u201d So, um, about the five worst presidents \u2026 well, the thing is \u2026 this is awkward \u2026 7. \u201cWell, what went wrong was a rigged election and what went wrong is a candidate that shouldn\u2019t be there and a man that has no concept of what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Trump was asked what went wrong with Russia and Ukraine. His answer was that the 2020 US election was stolen. Which, uh, what? 8. \u201cI went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, \u2018This is genius.\u2019 Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine \u2014 of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Surely Trump isn\u2019t suggesting Russia\u2019s claim that parts of Ukraine are now their own countries is \u201cgenius,\u201d right? RIGHT?!! 9. \u201cSo, Putin is now saying, \u2018It\u2019s independent,\u2019 a large section of Ukraine. I said, \u2018How smart is that?\u2019 And he\u2019s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper.\u201d Oh, so he was serious. This is the former president of the United States praising an authoritarian ruler as \u201csmart.\u201d It\u2019s hard for me to be shocked by anything Trump does at this point, but this statement is truly shocking. 10. \u201cWe could use that on our southern border. That\u2019s the strongest peace force I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Russia is massing troops at the eastern and northern borders of Ukraine. And Trump is suggesting America should do the same at our southern border. So \u2026 [head explodes]. 11. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who\u2019s very savvy. \u2026 I know him very well. Very, very well.\u201d Again, this is the former President of the United States praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. It\u2019s absolutely nuts \u2013 and deeply irresponsible. 12. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy that says, you know, \u2018I\u2019m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent\u2019 \u2013 he used the word \u2018independent\u2019 \u2013 \u2018and we\u2019re gonna go out and we\u2019re gonna go in and we\u2019re gonna help keep peace.\u2019 You gotta say that\u2019s pretty savvy.\u201d Just heaping praise on potentially the biggest provocation in Europe since World War II \u2026 no biggie. 13. \u201cWell, I\u2019d rather see them send soldiers to our southern border. I\u2019d rather see them \u2026 In three weeks, you could finish it.\u201d This is Trump suggesting, again, that the Biden administration should militarize our southern border. 14. \u201cI knew Putin very well. I got along with him great. He liked me. I liked him. I mean, you know, he\u2019s a tough cookie, got a lot of the great charm and a lot of pride.\u201d He really can\u2019t say enough nice things about Putin. 15. \u201cI think he sees this opportunity. I knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it. I said, \u2018You can\u2019t do it. You\u2019re not gonna do it.\u2019 But I could see that he wanted it.\u201d \u201cBut I could see that he wanted it.\u201d 16. \u201cI think nobody probably knows him better in terms of the discussions that we have or that we\u2019re having this morning. So, I knew him very well.\u201d So, no one in the world knows Putin better than Trump? Whatever you say, man. 17. \u201cSo, when we heard about this, nobody knew anything about it. Nobody had any idea \u2013 other than I said very early on it came, obviously it came from the Wuhan lab, and I took a lot of heat.\u201d A report from the Director of National Intelligence made clear that sources are divided as to whether the virus originated in a market near Wuhan, China or in a lab. 18. \u201cYou know, when you see body bags lying all over the place around the Wuhan lab, it\u2019s not that hard a guess, a guesstimate.\u201d Trump has made this claim before. And, no, there\u2019s no actual evidence to back that up. 19. \u201cSo, I heard about it, and we really mobilized fast, and we made a lot of great decisions.\u201d Here\u2019s Trump in January 2020: \u201cWe have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d 20. \u201cFauci wasn\u2019t a big player in my administration because I made the decisions.\u201d Yeah, this makes sense. You definitely don\u2019t want a highly respected doctor making decisions during the heart of a pandemic. 21. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated machine \u2014 more complicated, believe it or not, than building a car.\u201d Ventilators: \u201cA very complicated machine.\u201d 22. \u201cNow we have so many masks we don\u2019t know what to do with them, and now you\u2019re finding out the masks don\u2019t work that well.\u201d From the CDC: \u201cMasking is a critical public health tool for preventing spread of COVID-19, and it is important to remember that any mask is better than no mask.\u201d 23. \u201cBut there\u2019s so many things that we did that were so good.\u201d Trump\u2019s summation of his handling of Covid-19: There were so many things that we did that were so good.\u201d 24. \u201cAnd everybody wanted the vaccine. And once I was out, all the sudden people didn\u2019t want it.\u201d This is false. There was a massive surge of vaccination in the first few months of President Joe Biden\u2019s term. 25. \u201cSo, but with the more serious, the kids, there was a certain state that lost many people. But, of the many people, thousands of people, but of the thousands of people, nobody, not one person was under the age of 16 or 17.\u201d I literally have no idea. 26. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know what this thing was, don\u2019t forget. Nobody had any idea what this was. We were saying, what is it? So, I think we did a great job.\u201d The idea that the US has no idea what Covid-19 was is a drastic rewriting of history. Trump spent months downplaying the virus, yes. But that\u2019s very different than not knowing what it was and how much of a threat it was to our country. 27. \u201cI do support it, and I have great respect for them and basically their freedoms were being taken away with the mandates and other things that they were talking about very fairly.\u201d This is the former President on the trucker blockade in Canada aimed at protesting Covid-19 vaccine mandates. It\u2019s good to know that \u201cthey were talking about it very fairly.\u201d 28. \u201cBut Canada is very unhappy, and Mexico is very unhappy. You know, in a way, that makes me feel good. In another way, I\u2019d like them to be happy.\u201d \u201cAnd in a way, you\u2019re both winners. \u2026 But in another, more accurate way, Barney is the winner.\u201d 29. \u201cI hope he does great for the country. I think it\u2019s too late because I don\u2019t think he can do great for the country.\u201d So, Trump hopes Biden \u201cdoes great\u201d for the country. But also, it\u2019s too late for him to do great for the country. Yeah, this all checks out. 30. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much damage done that I think if he turned out to be George Washington and Abraham Lincoln combined, I think the net result is so bad, I just don\u2019t think he can do it.\u201d If Joe Biden turned out to be Washington and Lincoln reincarnated, I feel like we\u2019d have a lot more to discuss than just how he is doing as president. 31. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to run, or I don\u2019t think he\u2019s \u2014 you know, he could run and maybe somebody would run against him, and that\u2019s very rare, that something like that would happen. She doesn\u2019t seem to be very popular in the polls. You know, there was the polls of me against him, and I\u2019m leading by a lot.\u201d In the course of just three sentences, Trump says: a) Biden isn\u2019t going to run b) someone could primary him c) Vice President Kamala Harris isn\u2019t very popular and d) he is beating Biden badly in all the polls. Amazing. What a journey. 32. \u201cUsually, you choose somebody that starts off at one and ends up at 15 or 20, you know, going like a rocket ship up. \u2026 So I think she\u2019s gonna certainly put a play in.\u201d Yes, waiter, I\u2019ll have the word salad please. 33. \u201cWhen her shoes fell off, when she couldn\u2019t lift her foot up in, she couldn\u2019t walk, she kept falling down going into the airplanes.\u201d Trump is talking about Hillary Clinton here although it\u2019s not at all clear what, specifically, he is talking about. My best guess is he\u2019s referring to when Clinton stumbled at a 9/11 remembrance ceremony in September 2016. 34. \u201cI will say, though, The Washington Post sort of apologized for their coverage. The Times didn\u2019t.\u201d Neither The Washington Post nor The New York Times has \u201capologized\u201d for their coverage of Trump. But you already knew that. 35. \u201cSo, I think you\u2019ll be happy.  \u2026 Campaign finance laws, so you can\u2019t talk about this stuff, so I won\u2019t. But I think you\u2019ll be happy. I really believe you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d What Trump is effectively saying here is that, yes, he is probably running for president again, but doesn\u2019t want to announce it just yet and run afoul of campaign finance laws. So, there\u2019s that. 36. \u201cTwitter is boring as hell now.\u201d The former President of the United States, ladies and gentlemen! 37. \u201cThey want to get a name, right? You know, they want a name, like \u2018tweet.\u2019 Okay, tweet. They\u2019d like it to be five letters. So they always have an X. You know, put an X in front because \u2013 so they gone through all these crazy names that nobody\u2026\u201d He\u2019s talking about the naming process of his new social media site Truth Social. I think\u2026 38. \u201cTheir minds are blowing because Trump has the name \u2018truth.\u2019 So there\u2019s five letters, and what\u2019s better than \u2018truth?\u2019 Words fail. 39. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna come back, we\u2019re gonna come back strong, we\u2019ll be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Something\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d \u201cSomething\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d \u2013 Trump 40. \u201cI think he\u2019s coming back because I watched the way he \u2026 You know, everyone said he was retiring, but he didn\u2019t sort of say that. I think he might come back and, if you look at statistics, he was leading virtually every category.\u201d Trump thinks Tom Brady is going to come out of retirement! Yeah, this feels like a good place to end.",

            "article_content": "It took only 24 hours for Donald Trump to hail Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s dismembering of independent, democratic, sovereign Ukraine as an act of \u201cgenius.\u201d The former President often accuses his enemies falsely of treason, but his own giddy rush to side with a foreign leader who is proving to be an enemy of the United States and the West is shocking even by Trump\u2019s self-serving standards. As President Joe Biden reprises the fabled presidential role of leading the free world, the predecessor who wants to succeed him is showing Putin that impunity, dictator-coddling and hero worship will return if he wins back the White House. Trump\u2019s remarks on a conservative radio show on Tuesday will not only find a warm welcome in the Kremlin. They also will concern allies standing alongside the US against Russia who fear for NATO\u2019s future if Trump returns. Get up to speed: Russia faces sanctions for 'beginning' invasion Trump also sent an unmistakable message to Republicans, who are already playing into Putin\u2019s hands by branding the current President as weak, that siding with a US foe is the way into the ex-President\u2019s affections ahead of this year\u2019s midterm primaries. Trump didn\u2019t take long to make sure Putin knew he approved of his movement of troops into parts of eastern Ukraine, knowing that his comments would be picked up and beamed around the world. \u201cI went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, \u2018This is genius.\u2019 Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine, of Ukraine, Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Trump said in an interview on \u201cThe Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show.\u201d The ex-President added: \u201cSo Putin is now saying, \u2018It\u2019s independent,\u2019 a large section of Ukraine. I said, \u2018How smart is that?\u2019 And he\u2019s going to go in and be a peacekeeper. That\u2019s the strongest peace force,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe could use that on our southern border. That\u2019s the strongest peace force I\u2019ve ever seen. \u2026 Here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s very savvy. \u2026 I know him very well. Very, very well.\u201d Trump was referring to Putin\u2019s declaration on Monday that he would regard two rebel regions of eastern Ukraine, where he has been fostering separatism, as independent and his order for Russian troops, which Putin misleadingly called \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d forces, to reinforce the enclaves. The move was a flagrant violation of international law, was resonant of the tyrannical territorial aggrandizement of the 1930s that led to World War II and was, as Biden said on Tuesday, tantamount to \u201cthe beginning of a Russian invasion.\u201d In effect, the ex-President is trying to undermine US foreign policy as the current President tries to stop a war that could kill thousands of people and threaten the post-Cold War peace. Blinken says meeting with Lavrov is off after Russia moves on Ukraine But it\u2019s unsurprising Trump would praise anything Putin does, given his genuflecting to the Russian leader while in office. Given that he tried to stage a coup that would have destroyed US democracy, it\u2019s hardly shocking either that he\u2019s not fretting at the loss of Ukrainian freedom. Trump once stood side by side with Putin at a Helsinki summit and trashed US intelligence agencies that said Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election to help him. And Trump tainted Ukrainian democracy himself, seeking to extort President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing an investigation into his then-Democratic rival, Biden \u2013 an abuse of power that earned him the first of his historic two impeachments. In the hierarchy of vital news stories on Tuesday, the ex-President\u2019s boastful ramblings pale in significance to the alarming events in Eastern Europe. But his comments amounted to more than the normal carnival barking and prioritizing of personal obsessions over national interests for which Trump is known. No other living former president would dream of, let alone get away with, lionizing a Russian leader who may soon be waging the biggest war in Europe since World War II after declaring on Monday that Ukraine has no right to exist. It's time to admit it: Mitt Romney was right about Russia But Trump\u2019s status as the likely favorite for the Republican nomination in 2024 \u2013 and the possibility that he could return to power \u2013 takes his latest crowing over Putin\u2019s gangsterism to a new level. He\u2019s sending the promise of future favors and approval of Putin\u2019s illegal land seizures, which suggest he would do little to reverse them as president. Trump\u2019s latest idolization of Putin is likely to widen the growing divide in the GOP between traditional hawks, who have sometimes praised Biden for standing up to the Russian leader, and pro-Trump lawmakers \u2013 and conservative media stars like Tucker Carlson \u2013 who have sided with Putin. Trump\u2019s former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, a possible future Republican presidential candidate, also recently praised Putin, a scourge of democracy, as a \u201cvery talented\u201d and gifted statesman. \u201cHe was a KGB agent for goodness sakes. He knows how to use power. We should respect that,\u201d Pompeo told Fox in January. The fact that this is coming from leading members of the party of ex-President Ronald Reagan, who beseeched then-Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to \u201ctear down this wall\u201d in divided Berlin and was credited with winning the Cold War, represents a startling transformation. And it shows how far the GOP has traveled away from its respect for fundamental US democratic values in the pursuit of power. Some Republicans have been more subtle in their criticism of Biden. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has backed the President\u2019s effort to unite Western allies behind the US in order to confront Putin and is in favor of strong sanctions to punish the Russian leader. But not for the first time on Tuesday, the Kentucky Republican demonstrated that he was ready to play the game at both ends \u2013 accusing Biden of causing the crisis through weakness. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Vladimir Putin would have a couple of hundred thousand troops on the border with Ukraine had we not precipitously withdrawn from Afghanistan last August,\u201d McConnell said in Lexington on Tuesday. \u201cThe impression we have left, first with the abandonment of Afghanistan, is that America is not interested in playing as large a leadership role as we used to.\u201d Biden pledges to use 'every tool at our disposal' to limit gas price hikes after imposing new sanctions on Russia McConnell is tapping into a sentiment shared by many Americans of both parties that the US evacuation from Afghanistan last year was chaotic and poorly planned and hurt perceptions of Biden\u2019s leadership abroad. At the same time, however, Biden\u2019s leadership in this crisis has been more assured. He has, for instance, brought NATO members closer than they have been in many years. The idea that Biden is weak in the face of Putin is sure to play out on the midterm campaign trail all year. But the fact that Republicans are laying such a charge following their complicity in Trump\u2019s obsequious attitude toward Putin is hypocritical and absurd. The House Republican leadership, which is in Trump\u2019s pocket, accused Biden of \u201cappeasement\u201d on Tuesday \u2013 the same day that their de facto leader described Putin as a \u201cgenius.\u201d While the last administration often laid out a firm stance against Russia, it was repeatedly undermined by Trump\u2019s gushing admiration for Putin in public and his habit of making impulsive decisions that played into Russia\u2019s foreign policy goals, including the US withdrawal from northern Syria. Trump lauded Putin in the interview Tuesday as a \u201ctough cookie\u201d who loves his country and he insisted that he had stopped Putin from invading Ukraine on his watch. \u201cI knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it. I said, \u2018You can\u2019t do it. You\u2019re not going to do it.\u2019 But I could see that he wanted it,\u201d the former President said. In reality, Trump suggested during his 2016 campaign that Russia could keep Crimea, another Ukrainian territory which Putin had annexed in 2014. \u201cThe people of Crimea, from what I\u2019ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,\u201d Trump said, parroting a Kremlin talking point. The idea that Trump\u2019s toughness prevented Putin from invading Ukraine is undermined not only by his chummy exchanges with a leader who imprisoned opponents and presides over a country where journalists are often killed. One of the goals of Putin\u2019s pressure on Ukraine \u2013 as he has made repeatedly clear \u2013 is to drive NATO back to its boundaries at the end of the Cold War and to divide the Western alliance. With Trump in power, the Russian leader didn\u2019t need to bother with the latter goal, since his counterpart in the White House frequently berated trans-Atlantic allies and cozied up to US enemies. And it\u2019s not as if Putin let up on America when Trump was in power. Cyberattacks emanating from Russian soil also took place throughout the Trump presidency, including the SolarWinds operation that breached US federal agencies. Supposed respect for the US didn\u2019t stop Russian agents from using a biological weapon on British soil to poison a defector, according to the UK government. There are multiple documented instances of Trump being soft on Putin. And GOP criticisms of Biden as failing to stand up to Putin conveniently forget Trump\u2019s notorious Helsinki news conference, not to mention the multiple strange contacts between his 2016 campaign team and Russian outsiders.",

            "article_content": "The chairman of Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign operation on Tuesday unveiled his vision for the future of the GOP, which was quickly met with a retort from the White House. \u201cI\u2019ll warn you; this plan is not for the faint of heart,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, writes in the introduction to his 11-point plan, which he said he hoped would \u201cstrike fear in the heart of some Republicans.\u201d Push for swift passage of Postal Service overhaul bill hits snag in the Senate Among the most attention-grabbing of his proposals in the memo, which says it was paid for by his campaign and not the NRSC, is completing Donald Trump\u2019s border wall and naming it after the former President, as well as calling for all Americans to pay an income tax \u201ceven if a small amount.\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki seized on the latter proposal, tweeting Tuesday that Scott and \u201cSenate Republicans just released an economic plan that doesn\u2019t include a single proposal to lower prices for the middle class,\u201d and claiming \u201che wants to raise taxes\u201d on Americans, \u201cincluding on seniors and working families.\u201d In the plan, Scott leans into the so-called parental rights messaging that the GOP has adopted in the wake of Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s victory in Virginia last year that had successfully seized on parents\u2019 frustrations with pandemic-related school disruptions. Scott, for example, calls for closing the Department of Education, eliminating teacher tenure at public schools and having all children say the Pledge of Allegiance and stand for the National Anthem. \u201cPublic schools will teach our children to love America because, while not perfect, it is exceptional, it is good, and it is a beacon of freedom in an often-dark world,\u201d the plans states, while repeatedly trying to craft a contrast to what Scott calls \u201cthe woke left\u201d and \u201cwokeness.\u201d The GOP senator, a former governor who could harbor higher political ambitions, also calls for eliminating what he labeled \u201cracial politics\u201d throughout the rest of the country, saying that under GOP leadership, Americans would not be asked to disclose their race, ethnicity or skin color on government forms. Republicans have repeatedly used rising crime to attack Democrats, often misleadingly tying candidates to the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement. Scott strikes a similar chord, calling for full funding for police and increasing penalties for theft and violent crime. Fact check on Sen. Rick Scott's comments blaming inflation on government spending As the GOP did throughout the 2020 cycle, Scott takes aim at socialism, writing that it \u201cwill be treated as a foreign combatant which aims to destroy our prosperity and freedom.\u201d He ties that message into a call for shrinking the federal government, including by reducing the government work force by 25% in five years and selling off government buildings and assets. His call to clean house in Washington, DC, extends to Congress, which he wants to have 12-year limits for lawmakers. He\u2019d like \u201cgovernment bureaucrats\u201d to have the same limits. And despite his call for more Americans to pay an income tax, Scott wants to \u201cimmediately cut the IRS funding and workforce by 50%.\u201d Trump\u2019s misinformation about mail-in ballots and his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him have inspired a raft of efforts in GOP-led states around the country to restrict the right to vote. Scott adopts similar rhetoric about Democrats trying to \u201crig elections,\u201d without providing any evidence, and calls for the end of same-day voter registration and unmanned ballot drop boxes in public areas, as well as for ballot counting to be done \u201cin full public view.\u201d Scott connects his message about parental rights in schools to a familiar broader social message from Republicans about opposing abortion rights, supporting \u201cthe nuclear family\u201d and prohibiting transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender, which an increasing number of GOP-led states have tried to codify at the state level. \u201cWe will reject both the roots and the adherents of cancel culture in America,\u201d Scott writes, echoing language that Trump often uses, including calling for social media platforms that regulate content \u201cto be treated like publishers and subject to legal action.\u201d Scott\u2019s last point \u2013 \u201cWe are Americans, not globalists\u201d \u2013 comes as the Biden administration on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in eastern Ukraine.",

            "article_content": "What happens in the coming hours will decide how bad the Ukraine crisis gets for the vulnerable democracy in Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s sights but also its potentially huge impact on Americans and an already deeply unstable world. Whether Putin stages a full-scale invasion into all of Ukraine or limits his incursion to sending troops to two pro-Moscow regions in the east that he recognized as independent on Monday will dictate the severity of sanctions the US and its allies say will be the most consequential ever imposed on Moscow. US official says Russian troops could move into pro-Moscow regions of Ukraine in the coming hours The question of whether he has ambitions beyond eastern Ukraine also has wider implications. His alarming speech Monday that slammed NATO for disrespecting and threatening Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union could plunge Washington and Moscow back into a new Cold War-style confrontation after 30 years of relative calm in Europe. And developments in the hours and days to come will have massive implications for Americans. A Russian invasion of the rest of Ukraine send already sending the soaring gasoline prices and inflation that have hammered wallets in the US much higher. It would also land another blow against President Joe Biden\u2019s credibility and hand him an intractable challenge with his Democrats already at risk of huge losses in midterm election year. The omens are very, very dark. At the stroke of a pen Monday,  Putin sliced off two more pieces of an independent, sovereign nation to add to his seizure of Crimea in 2014. Moscow said it would send what it called \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d to the regions. Its euphemism notwithstanding, US officials fear that the force could be the vanguard of the full invasion mobilization they have predicted for days. As bad as this flash of gangster geopolitics already is, things could get a lot worse. If Putin were to stop here, it is possible that the Ukraine crisis could be contained, and even give the Russian President an opening to deescalate the situation and desist from a full invasion of the entire country after pocketing new territory in his quest to prevent Ukraine from moving toward the West. Such a step back \u2013 perhaps designed to divide the US from less hawkish allies \u2013 might avoid a wider global crisis. In the US, this interim scenario might also spare Americans a damaging new spike in gasoline prices and inflation and allow Biden to escape another blow to his credibility in a tough midterm election year. Unfortunately, however, the evidence of Putin\u2019s own furious rhetoric on Monday, the presence of up to 190,000 Russian troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders and most assessments of US leaders and intelligence officials suggest hopes for a limited conflict are wishful thinking. In his speech from the Kremlin, Putin made clear that he sees Ukraine as indistinguishable from Russia and not an independent entity \u2013 hardly an argument that suggests restraint. In fact, his screed came across as a justification for a far larger venture than a limited incursion into the east of the country. US ambassador to UN says Putin's claim he's sending 'peacekeepers' into eastern Ukraine is 'nonsense' He referred to Ukraine as \u201can integral part of our own history, culture, spiritual space\u201d and referred to comrades, relatives and people \u201cconnected with us by blood.\u201d \u201cModern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia,\u201d he added. In a United Nations Security Council emergency meeting on Monday evening, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield argued that Russia\u2019s designation of troops it was sending to eastern Ukraine as \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d was \u201cnonsense.\u201d She said the force was an \u201cattempt to create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine.\u201d Putin\u2019s propagandistic view of history did not amount to a declaration of an invasion or an attempt to reunite Ukraine with the Motherland. But it would be easy to read it as an attempt to prepare the Russian people for war. It also surely augured a long-term effort to dominate and destabilize a democracy that includes large numbers of citizens who yearn to join NATO and the European Union. Putin\u2019s most chilling line came when he appeared to lay the groundwork for treating any attack on Russian forces due to enter eastern Ukraine as a pretext for a wider conflict that the US has said could kill thousands of civilians and trigger refugee flows. In eastern Ukraine's Donbas, Putin draws on an old playbook \u201cFrom those who seized and hold power in Kyiv, we demand an immediate cessation of hostilities,\u201d Putin said of a government that, unlike him, was chosen in a free and fair election. \u201cOtherwise, all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine.\u201d Just as ominously, multiple US officials told CNN that they interpreted Putin\u2019s move on the two eastern Ukrainian regions, which call themselves the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (DPR and LPR), as part of a steady march to a wider invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThis is Potemkin politics,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters on Monday. \u201cPresident Putin is accelerating the very conflict that he\u2019s created.\u201d As soon as Putin made his announcement, Biden consulted with the leaders of France and Germany and quickly announced a package of trade and finance sanctions against the two pro-Moscow regions. But he did not immediately roll out the devastating wave of measures against the Russian economy that he has promised in the event of an invasion of Ukraine. US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar on \u201cNew Day\u201d Tuesday that additional sanctions were coming later in the day as part of a \u201cswift and severe response\u201d to Moscow\u2019s actions. The President got himself in some political trouble last month when he suggested that a \u201cminor incursion\u201d into Ukraine would not trigger the full force of the most punitive sanctions ever levied on Moscow. He inadvertently told the truth about divisions at the time between US and European allies over the exact moment when the full sanctions would turn on. Biden later clarified his comment, saying that sanctions would be triggered if \u201cany assembled Russian units\u201d rolled across the Ukrainian border. But again on Monday, administration officials appeared to make a distinction between eastern Ukraine and the rest of the country. \u201cThere have been Russian forces present in these areas\u201d since 2014, a senior official told reporters. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to be looking very closely at what they do over the coming hours and days and our response will be measured, according, again, to their actions,\u201d the official said. Why Donbas is at the heart of the Ukraine crisis It was not clear whether the administration position was due to sequencing issues with allies over sanctions or whether it was seeking to preserve one last-ditch point of potential leverage with Putin. In any case, the Russian leader scoffed at the idea of sanctions in his speech. It is prudent for the US to actually punish Russia for what it does rather than what Putin says. But the semantics over what constitutes an invasion does risk diminishing the action that the Russian President took on Monday. It is well known that what Russia has described as pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine were trained by Russia and took its orders. In effect, Putin took a piece of another country, without giving that state a say in its destiny. This is classic expansionist autocracy using ethnic justifications and false claims that Russians were being persecuted and targeted by genocide \u2013 a playbook shockingly familiar from the horror of the 1930s. The question of what constitutes an invasion of Ukraine may soon be moot anyway. The US has accurately predicted Putin\u2019s move through a pre-invasion checklist in recent days that includes moves in eastern Ukraine. And it may be correct again. The Biden administration, which has largely succeeded in building a united NATO front against Putin in recent weeks, is already facing demands from Capitol Hill for a swifter, harsher response to his land grab \u2013 even from some Democrats. Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that the US needed to put down a flag and to correctly define the pending dispatch of \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d to eastern Ukraine. \u201cThat\u2019s an invasion by any sense of the imagination,\u201d he said, adding that the most consequential sanctions ever against Moscow must immediately follow. Two leading Republican lawmakers laid into the Biden administration. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said for months, setting the trigger for meaningful sanctions to Russian tanks rolling across Ukraine\u2019s border was a dangerous mistake,\u201d said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. Putin moves in eastern Ukraine could be opening phase of possible large-scale invasion, multiple US and western officials say \u201cWe must immediately impose real costs for this blatant act of aggression and flagrant violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Unfortunately, the sanctions previewed by the White House thus far are the definition of impotence,\u201d the two Republicans wrote. US officials said late Monday that they expected Russian troops to start rolling into eastern Ukraine and the two rebel regions within hours. The world will soon thereafter find out whether Putin\u2019s bitter fury on Monday was a precursor of a wider conflagration that would effectively end the post-Cold War era and usher in a new age of tension in Europe. That reality would require a huge rethink of transatlantic security \u2013 including the likely dispatch of thousands of US troops back to bases they left in 1990s and early 2000s. Such deployments would also complicate Washington\u2019s desire to pivot its military might to Asia to wage a burgeoning new Cold War-style conflict against a rising superpower, China. A prolonged geopolitical tussle with Russia would also force US and European policy makers to consider just how far Putin might try to push his effort to rewrite the borders of Europe. \u201cWhat worries me is what happens after Ukraine,\u201d former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on CNN on Monday evening. \u201cWe have got a real crisis on our hands here.\u201d Putin\u2019s argument, for example, that Ukrainians were blood brothers of Russians was especially worrying since it could be applied to other countries that include large numbers of ethnic Russians \u2013 including the Baltic states, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, which were formerly under Soviet rule. Any attempt by Putin to extend his principle there could be hugely dangerous since all are now in NATO and benefit from the alliance\u2019s guarantee of mutual self-defense. The next few days will show how willing Putin is to act upon his words and will begin to answer Clapper\u2019s question. The evidence so far looks ominous.",

            "article_content": "Fiona Hill doesn\u2019t know whether President Joe Biden can lead Western allies to ward off Russia\u2019s threat to Ukraine. But unlike his predecessor, he\u2019s trying. Hill has a special vantage point on this slow-rolling crisis that US officials say could bring war in Europe at any moment. As a White House national security aide, she advised then-President Donald Trump on Russia and Ukraine \u2013 and became a star witness in impeachment proceedings that resulted from his conduct. Now, outside the government as a Brookings Institution senior fellow, she\u2019s among the Russia specialists Biden has consulted as he revives foreign policy priorities shared by every president since World War II except Trump. After Trump derided and weakened the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Biden has rallied NATO on Ukraine\u2019s behalf. After Trump pressured Russia\u2019s beleaguered neighbor for his personal benefit, Biden has steeled Americans for shared sacrifice in defense of Ukraine\u2019s right of self-determination. After Trump deferred to Russian President Vladimir Putin over the US government\u2019s own intelligence agencies, Biden has deployed those agencies\u2019 tradecraft in a multi-pronged transatlantic effort to deter Russian aggression. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get a sharper contrast,\u201d Hill observed in an interview. For the moment, at least, she sees Biden\u2019s approach paying some dividends. As described in her recent memoir, There Is Nothing For You Here, Hill followed an unusual path to becoming one of America\u2019s leading experts on Russia. Raised in a working-class family in Britain, she parlayed academic scholarships into advanced degrees from Harvard and an analyst\u2019s job at the National Intelligence Council beginning in 2006 during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Witnessing Britain\u2019s industrial decline helped her understand the populist appeals Trump rode to the White House. But the celebrity real-estate developer\u2019s handling of foreign policy in the Oval Office \u2013 driven not by expertise or the national interest but by his personal experiences, impulses and interests \u2013 was like nothing Hill or her national security colleagues had ever seen. \u201cThere\u2019s no Team America for Trump,\u201d Hill recalled. \u201cNot once did I see him do anything to put America first. Not once. Not for a single second.\u201d It showed in Trump\u2019s praise for the authoritarian leader of Russia, an American adversary that had boosted his finances as a business executive. It showed in his reluctance to embrace America\u2019s mutual defense commitments to European allies, which for decades have constrained Russian behavior; instead, Trump treated NATO as what Hill called a \u201cprotection racket.\u201d Most notoriously, it showed in Trump\u2019s attempt to squeeze Ukraine\u2019s President for manufactured dirt on Biden to help his 2020 election campaign. He held up American military aid as a political lever as Ukraine faced the long-running Russian military threat that now has the entire world on edge. \u201cAll this did was say to Russia that Ukraine was a playground,\u201d Hill said. At home, Trump softened Republicans\u2019 once-hawkish approach to Russia. Today, the leading Fox News hosts and other conservative voices \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate stooges,\u201d as Hill calls them \u2013 buttress Russian arguments as armed conflict looms. Yet even friendly foreign counterparts found limitations in Trump\u2019s scattershot style, which for Hill evokes the old saw about \u201cplaying chess with a pigeon.\u201d Russia\u2019s bid to upend the post-Cold War security order in Europe, beginning in 2008 with its invasion of Georgia and continuing with its 2014 seizure of Crimea \u2013 requires a steadier negotiating partner. \u201cUltimately Putin wants some kind of deal,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey think Biden is the kind of president who could actually make a deal. Trump never could.\u201d So far, Biden has held NATO allies together in rejecting Russia\u2019s core demands, bolstering their forces in Europe and threatening punishing sanctions even though they guarantee domestic economic blowback. Steeped in decades of bipartisan foreign policy consensus, the Democratic President has also drawn support from top Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who have shunned Trump\u2019s embrace of Putin. That demonstration of resolve has at minimum made Putin stop and think. Biden has warned for weeks that Russia could launch a new invasion of Ukraine at any time. It hasn\u2019t yet. \u201cThey might have thought we were going to crumble, and we didn\u2019t,\u201d said Hill, who became an American citizen twenty years ago. \u201cIt might have deterred a full-scale invasion. Now (Putin) is basically recalibrating, recalculating.\u201d But durable success for Biden and European allies will depend on staying power. Even if Russian tanks don\u2019t roll across the border, Hill envisions an extended \u201cboa constrictor\u201d siege in which Putin applies escalating pressure in hopes of bending Ukraine to Russia\u2019s will. \u201cThe real challenge is keeping everyone together for a considerable period,\u201d Hill concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s going to go on a long time.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s intelligence chief is defending the department\u2019s recently released national terrorism bulletin in public comments and memos this week in an attempt to push back against Republican criticism that the Biden administration is attempting to police political thought. The bulletin, released earlier this month, includes concerns about the connection between violent extremism and the spread of \u201cfalse or misleading narratives\u201d related to election fraud and Covid-19. These politically fraught topics sparked Republican backlash against the department, including a letter to the Homeland Security secretary calling for revisions to the bulletin. On Thursday, a workforce message sent on behalf of John Cohen, who leads the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, said the bulletin provided \u201ctransparency on the threat environment to all Americans,\u201d along with guidance and resources to prevent terrorism. The message also linked to Cohen\u2019s remarks earlier this week, in which he said it is \u201d irresponsible\u201d to suggest that DHS or the Biden administration are attempting to investigate people because of their political beliefs. The intelligence behind the bulletin, Cohen added, had been shared with members of Congress. \u201cSo for public figures, particularly those that know better, and know the reality of the threat environment, to suggest that somehow the department or the administration is simply trying to open the door to investigate people because of their political beliefs, or people who are involved in Constitutionally protected speech, I mean, quite frankly, it\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d Cohen said Tuesday in a discussion hosted by the George Washington University Program on Extremism linked to in his memo. \u201cAnd it may also contribute to the volatility of the threat environment.\u201d A similar message was also shared with state and local partners outside of DHS on Friday, according to a source familiar with the notification. On February 7, DHS had updated its National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin \u2013 one of the primary mechanisms DHS uses to inform the public about potential terrorist threats. In part, it warned that the convergence of violent extremist ideologies, false or misleading narratives, and conspiracy theories \u201chave and will continue to contribute to a heightened threat of violence in the United States.\u201d For example, the bulletin cites: narratives regarding \u201cunsubstantiated widespread election fraud and COVID-19.\u201d \u201cGrievances associated with these themes inspired violent extremist attacks during 2021,\u201d it says. On Tuesday, Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, sent a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urging the department to update the bulletin. \u201cI am concerned about the appearance of the Department of Homeland Security policing the speech, thoughts, and opinions of American citizens,\u201d she wrote, adding that DHS \u201cappears to endorse particular narratives regarding controversial issues that are at the center of our national political conversation.\u201d She also wrote, \u201cthe Department comes dangerously close to suggesting that publicly disagreeing with the current administration is akin to domestic terrorism.\u201d Former President Donald Trump accused the Biden administration of doing \u201canything to keep the eye away from the massive irregularities and voter fraud that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election\u201d and calling on DHS to instead focus on the border. For years, Trump has embraced conspiracy theories about voter fraud, CNN has previously reported, along with fact-checks debunking the former President\u2019s claims on this issue. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also spoke out against the bulletin. \u201cNew bulletin states if DHS thinks you post \u201cmisleading narratives and conspiracy theories,\u201d or \u201cmis-dis- and mal-information\u201d on topics like COVID-19 you will be labeled a domestic terrorist. Will I be next? Will you? This should frighten every American,\u201d Johnson tweeted. When asked about the recent criticism during the GW panel discussion, Cohen said, \u201cOur job is not to police thought. Our job is to prevent acts of violence. We do not monitor individuals as they are involved in constitutionally protected speech.\u201d His comments and the memo are an effort to refute allegations that the bulletin contained a political motive. \u201c[A]nyone who suggests that this NTAS reflects a strategy of this administration and this department to target for investigation, individuals, simply because of their political or other beliefs, either didn\u2019t read the NTAS, didn\u2019t understand it or is intentionally misrepresenting it,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "When Vice President Kamala Harris enters the famed Hotel Bayerischer Hof on Friday in Munich, she\u2019ll do so under the largest international gaze of her career. She leads the American delegation to the Munich Security Conference on Friday as Russia creeps closer to mounting what US officials have warned would be a devastating and costly invasion into Ukraine. President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday he believed an attack could begin \u201cin the next several days,\u201d just hours after Harris departed. And during a tense United Nations Security Council meeting the same day, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia was laying the groundwork to justify starting a war and preparing to launch an attack on Ukraine. The rapidly intensifying stakes make Harris\u2019 trip to the annual gathering all the more important, allies say. She will find herself in the centers of the action, under pressure to perform the tasks of an American diplomat at this heightened moment while allies and foes alike closely analyze every word she says and every meeting she takes, trying to assess the US posture. Still, she won\u2019t be entirely on her own \u2013 Blinken, who has been one of Biden\u2019s closest aides for more than a decade, will be attending the conference, too. His presence there will be a useful backstop in case anything goes awry, one US official noted, because \u2013 unlike Harris \u2013he is a known entity to the dozens of world leaders and diplomats who will be in Munich throughout the weekend. Biden: 'Every indication' is that Russia will attack Ukraine 'within the next several days' \u201cThe goal of the Munich Security Conference will be for our NATO allies to speak in one voice in support of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, sovereignty. And that leading voice will be Vice President Harris,\u201d Halie Soifer, a former national security adviser to then- Sen. Harris, told CNN in an interview on Thursday. \u201cShe has a critically important role to play, especially at this time of crisis for the world.\u201d But any misstep could carry outsized implications, not only for Harris\u2019 political future but also the international community writ large. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen in the next few days. It\u2019s completely conceivable that we could see Russia begin an invasion anytime.\u201d said Charles Kupchan, the senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council under former President Barack Obama. \u201cPart of the vice president\u2019s mission is to show up.\u201d For Harris, a senior administration official described her key objective in Munich as three-pronged: Focus on the \u201cfast-changing\u201d situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression. During her first bilateral meeting of the trip with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Harris made sure to sent that message. \u201cWe remain, of course, open to and desire diplomacy as it relates to the dialogue and the discussions we\u2019ve had with Russia. But we are also committed \u2013 if Russia takes aggressive action \u2013 to ensuring there will be severe consequences in terms of the economic sanctions we have discussed,\u201d Harris said. She added, \u201cI am here to ensure that through our discussions, and the discussions I will have with other of our allies, that we continue as these hours and days progress to stay in close contact. We understand this is a dynamic moment in time. So the work we are doing on a daily basis and sometimes on an hourly basis to strengthen the relationship, to check in, in terms of our strategic imperative, is critically important and it\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here.\u201d Harris will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while at the conference, her first meeting with the Ukrainian leader, as well as give a keynote speech on Saturday. The vice president will maintain a \u201cvery intense\u201d schedule when she is in Munich, senior administration officials said. The meeting with Zelensky will be one of several high-level meetings she\u2019ll hold. \u201cI think that this is an important opportunity for her, where she can play a role that a vice president is uniquely able to play and that is to make a visible presentation of the ideals of administration,\u201d Joel Goldstein, a vice presidential historian, told CNN in an interview on Thursday. Kupchan referred to the Munich conference as the \u201cDavos,\u201d of international security, a nod to the famed World Economic Forum in Switzerland that draws the upper echelon on foreign leaders. \u201cThe advantages are not just symbolic (for Harris). It\u2019s also a great platform. Her speech will be covered globally,\u201d Kupchan told CNN in an interview on Thursday. \u201cThe Munich Security Conference affords what you might call \u2018one-stop\u2019 shopping in the sense that the key players will be there.\u201d On Friday, Harris met with Stoltenberg and held a multilateral meeting with the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. She also held a separate meeting with US congressional leaders who are attending the conference. Biden called in to that meeting, according to a person in the room, and reiterated the work the US and allies have been doing to try to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine. He also updated the members on the situation at Ukraine\u2019s borders. And on Saturday, Harris will deliver her keynote speech. She\u2019s expected to focus on addressing the situation on Ukraine\u2019s border, the threat of Russian aggression and the latest state of play, per senior administration officials. She\u2019ll likely tout the unity among US allies that the administration says they\u2019ve maintained, as well as make the case that any invasion will leave Russia weaker while reassuring allies of the US\u2019 commitment to NATO and partners broadly. After her speech, she\u2019s expected to meet with Zelensky and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the margins of the conference, the senior administration official added, in addition to other foreign leaders who were not immediately named. While Harris\u2019 attendance can be seen, allies say, as a clear sign of the trust Biden has placed in his vice president, Kupchan said it also signifies the importance Biden places in the conference. \u201cBiden is an Atlanticist. His concern about the transatlantic relationship and European security is in his DNA. And he\u2019s been working on these issues for decades,\u201d Kupchan told CNN. \u201cTransatlantic solidarity has continued when it comes to Russia right through the Trump era, which speaks to the stickiness of the relationship, because Trump tested it. And I think that Vice President Harris\u2019 trip to Munich is an investment in ensuring that that solidarity continues.\u201d Still, with grave warnings growing grimmer by the day from US officials, there\u2019s a distinct possibility that Russia could invade Ukraine while Harris remains on foreign soil. New estimates from US officials provided Thursday would place the number of Russian forces north of the 150,000 figure Biden cited in a televised address earlier this week, despite Russian claims of withdrawal. If Russia does attack while the conference is ongoing, Kupchan said, \u201cThe conversation then becomes much more urgent.\u201d \u201cObviously, the vice president and her delegation would need to maintain closer contact with Washington because, you know, developments would be emerging on a minute-by-minute basis. But her message and her task doesn\u2019t really change, in the sense that so much of the homework has already been completed,\u201d Kupchan added. The vice president\u2019s foray into Western Europe will serve as her fifth trip abroad during her tenure. Her performance on the international stage has not been spotless, with moments amplified by the right and criticized from the left over her \u201cdo not come\u201d message to migrants looking to come north to the US\u2019 southern border during her first trip to Guatemala and Mexico. A subsequent trip to Southeast Asia, though Harris\u2019 individual performance raised no issues, was overshadowed by the tumultuous fallout of the US\u2019 bungled withdrawal from Afghanistan, leaving Harris to project competence in a moment of doubt from allies. Subsequent trips to Paris and Honduras, though months apart, brought the vice president praise for completing both trips gaffe-free. Goldstein views Harris\u2019 current high stakes trip as the next step. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a progression of her vice presidency,\u201d Goldstein told CNN in an interview. \u201cVice presidents have taken on important missions in the past, and I think this is certainly the most significant mission yet of her vice presidency.\u201d Harris' trip to Paris signals a relationship back on track At the start of her tenure, those close to Harris told CNN that foreign policy and national security were key areas she wants to develop in her portfolio. Harris\u2019 foreign policy experience is less than her recent predecessors as she had only been working in Washington for four years before taking this new job. Harris began private lunches with Blinken \u2013 ones that White House official say still continue \u2013 and the pair share a good relationship, speaking frequently. Harris has also spent much of the Biden administration\u2019s first year in power meeting with dozens of foreign leaders who come to the White House. Allies say Harris\u2019 trip to Munich fits well into her wheelhouse because of her work as a freshman on the high-profile Senate Intelligence Committee. Soifer, an adviser for Harris at the time, said she played a leading role on the committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cShe got a crash course in terms of (Russian President) Vladimir Putin\u2019s intentions and his strategy. While much of that experience was acquired behind the scenes, it did provide deep experience in terms of the threats that the United States and the global world order face from Russia in this moment,\u201d Soifer said. Biden has flexed his decades of experience in dealing with international matters during the latest spike of Russian-Ukrainian tensions, specifically the years he spent as the US frontman on the issue during his last stint in the White House. While aware he cannot read Putin\u2019s mind, Biden has spent long stretches trying to explain the enigmatic Russian leader to his aides, according to people present for the conversations. Those conversations have likely served as a valuable resource to Harris in her preparations for this critical trip. Biden tries to chart a new path on the US-Mexico border, but similar roadblocks remain \u201cI think the best preparation that she can possibly do, which I know she is doing, is her frequent conversations and meetings with President Biden,\u201d Soifer told CNN. Soifer added that Harris is a thorough and meticulous preparer for moments like this. \u201cTheir conversations about this crisis will inform her approach in Munich. She is there speaking for the President and having spoken with him so many times in the lead up to this conference, it\u2019s clear that she is representing his views and those of the administration,\u201d she said. The senior administration official told reporters that Harris and Biden have been repeatedly engaging with each other on the issue. Biden has attended this conference on multiple occasions, both when he was vice president and as a senator. \u201cThe vice president and the President see each other often, multiple times a day. They are closely engaged on every aspect of the governing agenda,\u201d the senior official said, noting Harris\u2019 attendance at the President\u2019s daily intelligence briefings in the Oval Office \u201cmultiple times a week,\u201d and at a range of other meetings on Russia and Ukraine, while at the President\u2019s side.",

            "article_content": "Russian government-backed hackers have acquired sensitive information on the development and deployment of US weapons by breaching American defense contractors over the last two years, US security agencies said in a public advisory on Wednesday. The information gathered is unclassified, but offers \u201csignificant insight into US weapons platforms development and deployment timelines,\u201d and also covers export-controlled technology, according to the FBI, National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). It\u2019s one of the clearest public statements yet from the US government on how Kremlin-linked hackers have gathered intelligence on US defense contractors \u2014 a problem Washington has faced for years. The intrusions hit contractors supporting every US military branch, including the Air Force, Army, Navy and Space Force, as well as firms that work on defense and intelligence programs, US officials said. Blinken says US has seen 'no meaningful pullback' of Russian forces from the Ukraine border The advisory comes as US officials warn Russia against further invading Ukraine, along whose border Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops, according to US President Joe Biden. US government agencies have for years regularly released information on state-sponsored hacking threats, and US officials continue to say there is no credible, specific cyber threat to the US homeland tied to the Ukraine crisis. Contractors targeted by Russian hackers over the last two years have been involved in aircraft design and the development of combat and weapons systems, among other things, the US agencies said. \u201cBy acquiring proprietary internal documents and email communications, adversaries may be able to adjust their own military plans and priorities, hasten technological development efforts, inform foreign policymakers of US intentions, and target potential sources for recruitment,\u201d the advisory says. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the US advisory. Russia routinely denies allegations that it conducts hacking operations. \u201cBoth the United States and Russia are continually probing, through cyber, to pick up information on weapons systems, on intelligence, etc.,\u201d Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Wednesday when asked about the new US advisory. \u201cThe compromise of intelligence information is [on] both sides,\u201d said Reed, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re very well prepared with our cyber operations to assist the Ukrainians.\u201d US Navy aircraft had an 'extremely close' encounter with multiple Russian military jets over the Mediterranean Reed said that the US generally has a \u201cvery active cyber operation against Russia. That was demonstrated \u2026 before the 2020 elections, when we literally took out some Russian sites who we knew were interfering with our election.\u201d President Joe Biden said at a January 19 news conference that the US could respond with hacking operations of its own to further Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine. US officials have been publicly and privately advising US critical infrastructure firms for weeks to check their networks for potential Russian hacking threats. Reed said that US Cyber Command, the military\u2019s hacking and cyber defense unit, \u201cis on full alert\u201d in the event of any escalation from Russia in cyberspace. US spy agencies have long used cyber tools to collect intelligence on rival powers such as Russia and China. The US National Security Agency looked for ways to exploit products made by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, The New York Times reported in 2014, citing classified documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. This story has been updated with additional details Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "Many Americans are puzzled at being dragged into a 1970s-style Cold War showdown with Russia. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden tried to explain why the crisis matters. After building a strong Western coalition to try to deter Russia\u2019s possible invasion of Ukraine, Biden needed to prepare the home front for the hardships that may come for Americans, including soaring energy prices, if Russian President Vladimir Putin goes ahead. He did so in a grave White House address Tuesday that \u2013 while it may have been necessary for domestic political reasons \u2013 might also have risked a new escalation in US tensions with the Kremlin since Biden signaled no quarter on Putin\u2019s core demands. The world remains on tenterhooks for Putin\u2019s next move, even after Moscow said it pulled back some troops in a possible sign of flexibility. Biden said the US had not yet detected such a movement on the ground. The President\u2019s speech was directed at multiple audiences \u2013 Putin himself, Russian citizens with whom he said the US had no quarrel, Ukrainians and US allies in Europe. But the President took pains to ensure the American people heard a clear message too. This was important for protecting his domestic flank. While Republican leaders have been generally supportive of the President\u2019s approach, there are clear signs that the GOP is laying the ground to pounce if the situation worsens. While stressing he would not send troops to Ukraine, Biden told Americans that everything that their country stood for \u2013 freedom, democracy and the right of sovereign nations to decide their destinies \u2013 would be risked by caving to Russia. He argued that American national security depended now, as it had done for decades past, on resolute defense in Europe to prevent any Russian moves on US allies beyond Ukraine. For much of the Cold War this was an accepted plank of bipartisan foreign policy. But given US exhaustion with two decades of 21st century war abroad and the America First unilateralism, attacks on NATO and hero worship of autocrats of the Donald Trump era, it can no longer be assumed this is a default US position. \u201c(If) we do not stand for freedom, where it is at risk today, we\u2019ll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow. Thank you. I\u2019ll keep you informed,\u201d Biden said, before turning on his heel at the end of a crisp 11-minute speech to camera. There was a strong impression that Biden, whose staff had been seeking a window for such an address, according to CNN sources, hoped to rebuild a reputation for candor and competence dented by his last big foreign policy crisis \u2013 the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer. He also hedged against yet more incoming political damage when he warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could destabilize world energy markets and Americans will not escape consequences. This is why it was so important for Biden to explain to American voters that he did not welcome the confrontation and wanted to still offer Putin an off-ramp. \u201cI will not pretend this will be painless,\u201d the President said. \u201cThere could be impact on our energy prices. \u2026 We\u2019re prepared to deploy all the tools and authority at our disposal to provide relief at the gas pump. And I\u2019ll work with Congress on additional measures to help protect consumers and address the impact of prices at the pump.\u201d Perceptions of Biden\u2019s presidency and the rebounding economy as the pandemic eases have already been gutted by high gasoline prices and the largest hikes in inflation for basic goods in 40 years. He can ill afford another economic blow only nine months before elections in which Republicans have high hopes of taking back the House of Representatives and the Senate, throttling his domestic presidency. And the risks of a blowback from Russian action are acute, as Putin \u2013 who has shown a flair for playing domestic US politics with his election meddling and would enjoy wounding Biden politically \u2013 surely understands. For example, a new analysis by RSM shared with CNN found that if the current crisis drives oil to $110 a barrel, inflation in the US would top 10% on a year-on-year basis. That backdrop underscores why Biden\u2019s political position is treacherous as he navigates the crisis and why a speech like Tuesday\u2019s was necessary for political reasons, even if it risked complicating the diplomatic gambit. While there is no sign that Biden is willing to appease the Russians, he has little political room in Washington for any concessions. Some Republicans are playing the game on both sides \u2013 showing solidarity against Russia while leaving room to capitalize on the situation and brand the President weak if things go poorly. Others, especially those who swore fealty to Trump, care little for national unity at a time of crisis. This duality in the GOP response was laid bare in a statement in which senior Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations, Intelligence and Armed Services committees signed onto a statement with top Democrats on the crisis. \u201cIn this dark hour, we are sending a bipartisan message of solidarity and resolve to the people of Ukraine, and an equally clear warning to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin,\u201d said the message, bearing the names of Republican Sens. Jim Risch of Idaho, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Marco Rubio of Florida and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But McConnell also told reporters that the crisis was partly Biden\u2019s fault. \u201cBut for the catastrophe in Afghanistan, there\u2019s not a doubt in my mind \u2013 not a doubt in my mind \u2013 that the Russians wouldn\u2019t be on the border of Ukraine with 100,000 or more troops, had we not indicated to the rest of the world we were pulling the plug on Afghanistan and going home,\u201d McConnell told reporters. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Republican who rose to a leadership position in the House because of her staunch support for Trump, lashed out a Biden as she joined a push by GOP lawmakers for their version of punishing sanctions that would target Putin and his associates even before an invasion of Ukraine. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s slow support for Ukraine and weakness on the world stage has emboldened Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression against the sovereign and democratic state of Ukraine,\u201d Stefanik said in a statement. Beyond the political undercurrent, it was rather chilling to hear a US president make such stark assurances to allies about support in the face of Russian aggression. Biden almost cast a time-warp back to the 1980s, a decade when his worldview was sketched as a globetrotting US senator during the Cold War and his adversary, Putin, was forged into a strongman by his years in the KGB \u2013 the Soviet Union\u2019s feared state security service and espionage agency. \u201cMake no mistake, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,\u201d Biden warned. \u201cAn attack against one NATO country is an attack against all of us and the United States commitment to Article Five is sacrosanct.\u201d Article Five has only been invoked once \u2013 by America\u2019s allies after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Biden\u2019s promise to defend NATO members, including those that joined after leaving the Warsaw Pact after the Soviet Union fell, was a reminder of how tense things could get if Putin invades Ukraine. In that scenario, Russian forces would come closer to NATO troops in nations that border the country, like Hungary, Poland and Romania. That is a situation fraught with possibilities for miscalculations and would considerably worsen tensions in Europe. Still, while Biden\u2019s frankness was jarring, the speech should also be seen in the context of a propaganda mind game the US has been playing with Putin as it seeks to set the pace in the crisis and remove his element of surprise. Blowback against Americans would not just be at the gas pump if relations with Moscow deteriorate further in the event of a Ukraine invasion. The kind of fearsome sanctions that the US and its allies would impose would cause a Russian counter reaction. Moscow has the capacity to disrupt foreign policy in multiple areas that Washington cares about, including on issues vital to US national security like curtailing Iranian and North Korean nuclear and missile threats. And Putin is likely to be even less responsive to US demands to stop cyber-hacks on American soil if his regime is pulverized by its sanctions. All of this points to the real political consequences that Biden would face in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. In his speech, he offered broad security talks with Moscow, consultations on transparency and strategic stability. But the fact that Biden cannot both preserve NATO and cede to Putin\u2019s core demands \u2013 an alliance withdrawal from former Soviet allied states in eastern Europe \u2013 shows that there may be no diplomatic solution to be had unless the Russian President is willing to settle for something less far reaching. \u201cThe reality of the matter, what Putin wants, is something we cannot give him through diplomacy. He wants to control Ukraine, he wants to, in many ways, reset the European security order that was agreed to after the Cold War,\u201d Ivo Daalder, a former US ambassador to NATO, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday. \u201cIt seems to me he wants to threaten us into unilateral surrender and Biden went out today and said it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Daalder said.",

            "article_content": "On Fox shows, people who are opposed to the ongoing Canadian protests against vaccination mandates, Covid-19 restrictions and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have been portrayed as elites out of touch with the views of everyday workers. Batya Ungar-Sargon, deputy opinion editor of Newsweek, tweeted on Monday: \u201cDon\u2019t let the fact that the mainstream media is hiding this fool you: Canadians support the Freedom Convoy.\u201d In fact, poll after poll \u2013 including the very poll Ungar-Sargon was referencing \u2013 has shown that most Canadians oppose the protests and support both vaccination mandates and various restrictions intended to limit the spread of the virus. The polling figures suggest it is Fox\u2019s cheerleading for the protests that is out of touch with the views of a significant majority of the Canadian public. In addition, one of the recent Canadian polls has been falsely described this week in some pockets of conservative media. While that poll did show that there is considerable Canadian discontent with Trudeau\u2019s handling of the protests, it\u2019s not true that only 16% of Canadians said they want Trudeau back as prime minister, as a Fox contributor claimed, or that only 16% would vote for Trudeau again, as the right-wing Washington Examiner reported. Here\u2019s an explanation of how the \u201c16 percent\u201d figure is being misused \u2013 followed by a look at some of the actual findings of four February polls of Canadian adults. The Washington Examiner reported Sunday that a new poll \u201cshowed that only 16% of Canadians would vote again for Trudeau as prime minister.\u201d Fox contributor Tammy Bruce made a similar claim on television on Monday: \u201cSixteen percent would want him back as the prime minister. So that tells you about where people are and how they\u2019re viewing this.\u201d But both the Examiner and Bruce were wrong. The poll they were citing, conducted by Maru Public Opinion, did not even ask people if they would support Trudeau in another election or wanted him back as prime minister. Rather, the poll tried to gauge how people\u2019s support for Trudeau was being affected by his handling of the protests. It asked respondents this rather confusing question: \u201cDo you think Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made you want to vote for him because of how he has dealt with the situation?\u201d Sixteen percent of poll respondents answered yes, as Ungar-Sargon of Newsweek \u2013 the formerly prominent newsmagazine that now, under different ownership, bears little resemblance to its 20th century incarnation \u2013 correctly noted in her Monday tweet. But that 16% clearly does not represent the entirety of the support for Trudeau. A voter who definitely intends to vote for Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party in the next election could have answered no to this question if they were unhappy that Trudeau hadn\u2019t taken a harder line in trying to end the protests. And a voter who is considering voting Liberal for some other reason, say tax policy or housing policy, could have answered no to the question on the grounds that they don\u2019t plan to cast their vote \u201cbecause of\u201d anything related to the protests. In other words, these results are difficult to conclusively interpret. But it\u2019s plain inaccurate to claim the poll showed that only 16% of Canadians want Trudeau back or would vote for Trudeau. (Side note: Canadians vote for a local Member of Parliament, not directly for prime minister, though the party leaders are the central figures in each national campaign.) With that said, Trudeau critics can fairly cite other recent poll findings that have been poor for the prime minister. For example, 48% of respondents in the same Maru poll said Trudeau has demonstrated he is not up to the job of prime minister, while an Angus Reid Institute poll found that about 65% said Trudeau had made the protest situation worse. But that doesn\u2019t mean Trudeau is toast in Canada\u2019s multi-party parliamentary system, especially because there is no election imminent. In the federal election in September, Trudeau\u2019s Liberals won the most parliamentary seats, though not a majority, with the support of 32.6% of voters. Also, February polling clearly shows that discontent with Trudeau\u2019s approach to the protests does not equate to support for the protests. Angus Reid Institute poll: More than two-thirds strongly oppose the protesters\u2019 approach and behavior In the Angus Reid Institute survey, conducted from February 11 to 13, 69% of respondents said they opposed the protesters themselves \u2013 their approach and behavior \u2013 versus just 27% who said they were supportive of the protesters. Sixty-four percent of respondents said they opposed the protesters\u2019 demand to end all pandemic restrictions, versus 33% who said they were supportive. In addition, 72% said the protesters have made their point and should \u201cgo home now,\u201d while 22% said the protesters should \u201cstay in Ottawa and other protest sites until their demands are met.\u201d And while 24% of respondents said the protests have made them less supportive vaccine requirements for international travel and crossing the US border \u2013 the protests were sparked in part by a new vaccine requirement for truckers who cross from the US \u2013 44% said the protests had actually made them more supportive of these vaccination requirements, while 32% the protests had no real effect. The survey was conducted online \u201camong a representative randomized sample of 1,622 Canadian adults who are members of Angus Reid Forum.\u201d Leger poll: Nearly two-thirds think the protesters are a selfish minority In a Leger survey conducted from February 4 to 6 in collaboration with The Canadian Press news agency, 62% of respondents said they opposed the protests\u2019 message of no vaccine mandates and fewer public health measures versus 32% who supported that message. Sixty-five percent of respondents agreed with the following statement: \u201cThe convoy is a small minority of Canadians who are selfishly thinking only about themselves and not the thousands of Canadians who are suffering through delayed surgeries and postponed treatments because of the ongoing pandemic.\u201d The online survey of 1,546 Canadian adults used a representative sample \u201cselected from LEO\u2019s (Leger Opinion) representative panel.\u201d Ipsos poll: Strong majority disagrees with the goals of the protests In a survey conducted by Ipsos from February 8 to 9 on behalf of Global News, 59% of respondents agreed with this statement: \u201cThe truck protest is mostly a group of anti-vaxxers and bigots intent on causing mayhem and they should not be allowed to protest.\u201d Forty-one percent disagreed. When respondents were asked if they agreed that \u201cwhile I might not say it publicly, I agree with a lot of what the truck protestors are fighting for,\u201d 63% disagreed and 37% agreed. The poll did find that 46% of respondents agreed that while they may not agree with everything the protesters in the capital of Ottawa have said, \u201ctheir frustration is legitimate and worthy of our sympathy.\u201d Still, even on this question, 54% said that what these protesters have said and done \u201cis wrong and does not deserve any of our sympathy.\u201d The online survey was conducted among a sample of 1,000 Canadian adults. The poll used quotas and weighting to ensure that the sample reflected the Canadian population. Maru Public Opinion poll: Nearly two-thirds favor military support role in ending the protests In the survey conducted by Maru Public Opinion from February 9 to 10, 56% of respondents said they don\u2019t agree with the protesting truckers in \u201cany way, shape or form\u201d and that everything possible should be done to end the protests. Just 20% of respondents said they \u201cfully\u201d support the protesting truckers, while another 24% said they support the reasons for the protest but \u201cnot the way they are going about it.\u201d Sixty-four percent agreed with the statement that \u201cCanada\u2019s democracy is being threatened by a group of protesters and they must be stopped immediately.\u201d Sixty-four percent also supported using the Canadian military in a support role to tow protesters\u2019 trucks. And as Ungar-Sargon acknowledged in a subsequent tweet on Monday, in which she conceded at least that there isn\u2019t \u201cblanket support\u201d for the protests, 58% said drivers who refuse to follow law enforcement directives to move should \u201cface fines and potential jail terms of up to two years.\u201d The online survey was conducted among a random selection of 1,523 Canadian adults who are \u201cMaru Voice Canada panelists\u201d and weighted by education, age, gender, and region to match the Canadian population.",

            "article_content": "The US believes Russian intelligence agencies have worked closely with the editorial staff of five Russian-language media outlets to boost public support for a renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine, US officials familiar with the intelligence assessment told CNN in a media briefing. Officers with Russia\u2019s domestic and foreign intelligence agencies, the FSB and SVR, have covertly planted articles in publications that blame the West for tensions with Russia over Ukraine, question the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government and challenge the US commitment to its European allies, US officials alleged. A pillar of the alleged propaganda scheme is the Strategic Culture Foundation, a Russian journal that the US Treasury Department sanctioned last April for spreading disinformation in the 2020 US election, officials said. The US officials did not present the underlying intelligence the allegations were based on, and they declined to describe how the information was obtained. Some of the information is corroborated by open-source reporting. How the Biden administration is aggressively releasing intelligence in an attempt to deter Russia The disclosure is part of a furious effort by the Biden administration to declassify intelligence in the hope of preempting Russian military action in Ukraine, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials have said could happen at any time. Russia has massed an estimated 130,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s border, according to two sources familiar with recent assessments. The disinformation campaign \u201cis a primary vector for how the Russian government will bolster support domestically for an invasion into Ukraine, as well as spread any disinformation on a false flag operation,\u201d a US official authorized to speak on background with the media told CNN. Neither the Strategic Culture Foundation nor the Russian Embassy in Washington responded to a request for comment. Russia has previously denied US allegations that the Kremlin was spreading misinformation. The declassified US assessment reflects the views of agencies across the government and of US allies, officials said, and it illuminates how US spy agencies view the intermingling of Russian publishers and intelligence operatives. US officials allege that Vladimir Maximenko, the head of the Strategic Culture Foundation, has met in person with his SVR handlers and that publications controlled by Maximenko \u2013 known as Fondsk and Odna Rodyna \u2013 have been spreading disinformation on Ukraine. Neither Fondsk nor Odna Rodyna responded to a request for comment. Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence agency, meanwhile, pulls the strings on media outlets known as News Front, Antifaschst and Politnavigator, according to US intelligence. The coordination is so close that known FSB officers tell the journals when to publish articles and when to delete certain content, according to US officials. The West is a player in the Ukraine information war. Unlike Russia, it has to convince the public The US Treasury sanctioned Crimea-based News Front last year for spreading disinformation. In addition to Russian, the outlet publishes in English, Polish and other languages in an effort to reach a wide audience. News Front is led by Konstantin Knyrik, who has been active for years in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. US officials allege that senior FSB officers have praised Knyrik for spreading misinformation in Ukraine. News Front did not respond to a request for comment on the US allegations against Knyrik. Biden administration officials have aggressively sought to out alleged Russian machinations in Ukraine in recent weeks, including by speaking publicly about alleged Russian plans to make a video, replete with actors and corpses, depicting a fake attack on Russia as a pretext for invading Ukraine. \u201cThe costs of inaction at this moment likely offset any risk\u201d for the US intelligence community in disclosing intelligence on Russian activities in Ukraine, said Gavin Wilde, a former National Security Council official focused on Russia. \u201cThe Biden administration is creating all the friction it can, and I think that\u2019s a positive development that I hope carries forward,\u201d Wilde, who is now a managing consultant at Krebs Stamos Group, told CNN.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kevin Cramer had just arrived at the US Capitol on Monday night when he found Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate. His message to the GOP leader: Avoid a messy confirmation fight for President Joe Biden\u2019s first Supreme Court pick. McConnell agreed. \u201cHe was already there,\u201d Cramer said, recalling the episode. And the North Dakota Republican added: \u201cLet\u2019s not change the momentum of this midterm election because we aren\u2019t going to change the makeup of the court. Why spend a lot of time on that hill?\u201d As they gear up for a battle, GOP leaders are counseling their members to take a measured approach. Their advice: Vet the nominee thoroughly, make your point about her record \u2013 and avoid personal and blistering attacks, especially given that the nominee almost certainly won\u2019t change the ideological balance of the court. The truth about diversity on the Supreme Court Moreover, Republicans are growing more bullish by the day about their chances in the midterm elections and are worried that going too hard at a Black female nominee \u2013 the first in history \u2013 could turn off middle-of-the-road voters just as they\u2019re trying to get them to focus on the country\u2019s economic challenges. \u201cWe think it\u2019s not probably the kind of event that\u2019s going to drive people to the polls,\u201d Minority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told CNN of the confirmation fight. \u201cWe think that the people that are going to determine who the majority is in the House and the Senate in \u201922 are going to be looking at issues like the economy and inflation and the border and crime in cities and things like that.\u201d While the GOP strategy won\u2019t be hashed out until Biden makes his pick, Thune\u2019s comments are a remarkable acknowledgment of how top Republicans view the shifting political dynamics over the court \u2013 after the last two presidential elections were fought bitterly over Supreme Court vacancies. And even as they\u2019re eager to move onto the crises the administration is dealing with at home and abroad, they have a clear challenge: Many in their party want to mount a major battle over the vacancy. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said the GOP needs to prove to voters \u201cthat the Senate matters.\u201d And going further than many in his leadership, Hawley faults Biden for saying he wants to select a Supreme Court nominee who is a Black woman, even as he downplayed former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s promise to name a woman to the court in 1980 as \u201cancient history.\u201d Luj\u00e1n will return to Senate in 4-6 weeks 'barring any complications' after stroke \u201cI think it shows the President\u2019s commitment to these kind of things is based entirely on what\u2019s advantageous to him at the moment,\u201d Hawley said Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s great to have somebody nominated based on quota.\u201d Hawley\u2019s comments have been echoed by a number of conservatives, including allies of leadership, such as Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who suggested the eventual nominee would be the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of affirmative action policies, and Sen. Ted Cruz, who said it was \u201coffensive\u201d Biden would say he\u2019s nominating a Black woman. \u201cYou know, you know Black women are what, 6% of the US population? He\u2019s saying to 94% of Americans, \u2018I don\u2019t give a damn about you, you are ineligible,\u2019 \u201d the Texas Republican said. Behind closed doors, McConnell met this week with Republicans on the Judiciary Committee to hash out their strategy. The message was clear: Avoid a process like the 2018 battle that led to the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who denied accusations of sexual assault during emotional and bitter proceedings. Fact Check: Biden is not the first president to limit SCOTUS search to specific demographics \u201cI think you\u2019re not going to find Republicans getting in the gutter like the Democrats did with Kavanaugh,\u201d Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the committee, said as he left the meeting. While many Republicans won\u2019t go as far as Cruz, several told CNN they disagree with Biden announcing he plans to name a Black woman rather than judging the nominee squarely on her credentials \u2013 even as both Reagan and then-President Donald Trump said they\u2019d name a female justice while on the campaign trail. \u201cThat limits their ability to be identified clearly as the best possible candidate,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds, another South Dakota Republican. \u201cAnd then it restricts, and other people think well, they\u2019re being nominated only because of that, and not because of their competencies.\u201d Asked about Biden\u2019s plans to nominate a Black woman, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said Thursday: \u201cI would prefer no litmus test. That sounds like a litmus test to me.\u201d How Schumer explains his Senate dilemma Yet other Republicans are more open to Biden\u2019s approach \u2013 and are leery making an issue out of race. \u201cI\u2019d love to vote to put the first Black woman on the court,\u201d said Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of leadership, while adding that the nominee\u2019s \u201cjudicial philosophy\u201d would ultimately be a defining criteria. \u201cIf you were the Biden administration, there are so many things going on right now that you would love to change the topic,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t allow the Supreme Court nomination process to change the topic.\u201d While some members are already assailing the President\u2019s process for picking a nominee, others are getting involved. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee and who backed then-President Barack Obama\u2019s two Supreme Court nominees, has signaled he would likely support the potential nomination of Michelle Childs, a South Carolina district judge, for the post. He told reporters he informed the White House counsel this week that the judge would get Republican votes if she did well at a confirmation hearing. Graham met Wednesday with House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina, a leading advocate on Capitol Hill for Childs\u2019 potential nomination, and fellow South Carolina GOP Sen. Tim Scott, where he said they also brought up Childs\u2019 credentials. Scott has spoken positively about Childs. \u201cEvery senator is a kingdom to themselves,\u201d Graham said when asked if he was concerned about the various messages coming from the GOP. Republican Sen. Graham heaps praise on fellow South Carolinian and potential Supreme Court nominee J. Michelle Childs Childs is one of a number of potential nominees on Biden\u2019s short list, as he looks to make his pick by the end of the month. With a 50-seat minority in the Senate and a simple majority needed to confirm nominees, there is still little Republicans could do to block the nomination. For their part, they could withhold a quorum from a committee vote by boycotting the proceeding, but several Republican sources have signaled that strategy would be unlikely and risky. Other than that, the only other opportunity would be to find a Democrat to defect and vote against Biden\u2019s pick while holding the line on Republican votes \u2013 something that seems unlikely given the positive comments from Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia about moving ahead with the nomination. \u201cIt all depends on who President Biden nominates, and if he nominates a radical, and somebody who\u2019s gonna be another politician wearing black robes, then I think there will be a knockdown, drag-out fight,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, a member of GOP leadership who sits on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cIf he nominates somebody who\u2019s a mainstream judge, and then I think it will be, it will not be.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Recently, ex-President Donald Trump proudly declared, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Russia and Ukraine would never have happened under the Trump administration. Not even a possibility!\u201d That may actually be true. After all, just a couple of years ago, Trump was impeached for trying to use Ukraine to dig up dirt on his potential presidential rival Joe Biden. He tried to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate Biden and his son, Hunter \u2013 all while holding up almost $400 million in crucial military aid. Remember that \u201cperfect\u201d phone call? So, yeah, given Trump\u2019s predilection to hug Russia and blackmail Ukraine \u2013 a fledgling democracy \u2013 it\u2019s probably a good bet that Russian President Vladimir Putin wouldn\u2019t be pulling these particular tricks right now. I mean, Trump was his guy. When Bill O\u2019Reilly pointed out to Trump that Putin was a killer, he demurred. \u201cThere are a lot of killers,\u201d Trump said. \u201d \u2026 You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d You'll never guess the 1 world power that thinks less of the US post-Trump All of which brings us to the current state of affairs, and a puzzling conundrum for Trumpist Republicans. After four years of silently watching \u2013 or supporting \u2013 Trump complimenting the Russian President (tweeting, \u201cI always knew he was very smart!\u201d), and dissing US intelligence agencies on issues like Russian election interference (\u201cPresident Putin says it\u2019s not Russia. I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be.\u201d), what are they to do now that Russia has 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border? Fearless leader Trump has predictably done little more than blast Biden\u2019s so-called \u201cweakness\u201d (still an all-time favorite word). But what about suggesting an actual way to deal with Putin\u2019s aggression? Nada. So the party that was once defined by its strong anti-Russian stance is caught between a Trump and a hard place: the more traditional anti-Putin hawks (who, post-Trump, have somehow found their sea legs again) vs. the still-practicing Trumpist isolationists (with some fanaticism thrown in). Lately, it\u2019s hard to avoid the Tucker Carlson wing of the GOP, as he publicly wonders, why take Ukraine\u2019s side over Putin\u2019s side? As Republican Rep. Michael Turner of Ohio told him on Fox, \u201cWe\u2019re on the side of democracy.\u201d But never mind. And how about this? Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has woven a tale that Biden apparently wants war because Ukraine \u201chas the dirt on Hunter Biden.\u201d Oh, and on the President himself. No proof, of course. Sad to say, the GOP created this distasteful stew, and now the party is stuck with it. So what to do? \u201cThe Republicans I work with are barely even commenting on this stuff. They ignore them,\u201d says a Senate Democrat involved in foreign policy. \u201cThe folks who spent the last four years in the thrall of Trump are struggling how to reset as a party,\u201d he adds. \u2018Those who are unwilling are in full isolationist mode.\u201d McConnell plots GOP midterm strategy amid Trump's primary influence For those who choose to remain in Trump\u2019s thrall, it\u2019s easy. Stick with it and see where it gets you. Just take the policy-free route and complain about Biden\u2019s weakness. It\u2019s probably going to work in GOP primaries: A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll found that just 6% of Republicans trust Biden to negotiate with Putin. Three-quarters of Democrats had faith in his abilities. But for the more serious others looking for long-term solutions for the GOP and the nation, it\u2019s not easy to turn the proverbial battleship around \u2013 particularly when the powerful ship\u2019s captain may run for the presidency again. The Senate could vote on sanctions on Russia soon, and some Republicans will support the administration\u2019s actions. Even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said Biden is moving in the \u201cright direction.\u201d Others, including Trump, no doubt will blame Biden for not being tough enough. How about this idea? \u201cRepublicans ought to stand to protect Ukraine from Putin,\u201d says GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. \u201cEncourage Biden to take strong action.\u201d Voters, Newhouse adds, \u201cwant to know if the President has stood up to Putin and shown a stiff spine.\u201d Post-Trump, maybe it\u2019s hard for some Republicans to get back to basics on foreign policy. Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally, told me he can see this internal GOP friction playing out: those Republicans \u201cstruggling to determine what\u2019s the best path forward at a moment when Russian aggression is further strengthening NATO vs. those whose isolationism and leanings towards Russia are distracting\u201d those more aligned with the traditions of the GOP. No doubt Putin \u2013 and American allies \u2013 are wondering who will win the tug of war. And the whole world is watching.",

            "article_content": "When President Joe Biden visits Pittsburgh on Friday, it will amount to the unofficial launch of a new strategy the President devised to shore up his political fortunes by changing how he spends his time. Never mind that Biden has already held eight events in Pennsylvania since taking office, that Pittsburgh was the city in which he both began and ended his campaign or that trips highlighting manufacturing have been a staple of the past year. In this reset, what\u2019s old is new. Snow-covered bridge collapses in Pittsburgh Biden\u2019s return to the Steel City for an event discussing supply chains, manufacturing and his recently passed infrastructure law comes a week after he declared from the White House a desire to \u201cget out of this place more often\u201d and \u201cgo out and talk to the public.\u201d On Friday morning, hours ahead of his arrival, a snow-covered bridge in Pittsburgh collapsed. Under his new plan, the President will be spending less time wrangling centrist Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema and Arizona, and more time jetting to places where he can highlight his achievements to ordinary Americans. He hopes this will boost Democrats ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections. But, for all the discussion inside and outside the West Wing of a tactical reset, events over the past week have shown that external forces will have more bearing on his trajectory than anything his staff can conceive of in a memo. A series of developments this week \u2013 all politically advantageous \u2013 provided a window into the challenges and opportunities facing a White House trying to dig out of a political hole by shifting Biden\u2019s public image. Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s decision to retire from the Supreme Court created a rare political bright-spot for Biden, who has promised to nominate a Black woman to fill the vacancy. There have been signs that ongoing diplomacy with Russia over its build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border may be working, though any optimism at an easing of tensions within the White House is highly guarded. And a wintertime surge of Covid-19 cases has begun to ease in many parts of the country, leading to cautious hope that the worst of the Omicron wave is over. White House officials see the very real possibility over the course of the next several months that the pervasive pandemic will start to dissipate, inflation will start to decelerate and stalled legislative priorities will find pathways forward. Under that rosy, but not unthinkable, scenario, the sour mood that has pervaded the country could begin to lift. But there are clear limits to what Biden can personally do to ensure any, or all, of those things occur as planned. And previous efforts to translate positive developments into political capital have fallen short. That has led to some soul-searching moments in the Oval Office. Advisers and others familiar with the discussions said Biden has wondered aloud why majorities of Americans say the economy is doing poorly when the numbers show otherwise. Eventually, those questions about whether his message was landing were replaced by Biden explicitly telling his advisers he knows it\u2019s not \u2013 and asking for ways to address the shortcoming. It was also Biden who told advisers that they could no longer tiptoe around the issue of rising prices that his economic team long predicted would be merely temporary, the sources said. That led to a messaging shift, with Biden repeatedly and explicitly acknowledging of the difficulty for working families posed by inflation sitting at a nearly four-decade high. Since then, however, little the President has said or done appears to have convinced Americans that what he is doing is working to improve the economy and the overall condition of the country. It\u2019s something White House officials have seen in black and white through their own internal polling, according to people familiar with the surveys, but a deeper thread of concern has drawn more attention in recent months: A growing level of exhaustion and resigned indifference. The trend has concerned Biden\u2019s aides, who have struggled to find a way to break through. It\u2019s a less-than-ideal environment to deliver a message of any kind if nobody is tuned in to hear it, one White House official explained. Yet that\u2019s precisely what Biden\u2019s team is attempting to do in the new year, aware of the high stakes of looming midterms and the short window to shift public opinion before November. How Biden\u2019s new strategy of traveling the country will differ from his previous approach remains to be seen. Because of the pandemic, Biden has been limited in the types of events he can hold. But his team is mulling different ways to present his message to the American people in 2022. Biden is not the first president to determine, at a low ebb, that his problem lies in not communicating directly with the American people. As vice president during the Obama administration, Biden was a loud advocate for better explaining the accomplishments he believed were being lost on the public. 'It's not just his fault': Biden voters look for the President to ease nation's woes Entering his second year in office, the President sought out ideas from his team on how to break through. Their ideas have ranged from traveling more often, delivering fewer speeches from behind a podium, embracing a less rigid approach to social media and engaging in more casual settings with ordinary Americans. The latter idea seemed to get a try-out this week when Biden visited a small local shop to browse onesies for his grandson. The President engaged the shop\u2019s owner in a warm conversation about her inventory and trade, embracing his knack for generating small talk with nearly anyone. But if aides had hoped to use the visit to promote his administration\u2019s work bolstering small businesses or spurring the economy, they may have been disappointed. Biden generated headlines instead with his answers about the simmering crisis between Russia and Ukraine. It was a repeat of a the week prior, when Biden sought to highlight the kind of private sector move that would be a dream to any administration: Intel committing $20 billion in new chip manufacturing in Ohio. \u201cAs a result of the progress we\u2019ve made \u2013 record economic growth, record job growth, a faster economic recovery than any other nation on Earth,\u201d Biden, flanked by Intel\u2019s CEO Patrick Gelsinger, said. \u201cWe are better positioned globally than we have been in a long, long time.\u201d But as the event concluded, Biden looked over to reporters sitting a few feet away. \u201cYou guys will ask me all about Russia and not about anything having to do with chips,\u201d Biden said. Friday\u2019s trip will mark the ninth time Biden has traveled to Pennsylvania for an official event since taking office. He\u2019s been in the commonwealth for personal reasons as well, hopping over the border from his home in Delaware to visit his sister and attend a wedding. Pennsylvania is a prime pickup opportunity for Senate Democrats, adding pressure to the Senate primary fight He\u2019ll visit a former steel mill that\u2019s been converted by Carnegie Mellon University into a hub for advanced technologies. It\u2019s a venue he also visited during the 2020 campaign. Pennsylvania is Biden\u2019s top-visited state outside of Delaware and the Washington region \u2013 not necessarily a surprise given the closely contested elections that will occur there in November. Biden\u2019s stops there over the past year have reflected a specific approach to selling his economic agenda. On previous visits, Biden could be found touring a Mack Trucks facility in the Lehigh Valley, a flooring company in Chester, a carpenters training facility in Pittsburgh and marking Amtrak\u2019s 50th anniversary at Philadelphia\u2019s 30th Street Station. However, on Friday\u2019s trip Biden won\u2019t be joined by some high-profile Democrats, whose distance from the President during a moment of political weakness makes for an inauspicious start to the new strategy. Lt. Governor John Fetterman, who is running for Senate, and Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who is running for governor, both cited scheduling reasons for not attending Biden\u2019s event. \u201cIt\u2019s great that President Biden is coming to Pittsburgh to talk about infrastructure. If infrastructure is Elvis, then Pittsburgh is Graceland,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to come to the city that helped build America to talk about rebuilding America. I\u2019ll be in Harrisburg on Friday meeting with Democrats from across the commonwealth at State Committee and talking about the 2022 midterm election.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden has been in office for just over a year, but former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has seen enough: She wants him to resign. \u201cHonestly, for the good of our country, if Biden loved our country, he would step down and take [Vice President] Kamala [Harris] with him,\u201d Haley told conservative pundit Guy Benson on Thursday. \u201cBecause the foreign policy situation is beyond dangerous at this point.\u201d Um, what? Haley, who served as the UN ambassador during the Trump administration, has every right to raise questions about how Biden has handled foreign policy \u2013 in particular the Russian buildup of troops on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border. But it\u2019s a little more than rich \u2013 and over the line \u2013 for Haley to suggest that Biden\u2019s policies are so bad that they are badly endangering Americans, and that the only thing he can do is step down. It\u2019s particularly galling when you consider how the man Haley served under handled foreign policy. Remember that Donald Trump told North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un \u2013 via tweet! \u2013 that \u201cI too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d And that during a joint news conference with Vladimir Putin, Trump sided with the Russian leader over his own intelligence services when it came to Russian meddling in the 2016 election. So, yeah. Last time I checked, Haley didn\u2019t call on Trump to resign \u201cfor the good of the country\u201d when either of those things happened. What\u2019s going on here is simple: Haley wants to run for president \u2013 if not in 2024, then at some point in the not-too-distant future. (She has already said she will not run if Trump seeks the office again.) In order to best position herself for that bid, Haley is aggressively courting the Trumpists who compose much of the Republican base at the moment. And the best way to do that is to say outlandish stuff \u2013 like that Biden, if he loved the country, should step aside. The more outlandish, the better. The Point: Here\u2019s how you know the Republican marketplace of ideas is corrupted: Haley\u2019s comments about Biden will win her followers  \u2013 maybe lots of them.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has been relentless in his attacks against Senate Minority Mitch McConnell, making Republicans uneasy as they battle for the majority in the November midterms. But McConnell doesn\u2019t see his clash with the former President emerging as much of an issue \u2013 at least not yet. In an interview with CNN, the GOP leader noted that he and Trump are on the same page in backing the same candidate in two of the hottest Senate races \u2013 Nevada and Georgia. He has stayed neutral in Alabama where Trump endorsed a primary contender. And the Kentucky Republican believes that no matter which GOP candidate emerges from intraparty battles in Pennsylvania, North Carolina or Ohio, his party will be well-positioned to hold the GOP seats there. Only in Alaska, where Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski is fighting to hang onto her seat after voting to convict Trump for inciting the January 6 attack on the Capitol, are McConnell and Trump at sharp odds, though that seat is almost certain to stay in GOP hands. And in Missouri, McConnell is closely watching the primary to determine if he needs to engage his super PAC to try to knock off a potentially weak general election candidate \u2013 with many in the party nervous over former Gov. Eric Greitens \u2013 though Trump has not yet endorsed anyone there. But one issue continues to percolate over the party: Whether the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, a lie that Trump continues to peddle and which a growing number of GOP candidates are embracing to curry favor with the former President. McConnell had a warning of sorts to Republican candidates running on Trump\u2019s false claims. \u201cIt\u2019s important for candidates to remember we need to respect the results of our democratic process unless the court system demonstrates that some significant fraud occurred that would change the outcome,\u201d McConnell said. The delicate dance underscores the stakes for the 2022 midterm elections. While Republicans have the most favorable environment in years, buoyed by President Joe Biden\u2019s sinking approval ratings, historical trends and voter anxiety over Covid-19 and the economy, the GOP knows full well that battle for control of the Senate remains on a knife\u2019s edge \u2013 and that any single factor could upend a majority-making race. And that single factor most certainly could be Trump. \u201cI still say it\u2019s 50-50,\u201d McConnell said, assessing the GOP chances to take back the Senate. Comparing Biden\u2019s first midterm election to then-President Barack Obama\u2019s in 2010, McConnell recalled that the Senate GOP at the time \u201cnominated some unelectable candidates.\u201d But he noted that Republicans only had 40 seats at the beginning of that cycle, compared to 50 now. \u201cIt took us six years to climb out of that hole,\u201d McConnell said of 2010. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a hole now.\u201d \u201cI think from an atmospheric point of view it\u2019s highly likely to be a situation where the wind is at our backs,\u201d he added. Yet Democrats say McConnell has issues of his own making. He rallied Republicans in opposition to Democratic efforts to overhaul election laws, in an attempt to beat back restrictive actions taken by GOP-led states, and he even bungled remarks last week when talking about turnout among Black voters, forcing a senator with a penchant for staying furiously on message to clarify his statements amid a stinging backlash over his comments. Asked about any concerns that his handling of the voting issue could turn off minorities in the midterms, McConnell shot back, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just as likely to be a liability for Democrats as it is for us,\u201d citing support for voter ID laws, for example. Try it out: Use our tool to explore past voting data and discover trends \u201cI think I can pretty confidently say, we won\u2019t lose any elections over that issue, anywhere in the country,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cPeople are concerned about a wholly different set of concerns. Inflation, an out-of-control border, Afghanistan withdrawal, the controversy over covid. I mean, the thought that a single Senate race in America would be decided over that issue strikes me as being wildly out of touch with what the American people are interested in.\u201d Other potential clashes with Trump could still yet occur. McConnell is still pining for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey \u2013 whom Trump continues to rail on for certifying Biden\u2019s 2020 victory there \u2013 to run against freshman Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly. And he has courted Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan \u2013 who has long been sharply critical of the former President \u2013 to run against Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat. Ducey continues to publicly say he\u2019s not interested in running, while Hogan has yet to express serious interest in a Senate bid. McConnell said, \u201cI just don\u2019t know\u201d if they\u2019ll mount campaigns. \u201cWell, they\u2019d both be ideal candidates, for obvious reasons,\u201d McConnell said of Hogan and Ducey. \u201cBoth enjoy high approval ratings, and I think would make both those races instantly competitive.\u201d But in a blow to McConnell last year, another Republican governor bowed out, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, despite heavy lobbying by the GOP leader and other senators, a development he called \u201cdisappointing.\u201d In the interview, McConnell singled out another candidate, Chuck Morse, the state Senate president who plans to jump into the race to take on Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in the fall. Here's why a top GOP recruit didn't want any part of the Senate \u201cWe think New Hampshire is going to be much more receptive to Republicans as well, and we think we\u2019ll have a good candidate there,\u201d McConnell said. Yet just last week Sununu gave the GOP another headache, telling the Washington Examiner that he was informed by multiple GOP senators that a Republican majority would be nothing more than a \u201croadblock\u201d to Biden in the next two years, a chief reason why he passed on the bid. Biden cited Sununu\u2019s comments to rail on Republicans at his press conference last week. And McConnell refused to tell reporters last week what the GOP agenda would be if his party were to take back the Senate, saying instead the election will be a referendum on Biden. Asked why Senate Republicans didn\u2019t have an election-year agenda, McConnell told CNN: \u201cI think it\u2019s important for every candidate running next year to say what he or she is for.\u201d Citing his support for the infrastructure law, a measure to bolster US competitiveness with China and new efforts to overhaul a 19th-century law governing how Congress counts states\u2019 electoral votes, McConnell said: \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the guiding philosophy if we have divided government for the last few years in the President\u2019s term to try to look for things we can agree on, and work on those.\u201d The six Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 are currently held by three Democrats in Nevada, Georgia and Arizona and three Republicans in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden narrowly won five of those states in 2020 and lost the sixth, North Carolina, by about a point. Yet another state is on McConnell\u2019s radar: Missouri. That\u2019s because Greitens, the former governor, is running for Senate after resigning in disgrace in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct and blackmail. (Greitens admitted to an extramarital affair but denied any attempt at blackmail.) The fear: Greitens will emerge victorious in a crowded primary only to be rejected by more middle-of-the-road voters in a general election, giving Democrats an improbable win in a red state \u2013 much the way Democrat Claire McCaskill won over the late Republican Todd Akin a decade ago. Greitens has aligned himself with Trump in the primary, attacking the integrity of the 2020 election, and calling for the Senate GOP to oust McConnell from his leadership position. \u201cMissouri is potentially challenging depending on the outcome in the primary,\u201d McConnell said candidly, without identifying Greitens by name. McConnell would not say if his well-funded super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, would oppose Greitens and spend money in the primary if he further separates himself from the pack of other GOP candidates, including Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, attorney Mark McCloskey and Reps. Vicky Hartzler and Billy Long. \u201cAll I\u2019ll say about Missouri at this point is we\u2019re keeping our eye on it,\u201d McConnell said. For McConnell, there have been two potential clashes with Trump that worked themselves out \u2013 in Georgia and Pennsylvania. After Trump quickly got behind former NFL star Herschel Walker, a former Georgia Bulldog running back, to run in Georgia \u2013 many Republicans were anxious, nervous about damaging allegations from his past, including threatening violence against his ex-wife. But Walker\u2019s ability to raise cash and put together a solid campaign team, seemed to win over McConnell, who now backs the former football star and sees the race against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock as neck-and-neck. Walker\u2019s campaign says he\u2019s \u201cdedicating his life\u201d to helping individuals struggling with mental health. \u201cI looked into Herschel Walker\u2019s record \u2013 I\u2019m entirely comfortable with him,\u201d McConnell said when asked about the candidate\u2019s past. \u201cWe believe he starts his race dead even, pretty unusual against the incumbent anywhere in the country. And I think when you see his finance report, it\u2019ll be impressive as well.\u201d 'This crowd is so big and unknown': Pennsylvania Senate scramble could include Dr. Oz and former Bush official One potential intraparty problem \u2013 Trump\u2019s endorsement of Army veteran Sean Parnell in Pennsylvania \u2013 became void when the Senate GOP candidate suspended his campaign after a judge awarded Parnell\u2019s estranged wife primary custody of the couple\u2019s children after she accused him of spousal and child abuse, allegations he denied. Now a bunch of Republican candidates, including celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz, real estate developer Jeff Bartos, former hedge fund executive David McCormick and former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands and others are fighting to be the front-runner in the open race. \u201cIn terms of Pennsylvania, I think we have an embarrassment of riches,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cMaybe riches literally given the amount of money being spent up there.\u201d In Alaska, the situation is different, McConnell notes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be all in Alaska helping Lisa, and that\u2019s one place where the former President and I have a disagreement,\u201d he said, noting that the National Republican Senatorial Committee and his super PAC would be prepared to help Murkowski if necessary. Murkowski has come under fire because of her vote to convict Trump for inciting the January 6 insurrection. Among the foes she\u2019s facing is a Trump-backed Republican, Kelly Tshibaka, who told CNN last year: \u201cWe don\u2019t know the outcome of the 2020 election.\u201d In December, the former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner said that she wouldn\u2019t support McConnell as GOP leader if she won. Trump then blasted out Tshibaka\u2019s statement on his website. \u201cPeople in Alaska have to decide whether that\u2019s a terribly relevant issue to them,\u201d said McConnell, who endured Trump\u2019s wrath last year after pointedly blaming the former President for the Capitol Hill riot attack despite having voted to acquit him in his impeachment trial. A number of Senate GOP candidates across the country have followed Trump\u2019s lead in trying to sow doubt about Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Missouri\u2019s Long and Hartzler, North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd and Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks all voted not to certify two key states that Biden won. Trump has rewarded Brooks and Budd with his endorsement. In Ohio, former state treasurer Josh Mandel and businessman Bernie Moreno said that it was \u201cstolen\u201d from Trump, while former Ohio Republican party chairwoman Jane Timken said \u201cwidespread fraud\u201d was \u201cswept under the bus\u201d and investment banker Mike Gibbons said he doesn\u2019t know what happened. In Arizona, Blake Masters, a protege of tech billionaire Peter Thiel, said he thinks Trump won and solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon has sued to challenge Trump\u2019s loss. Some of the candidates \u2013 Lamon, Moreno and Long \u2013 are echoing the false claim that the election was rigged in their latest advertising. While McConnell suggested that candidates embrace the truth about the elections, he avoided directly criticizing candidates who have promoted the conspiracy \u2013 and wouldn\u2019t address Brooks\u2019 role in firing up the crowd at the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally hours before the Capitol attack on January 6. \u201cI think the voters of these states are going to make these decisions, as well they should, and I think every state in America will accurately count the votes and certify who won,\u201d he said when asked about Brooks. But these Senate Republican candidates could very well become members of McConnell\u2019s conference, which the veteran Kentuckian will once again try to lead in the next Congress spanning 2023-2024. If his GOP colleagues elect him again, McConnell will be the longest-serving Senate party leader in history. Asked if he would attempt to stay on as leader through the end of his Senate term, which ends in January 2027, McConnell wouldn\u2019t say. \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna be running again (for leader) in November,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what happens later.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden is confronting a series of distinct but interlocking global crises and hotspots with US foes lining up to test the mettle of an under-pressure leader and their own sense that the United States is a retreating global power. Biden made the kind of fateful decision on Monday that might be more at home in the tense 1970s, putting up to 8,500 troops on alert to rush to Eastern Europe to counter the Kremlin\u2019s move to force the US away from its Western flank. But his trial of nerves with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is holding Ukraine hostage in a bid to reverse the West\u2019s expansion after the Cold War, is far from his only global headache. On the other side of the globe, a strategic ballet of military might is playing out as the US and China maneuver armadas and warplanes amid tensions over Taiwan, and other disputed territories, in a long-term duel for dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. While the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is fixating the world right now, a future Chinese strike against the self-governing democratic island is the more likely trigger for a disastrous superpower conflict. US places up to 8,500 troops on alert for possible deployment to Eastern Europe amid Russia tensions Then there is the Middle East, from which America has been trying to extricate itself for years. US forces at a base in Abu Dhabi leapt into action early Monday, using Patriot missiles to shoot down several missiles flung at the Gulf emirate by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The emergency was a reminder that despite some hopes of renewed nuclear talks with Iran, the Islamic Republic\u2019s regional power plays are a grave risk to US personnel. And the vicious war in Yemen, prosecuted by Washington ally Saudi Arabia with terrible civilian consequences, endangers the US by association. And if Washington was tempted to forget the frightening prospect of a nuclear North Korea, its leader Kim Jong Un has other ideas. One of a string of recent missile tests by Pyongyang triggered extraordinary ground stops at some US West Coast airports, which underscored the nightmare scenario for any US President that the extreme hermit state could have the US mainland in its sights. Each of these challenges concern foreign states and nationalistic leaders making hard-eyed decisions to advance strategic goals, seeking to increase their power, expand or cement anti-democratic political systems and dominate their spheres of influence outside their own sovereign territory. They also know that with the US under pressure elsewhere, they may have an opening. Putin, for example, is well aware that Biden wants to pivot to the China threat \u2013 so it makes sense to probe to see whether the US is distracted. Beijing, for one, would be happy for the US to get bogged down in Europe. The US probably needs China to help cool North Korea\u2019s provocations. And Russia is a key player in the Iran nuclear talks. It didn\u2019t go unnoticed in Washington that Iran, Russia and China held a third set of naval drills in the Indian Ocean last week. Since the US is, still, the world\u2019s dominant power, with allies across the globe, and the leader of the democratic bloc of nations, each thrust by one of its adversaries draws it deeper into a confrontation and preventive diplomacy. The building challenges to US authority come at a moment when there is a widespread perception abroad that Washington is not the power it was for the second half of the 20th century. Despite Biden\u2019s assurances that \u201cAmerica is Back,\u201d the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last year raised questions about US competence and commitment. US adversaries know Americans are exhausted by 20 years of war abroad, a factor that may lead some to calculate that Washington could waver on its strategic obligations for political reasons. Biden caught on hot mic calling Fox reporter 'a stupid son of a bitch' And foreign leaders understand domestic US politics too. With a significant percentage of the country convinced Biden is illegitimate thanks to former President Donald Trump\u2019s election lies, and Republicans lambasting him as weak under Putin\u2019s challenge, there\u2019s rarely been a better time for foreign nations to test a modern President\u2019s character and stamina. The possibility that Trump, who was a four-year force for global instability, could return to office, meanwhile, has some allies doubting that the US can keep any commitments it does make. Some foreign leaders might look at events in Washington on Monday and wonder whether the stress is beginning to weigh on the President. After a White House event, Biden was asked about inflation by a Fox reporter and in a stunningly unguarded moment on an open mic, he responded: \u201cWhat a stupid son of a bitch.\u201d The President later called the reporter to apologize. Each of the geopolitical factors listed above are on display in Putin\u2019s challenge to the West over Ukraine as he seeks to restore some of the strategic sway once held by the Soviet Union over Eastern Europe around the symbolic 30th anniversary of his beloved empire\u2019s collapse. After massing more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s border, the Russian leader made a series of demands for US concessions, including an assurance that the Kyiv government will never join NATO and for the alliance to pull back troops and armaments from ex-Warsaw Pact states that joined the West since they feared the kind of Russian resurgence that Putin is trying to engineer. Biden has responded by seeking a gradual escalation of pressure designed to convince Putin that the cost of invading Ukraine would be too high, promising sanctions that could cripple the Russian economy and cause knock-on political threats to his rule. Now, the President is mulling a reinforcement of NATO\u2019s eastern flank with possible troop deployments. The alliance on Monday announced some smaller deployments to the Baltic and Eastern European member states. For the first time since the Cold War, a US carrier strike group will be placed under NATO command in the Mediterranean for a high-level maritime exercise this week. This is all meant to project resolve, deterrence and to show that Putin\u2019s attempt to get the US out of Europe will fail. It is incumbent on Biden to show Washington has the back of its allies. If he doesn\u2019t, NATO will count for nothing. But it\u2019s a high-risk plan since US deployments could prompt the Russian leader to pull the trigger he has to Ukraine\u2019s head and to argue he must invade to protect Russian security. Putin is an infuriating, unpredictable adversary, and has forced the US to react to his provocations for weeks. It\u2019s impossible to read his intentions. US diplomacy so far, including a Biden-Putin meeting in Geneva last year and more recent online encounters between the presidents, have yielded no breakthroughs. It has, however, handed Putin the prestige of Cold War-style summits that led Republicans to accuse Biden of that dreaded word \u2013 appeasement. In the latest demonstration of Putin\u2019s penchant for mind games, he and Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel spoke by phone on Monday and agreed to deeper cooperation. Some Russian military officials have suggested deploying military assets to Cuba and Venezuela during the crisis over Ukraine. The allusions to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 \u2013 the US-Soviet standoff in which the world came close to nuclear war \u2013 are hard to miss. Some analysts believe that Putin has put himself in a box and will be unable to exit the showdown without at least a limited penetration into Ukraine that would save face. This is why Biden whipped up so much controversy last week when he suggested that a \u201cminor incursion\u201d by Russia would not draw the full sanctions broadside. But the US President was also telling the truth, apparently referring to divisions among allies in Europe about how to handle Putin. The Russian leader\u2019s timing is no accident as he tries to probe divisions between European powers internally and with the United States over the crisis. This is a transitional period for the three major European powers. Germany has a new governing coalition that is split on foreign policy, knows it is reliant on Russian gas in the winter and remains wary of offensive military operations owing to its historic scar of militarism. French President Emmanuel Macron faces reelection in April, and is using the crisis to push for a more aggressive European Union role that might weaken US authority. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is mired in boozy scandals and struggling to cling onto power. The government in London is also locked in a bitter estrangement with its near allies over its exit from the EU. Biden made a public point of addressing divides in Europe on Monday, gathering leaders in a video call and orchestrating a series of statements on both sides of the Atlantic promising unity on the crisis and the costs that Russia could face. \u201cI had a very, very, very good meeting \u2013 total unanimity with all the European leaders,\u201d Biden told reporters afterward. But there\u2019s reason to doubt his confidence. The European Union, for example, saw no need to follow the US in authorizing the departure of nonessential staff and family members from Kyiv. Officials on the other side of the Atlantic have not used the same kind of alarmist language as the Biden administration about the imminent threat of a Russian invasion. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Monday that though unity and pressure on Russia was vital, the situation was not irretrievable. \u201cCertainly, I have reason to be concerned but I don\u2019t want to go in a nervous attack,\u201d Borrell told Hala Gorani on CNN International. Managing different threat perceptions with Europe is just one of the challenges that Biden faces in navigating the Ukraine showdown, one of the most testing moments in the recent history of NATO. And he knows that even if he can engineer a peaceful resolution, China, North Korea and Iran are up next, posing more intractable challenges for a presidency never free from crises.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden and Western allies are signaling a stiffened stance in the showdown with Russia, piling on pressure designed to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine in a strategy that nevertheless risks quickening a dangerous cycle of escalation. The White House pivot comes with Biden now under searing pressure from Republicans to show more strength in the confrontation and follows a week in which he was heavily criticized for hastily walked-back comments that played into the Russian leader\u2019s hopes of dividing NATO. Several Republicans accused the President of showing weakness and appeasing Putin in talk show appearances on Sunday. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck a jarring tone by describing the Kremlin strongman as a \u201cvery talented statesman\u201d who knew how to use power. GOP critiques of Biden ignored the party\u2019s tolerance of ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s craven deference to the Russian leader and some came across as an attempt to use a national security crisis to damage Biden politically ahead of midterm elections in 2022 and the 2024 presidential election. Why Russia's Ukraine aggression matters to Americans A series of moves, comments and signals from Washington and Europe over the weekend underscored the deepening peril of the situation at a time when there appears little meaningful diplomatic activity to stop its rapid deterioration. The State Department said Sunday it was authorizing the departure of non-essential staff and family members from its embassy in Kyiv and warned that in the event of a Russian invasion its capacity to help Americans in the country would be limited. In another significant development, administration officials said the President had discussed options that include deploying between 1,000 and 5,000 troops plus aircraft and ships to US allies in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe. NATO said early Monday that several member states, including France, Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands were either sending or considering small deployments of ships and aircraft to the Baltic and eastern European states. The mostly symbolic maneuvers appear calibrated to send a signal of resolve to Putin while avoiding the impression of a larger-scale mobilization that could send tensions spiraling out of control. \u201cWe will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense,\u201d alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that if a single Russian unit entered Ukraine it \u201cwould trigger a swift, a severe and a united response\u201d from the US and Europe. Britain, meanwhile, warned that it had intelligence that Putin was trying to install a puppet leader in place of the democratically elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And the head of Germany\u2019s navy was forced to resign after comments sympathetic to Russia in a drama that suggested an effort to cover-up deep divisions within the West about how to handle Putin. Until now, the US has concentrated on sketching the dire consequences, in the form of debilitating sanctions, that it says would effectively cut Russia off from the Western economy in the event of an invasion. But the latest tactical decisions darkened an already foreboding atmosphere after Biden said last week that he believed that the decision on whether to invade Ukraine was Putin\u2019s dilemma alone. Talk of deploying troops also came across as a direct challenge to the Russian leader while at the same time being apparently designed to protect Biden\u2019s political flank at home. Biden presented with options to bolster troop levels in Europe as Russian troops mass on Ukraine's borders While the State Department said that it was acting out of an abundance of caution, drawing down embassy staffing is also a classic act of diplomatic symbolism that denotes a worsening crisis. Officials said any move to reinforce NATO flanks would be intended to \u201cprovide deterrence and reassurance to allies.\u201d It was not immediately clear whether deployments would come before or after any Russian invasion of Ukraine. But even talking about such steps puts Putin on notice that the entire premise of his hostage hold on Ukraine \u2013 to force NATO to withdraw forces from ex-Soviet states \u2013 would backfire. Yet the increasingly robust Western gambit is also a risk. It could convince Putin that he is right to warn that Russian security is threatened by the West. At the very least it could give him a propaganda pretext to invade Ukraine. And Biden must consider whether high-profile troop deployments before an invasion that the US says could come at any time could make it even harder for Putin to back down without securing a tangible payoff for his troop buildup. The latest US signals came after Russia amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders and initiated a new deployment of forces to Belarus, further surrounding its former Soviet client state, and after the government in Kyiv said that Moscow would soon have enough forces for a full-scale invasion. But Biden\u2019s latest steps will not satisfy Republicans who have demanded a much more aggressive US mobilization and are using the crisis to portray Biden as a feckless leader. Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Sunday urged the White House to use sanctions against Russia before any invasion as requested by the government of Ukraine. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something strong right now, I\u2019m afraid that he\u2019s going to invade Ukraine, which will have global ramifications here,\u201d the Texas Republican said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d But Blinken rejected such an approach, warning that it would diminish the chances that concerns about consequences could influence Putin\u2019s decision. \u201cWhen it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression,\u201d Blinken said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cAnd so, if they\u2019re triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect.\u201d Ukraine receives second weapons shipment from US McCaul also laid into Biden over the administration\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer, saying that it had convinced the Russian leader that the United States would not stand up for its interests. \u201cI think this all started \u2026 with Afghanistan, and the unconditional surrender to the Taliban when he saw weakness. Weakness invited aggression,\u201d McCaul said on CBS. \u201cWe\u2019re seen as weak right now \u2026  because of President Biden.\u201d (The administration argues the evacuation from Afghanistan was a huge success, but the initial debacle shocked US allies, left some to question the US\u2019 global commitment and helped hammer the President\u2019s approval ratings). The administration counters GOP criticism by saying that an agreement the Trump administration reached with the Taliban gave it no choice but to leave the country. Pompeo insisted on Fox that the previous administration had won Putin\u2019s respect by being strong, the result being that he \u201cdidn\u2019t use coercive activity to try to push back on NATO.\u201d It\u2019s true that some members of the Western alliance did increase military spending after Trump\u2019s complaints about the US being ripped off by its allies \u2013 though perceptions of a rising Russian threat and his antipathy to the idea of defending allies also contributed. And the ex-President did allow lethal US aid to be sent to Ukraine, unlike former President Barack Obama. But his desire for Putin\u2019s approval often seemed to undermine his own administration\u2019s policy. His withdrawal from Syria, constant berating of NATO allies and denial of Russian election meddling advanced Putin\u2019s foreign policy goals. But Pompeo also offered gushing praise of the Russian leader\u2019s intellect that seemed tonally odd given that he\u2019s a US adversary currently threatening an armed takeover of a democracy supported by Washington. \u201cWe had respect for him and his power. He\u2019s a very talented statesman,\u201d Pompeo said on Fox. \u201cHe has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent, for goodness\u2019 sakes. He knows how to use power, we should respect that.\u201d The idea that the United States should respect a leader who rules with an iron fist, who crushed democracy and freedom of the press, imprisons political opponents and presides over a corrupt economy that empowers oligarchs is notable coming from an ex-secretary of state. Foreign policy experts often divide on the question of whether Putin is playing a tough hand with aplomb or whether his international gangsterism is more the act of a weak leader terrified of legitimate opposition and being forced from power. It\u2019s also questionable whether massing troops on the border of a vulnerable democracy and making outlandish demands of NATO is the behavior of a \u201ctalented statesman.\u201d And any arguments that Putin was cowed by Trump from using coercion against the West are confounded by US intelligence assessments that Moscow interfered in US elections. The then-President stunned the US espionage community by disowning assessments of Putin\u2019s 2016 meddling when he appeared side-by-side with him at a press conference in Helsinki. Cyberattacks emanating from Russian soil also took place throughout the Trump presidency, including the SolarWinds operation that breached US federal agencies when the former President was in power. Supposed respect for the US didn\u2019t stop Russian agents using a biological weapon on British soil to poison a defector, according to the UK government. The willingness of the GOP to criticize Biden, despite these huge blemishes on Trump\u2019s record, shows that for many of its members, with a few exceptions like McCaul, politics take priority over national security in the pursuit of future power. Such an approach only widens the divides on which Putin relies as he seeks to tarnish American prestige. Jim Sciutto, Kylie Atwood and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Escalating psychological warfare between the United States and Russia over Ukraine is fast approaching a point at which a peaceful exit from a crisis with real-world ramifications for Americans could be impossible. President Joe Biden, backed by the full symbolic power of the Western alliance, is locked in a showdown with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is using Ukraine as a hostage to try to force the US to renegotiate the settled outcome of the Cold War. Neither man is blinking. To do so may be unfeasible, given the huge political stakes both have wagered. The showdown in Eastern Europe might feel like someone else\u2019s problem as Americans face a pandemic and high inflation, and wage their own political battles. And Biden has already said he won\u2019t send US troops to non-NATO Ukraine. But the reality is that the world\u2019s two top nuclear powers are dueling out their most tense test of wills since the fall of the Soviet Union. A Russian invasion of Ukraine could trigger the biggest clash of regular conventional armies in Europe since World War II. At stake for Americans are the credibility of the West, perceptions of US global power and the possibility of secondary consequences that hit hard at home \u2013 for instance, a crisis-fueled spike in energy prices. Ukrainian President pushes back on Biden: 'There are no minor incursions' To try to pull back from the brink, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meet in Geneva on Friday. As the meeting in Geneva began, Lavrov told Blinken that Moscow is \u201cnot expecting a breakthrough\u201d from the talks but does expect \u201canswers to our proposals.\u201d The US is not dropping its refusal to accept concessions demanded by Putin that would severely compromise NATO. And US threats of unprecedented, punishing sanctions on Russia if it invades plus efforts to offer Putin an off-ramp have not worked. In fact, the government in Kyiv says Russia has nearly completed the buildup of forces that would permit a full-scale invasion. The strongman in the Kremlin, who has 100,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders, is keeping the world guessing with a game of great power poker. That\u2019s exactly how Putin, who lives to knock adversaries off balance, likes it. Some analysts believe the Russian leader is bluffing and created the invasion threat to win equal superpower billing in talks with the US. Others see a bid to destabilize Ukraine short of an invasion or a nationalist play for popularity at home. But Putin may also sense weakness in the US and division in Europe, and reason that if he\u2019s ever to crush Ukraine\u2019s hopes of a pro-Western future, now is the time. With the US refusing his demands, and with so much of his prestige wrapped up in the crisis, it seems unlikely that he\u2019ll just pack up and go home. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m confident of is that decision is totally, solely, completely, a Putin decision,\u201d Biden said during a White House news conference Wednesday. \u201cNobody else is going to make that decision; no one else is going to impact that decision. He\u2019s making that decision.\u201d To understand that decision, it\u2019s necessary to appreciate why Ukraine is so important to the Russian leader. For the former KGB officer, the demise of the Soviet Union was a historic disaster. He interpreted NATO\u2019s eastward expansion as the humiliation of a great civilization. This explains why he has demanded concessions Biden can never accept \u2013 including an assurance that Ukraine never join NATO and a demand for the removal of Western troops and armaments from former Warsaw Pact states like Poland and Romania that he sees as a threat to Russian security. Over the last decade or so, Putin has sought to re-create Russia\u2019s old sphere of influence over former Soviet states like Ukraine. The scheme resulted in the annexation of Crimea, sovereign Ukrainian territory, in 2014. More recently, Putin backed the suppression of political protests in Belarus and Kazakhstan. Given his own autocratic regime, it\u2019s also clear that a thriving, prosperous, Western-oriented democracy in Ukraine is intolerable. It might become an example to emulate for Russians tired of his long rule, corruption and repression. Opinion: These maps show why Putin might invade Ukraine Biden\u2019s news conference will be remembered for a gaffe in which he suggested the full weight of sanctions against Russia might not be imposed if Putin engineered only a \u201cminor incursion,\u201d a statement the President rowed back Thursday. But it also featured a candid exposition by Biden on Putin\u2019s motives. The President speculated the Russian leader was fighting to avenge history and for a 21st-century role for Russia. \u201cThe Berlin Wall came down, the empire has been lost, the near abroad is gone, etc. The Soviet Union has been split,\u201d Biden said, guessing at Putin\u2019s worldview. \u201cBut think about what he has,\u201d the President continued. \u201cHe has eight time zones, a burning tundra that will not freeze again naturally, a situation where he has a lot of oil and gas, but he is trying to find his place in the world between China and the West.\u201d Another component of Putin\u2019s Russian restoration project is tarnishing the prestige of the West and especially the United States, a secondary goal of the Ukraine gambit. That\u2019s also where his election-meddling efforts come in. While there are arguments about whether his intervention in favor of Donald Trump and against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was decisive in 2016, it did unleash destructive political forces inside the US. The candidate he supported, and who genuflected before him as President, is now leading an assault on American democracy that coincides with Putin\u2019s goals. And Biden is weakened at home during the Ukraine showdown because Trump ensured that he is seen as an illegitimate President by millions of citizens. Putin can never have hoped for such an outcome. Putin\u2019s challenges help explain Biden\u2019s approach to the crisis. He spent weeks trying to unite the Western allies, which Putin is trying to divide, on a package of sanctions that would effectively cut off Russia from the Western economy. This is why Biden\u2019s comments on Wednesday were so damaging \u2013 because he basically admitted the West wasn\u2019t on the same page. But he was also telling the truth. French President Emmanuel Macron, for instance, this week called for a European channel to Putin, offering a divide with the US for the Russian leader to exploit. As well as promising sanctions that would rupture many of Russia\u2019s links with the developed world, Biden appears to be playing a risky mind game with Putin as he tackles his lonely decision. He sketched a picture of a prolonged, bloody insurgency in Ukraine at a time when Washington is mulling an effort to arm the Kyiv government as it did the Afghan Mujahedeen who ousted the Soviet Union from Afghanistan in the 1980s. US accuses Russia of recruiting officials in attempt to take over Ukrainian government \u201cYou can go in and, over time, at great loss and economic loss, go in and occupy Ukraine. But how many years? One? Three? Five? Ten? What is that going to take? What toll does that take? It\u2019s real. It\u2019s consequential,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. The chances of a quagmire in Ukraine must weigh on Putin, given his sensitivity to political opposition and the high numbers of conscripts in the Russian military who might start coming home in body bags. It might also augur a more limited incursion by special and irregular forces and intelligence assets. One of the most curious aspects of the US approach to the Ukraine crisis has been the alarmist US rhetoric about an imminent invasion, and leaking of intelligence reports about the Russian buildup. It\u2019s hard to say whether the administration is providing political cover for itself to show it\u2019s not been caught by surprise if Russian tanks cross the border. Washington could also be emphasizing the threat in order to coerce Europeans into sanctions threats. For instance, the US has long been at odds with Germany over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline built to carry Russian gas to Western Europe. The new government in Berlin has now signaled it would halt the gas flow if Russia invades Ukraine. At times, however, it has seemed as though the US has almost been goading Putin with its statements about a likely invasion \u2013 including those by Biden on Wednesday. Such a tactic might increase the pressure on the Russian leader \u2013 but it\u2019s a huge gamble. But Putin is not the only one under huge political duress. Biden is too. A Russian invasion would represent a grave challenge to Europe \u2013 which still relies on the US as its security guarantor \u2013 creating a consuming foreign-policy headache for a presidency already reeling from crises. World politics would be rocked by an ostracized Russia even more determined to frustrate Washington\u2019s goals. Biden might have to rush troops to reinforce NATO allies in the Baltic in order to deter further Russian expansionism. And a new European standoff would distract the US from its main strategic struggle in the coming decades: the global challenge posed by China. Fact-checking six claims from Biden's news conference Furthermore, the principles that underpin American leadership of a community of free nations would be shattered if a strongman can destroy a smaller democracy without consequences. China and Taiwan, especially, will be watching how the US responds. The crisis has far-reaching domestic implications as well. If Putin invades now, Biden will look weak. He\u2019s already come across as constantly catching up to Putin\u2019s pacesetting. His summit with the Russian leader in Geneva last year will be branded by critics as appeasement. His plight would be a gift for Republicans portraying him as confused and bumbling ahead of midterm elections this year and the presidential election in 2024. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell gave a taste of those attacks on Thursday, describing Biden\u2019s comments about a possible \u201cminor incursion\u201d by Russia as \u201cbizarre and devastating.\u201d \u201cWhy is our President speculating like a passive observer on the sidelines? He isn\u2019t a pundit. He isn\u2019t Putin\u2019s psychoanalyst. He\u2019s the President of the United States,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. His disdainful critique emphasized how Biden, just like Putin, cannot afford to lose the test of wills that will play out in the tense days to come.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden laid out his vision for the next chapter of his presidency during a nearly two-hour-long White House news conference on Wednesday, saying he\u2019s prepared to make changes as he faces crises at home and abroad. As he heads into year two in the Oval Office, Biden held a wide-ranging question-and-answer session with reporters during which he angered his Ukrainian allies with comments about a potential Russian \u201cincursion\u201d into their country, and he admitted he would be breaking up one of his major legislative priorities. Biden also signaled that his dreams of bipartisanship had largely been dashed during his first year in office, though he was still confident in how his party will do in the 2022 midterm elections. Biden told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny that he\u2019s ready to switch up his approach during the coming year. After spending much of his first year in office at the White House or one of his Delaware properties, Biden said he wants to solicit more outside advice and speak to more people outside the building. The President has traveled less often than his predecessors, restrained by the pandemic. He has visited comparatively fewer states and been outside the US only twice. \u201cI\u2019m going to go out and talk to the public. I\u2019m going to do public fora. I\u2019m going to interface with them. I\u2019m going to make the case of what we\u2019ve already done, why it\u2019s important and what we\u2019ll do \u2013 what will happen if they support what else I want to do,\u201d he said. Biden said he also plans to engage more with Democrats during the midterm elections. Fact check: A look at Biden's first year in false claims \u201cI\u2019m going to be deeply involved in these off-year elections,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be raising a lot of money. We\u2019re going to be out there making sure that we\u2019re helping all those candidates, and scores of them already asked me to come in and campaign with them, to go out and make the case in plain simple language as to what it is we have done, what we want to do and why we think it\u2019s important.\u201d Still, despite his planned changes, the President defended his approach to many issues, saying he \u201cmakes no apologies\u201d for his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and dismissing questions of competency in regards to the rollout of 5G networks and the response to Covid-19. He said he\u2019s satisfied with his team, confirming that Vice President Kamala Harris will be his reelection running mate and defending top public health officials, like US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, amid mixed messaging on the pandemic. The President said he\u2019s changing his approach to how he handles a signature legislative goal, saying he believes Congress can pass \u201cbig chunks\u201d of his sweeping social safety net and climate spending plan, Build Back Better, and acknowledging that negotiators will have to \u201cfight for the rest later.\u201d \u201cYes, well, it\u2019s clear to me that we\u2019re going to have to break it up,\u201d the President said. The 7 most important lines from Joe Biden's news conference In particular, Biden indicated that he believes Congress can pass funding for energy and environmental issues, and that he has support from West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, a key moderate, on the plan\u2019s early education proposals. In addition, he indicated that there\u2019s \u201cstrong support\u201d for the proposal on how the provisions will be paid for. He later said he\u2019s \u201cunsure\u201d whether he\u2019ll be able to get the child tax credit provision and funding to assist with the cost of college passed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unrealistic about what we\u2019re asking for. I\u2019m not asking for castles in the sky. I\u2019m asking for practical things the American people have been asking for for a long time. A long time. And I think we can get it done,\u201d he said. Biden cited lower prices for on prescription drugs, expanded education funding and support for child care as popular provisions. \u201cI don\u2019t know many things that have been done in one fell swoop. And so I think the most important thing to do is try to inform \u2026 the public what\u2019s at stake in stark terms and let them make judgments and let them know who is for them and who is against them. Who is there and who is not there, and make that the case. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be spending my time doing in this off-year election,\u201d Biden continued. The President also acknowledged that passing his other legislative priority, voting reform, will be difficult. Still, he insisted that Democrats still have options to get it passed. Biden said the perception by some Americans that his push to pass election reform is a last-minute effort is a \u201cproblem that is my own making,\u201d stressing that he has been fighting to ensure Americans have access to the ballot for decades. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult. I make no bones about that. It\u2019s going to be difficult, but we\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019ve not run out of options yet. And we\u2019ll see how this moves,\u201d Biden told reporters. Later Wednesday, Biden issued a statement after Senate Democrats failed to change Senate rules to advance two major voting rights measures, saying, \u201cI am profoundly disappointed that the United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy. I am disappointed \u2014 but I am not deterred.\u201d \u201cAs dangerous new Republican laws plainly designed to suppress and subvert voting rights proliferate in states across the country, we will explore every measure and use every tool at our disposal to stand up for democracy,\u201d the President added later. Biden, in his opening comments at the news conference, said that \u201cit\u2019s been a year of challenges, but it\u2019s also been a year of enormous progress.\u201d Jill Biden's whirlwind first year as the President's eyes and ears across America The President \u2013  who fielded questions from reporters as his administration struggles to contain the latest surge of the Omicron coronavirus variant and works to ease the economic anxiety gripping the nation \u2013 began his White House news conference touting how the administration has made strides in Covid-19 vaccinations, reopening the economy, creating jobs and lowering unemployment. But he also acknowledged the challenges facing his administration as he enters his second year in office. He said there continues to be \u201cfrustration and fatigue in this country\u201d over Covid-19, reiterating that \u201cwhile it\u2019s cause for concern, it\u2019s not cause for panic.\u201d The President conceded that his team should have done more to ramp up testing, but listed steps he\u2019s taken to make kits more available, arguing that \u201cwe\u2019re in a better place than we have been thus far, clearly better than a year ago.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up and accept things as they are now. Some people may call what\u2019s happening now the new normal. I call it a job not yet finished. It will get better. We\u2019re moving toward a time when Covid-19 won\u2019t disrupt our daily lives,\u201d he continued. In his opening remarks, the President also addressed the economic complications of the pandemic, including rising prices for consumers, saying, \u201cWe need to get inflation under control\u201d and calling on the Federal Reserve to \u201cbear down on fighting inflation.\u201d Biden added that he respects the independence of the Fed. The news conference comes as the President heads into his second year in office \u2013 a midterm election year \u2013 after facing a number of recent setbacks. The centerpiece of his economic agenda has hit a roadblock in Congress, it is unclear whether the Democrats\u2019 push for voting rights legislation will go anywhere, the Supreme Court struck down Biden\u2019s vaccine mandates for big businesses and recent key economic indicators show record inflation. Biden predicted a Russian invasion of Ukraine, citing existential concerns by the country\u2019s President Vladimir Putin, even as he warned of significant economic consequences when such an incursion occurs. But he suggested a \u201cminor incursion\u201d would elicit a lesser response than a full-scale invasion. Putin has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and appears poised to invade. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure he is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something,\u201d Biden said, describing a leader searching for relevance in a post-Soviet world: \u201cHe is trying to find his place in the world between China and the West.\u201d Blinken says Russia could double troops on Ukraine's borders in 'short order' Biden\u2019s prediction of an invasion is the firmest acknowledgment to date that the US fully expects Putin to move after amassing 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border. The President also said allies and partners \u201care ready to impose severe cost and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.\u201d That includes limiting Russian transactions in US financial institutions \u2013 \u201canything that involves dollar denominations,\u201d Biden said. He also warned Russian lives would be lost in an invasion, along with potential Ukranian casualties. Biden speculated Putin was not seeking \u201cany full-blown war,\u201d but said he did believe the Russian leader was looking for some type of confrontation. \u201cDo I think he\u2019ll test the West? Test the United States and NATO as significantly as he can? Yes, I think he will. But I think he\u2019ll pay a serious and dear price for it.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think it will cost him what it\u2019s going to cost him,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019ll regret having done it.\u201d Throughout the news conference, Biden indicated his frustration with GOP lawmakers who have stood against his agenda. He claimed that Republicans were not as \u201cobstructionist\u201d toward former President Barack Obama as they are to his own administration. \u201cThey weren\u2019t nearly as obstructionist as they are now,\u201d Biden said when pressed on similarities in the Republican Party\u2019s obstruction tactics to both his and the Obama administrations. Pelosi says Democrats are considering adding Covid-19 relief to larger bill \u201cThe difference here is there seems to be a desire \u2026 what are they for? What is their agenda? They had an agenda back in the administration \u2013 the eight years we were President and vice president \u2013 but I don\u2019t know what their agenda is now. What is it?\u201d Biden stated. Speaking of his time as vice president in the Obama administration, Biden said the difference is they were able to \u201cget some things done\u201d when the atmosphere wasn\u2019t ideologically divisive. Earlier in the news conference, Biden said that \u201cone thing\u201d he hasn\u2019t been able to do is \u201cget my Republican friends to get in the game in making things better for this country.\u201d \u201cI did not anticipate that there\u2019d be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden did not get anything done. Think about this. What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they\u2019re for,\u201d Biden said. The President regularly fields questions from reporters after delivering remarks and during departures and arrivals at the White House, but he hasn\u2019t held as many formal news conferences as his recent predecessors. In his first year in office, Biden held nine total news conferences \u2013 six solo and three joint ones \u2013\u00a0according to data tracked by The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The last time he held a formal news conference was\u00a0at the\u00a0COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in November. By comparison, President Donald Trump held 21 news conferences in his first year in office, but just one of them was solo and the rest were joint appearances, usually with foreign leaders. (In his last year in office, as the pandemic took hold, Trump held a staggering 35 solo news conferences.) President Barack Obama held 27 news conferences in his first year \u2013 11 solo and 16 of them joint. President George W. Bush held 19 news conferences \u2013 five solo and 14 joint, according to UCSB data. Then-President Bill Clinton held 12 solo news conferences and 26 joint ones, resulting in 38 news conferences in his first year in office. This story has been updated with further developments.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden held a rare news conference Wednesday afternoon, using the platform to call on Americans to be patient in the fight against Covid-19 and defend his record of success despite middling poll numbers. Biden spoke \u2013 on and off \u2013 for 112 minutes. I pulled out the seven most important lines from what he said. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cI didn\u2019t overpromise. I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen.\u201d Biden took umbrage at the suggestion that he had bitten off more than he could chew, legislatively speaking. And he took a page from his predecessor\u2019s playbook by bragging that he had done better than anyone expected. That\u2019s a debatable contention. He was able to get a Covid stimulus bill and an infrastructure package through Congress and into law. But his Build Back Better Act is languishing and any major voting rights legislation seems a far way off. 2. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to shutting down schools. Schools should stay open.\u201d Biden spent the first 15 minutes of the presser delivering a speech \u2013 much of it centered on his administration\u2019s response to the Covid pandemic. The fundamental message was this: We are not going back to where we were when he took office \u2013 and we don\u2019t need to. His assertion that schools need to stay open was the newsiest bit of that promise \u2013 and one that should have appeal across party lines. 3. \u201cI am confident we can get big chunks, big pieces, of Build Back Better signed into law.\u201d There are two important things happening here: a) Biden admitting that his BBB bill isn\u2019t going to pass and b) endorsing the carving up of the legislation to get some of the more popular pieces of it approved. That\u2019s a strategy that acknowledges the political reality that Democrats badly need a legislative win on his domestic agenda and that his long-held hopes for BBB to pass in its entirety are now dashed. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that we are going to have to, probably, break it up,\u201d Biden said later of the bill. 4. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure [Russian President Vladimir Putin] is certain what he is going to do. My guess is he will move in [to Ukraine]. He has to do something.\u201d This was a WOW moment for anyone with even a passing knowledge of the current situation on the Ukraine border.  Biden, repeatedly questioned in follow-ups about this initial pronouncement, seemed to walk it back \u2013 insisting that he didn\u2019t know Putin\u2019s plan in terms of an invasion of eastern Ukraine (and his belief that Putin hasn\u2019t made up his mind). Still, the initial claim is going to draw lots and lots of attention and scrutiny. 5. \u201cOne thing I haven\u2019t been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game at making things better in this country. \u2026 What are they for? Name one thing they are for.\u201d This will be the Biden message in the coming midterm elections: that he has reached across the aisle to try to get Republicans on board with various policies and they have been unwilling to do so. That the only Republican policy is that of obstruction of his agenda. That they don\u2019t have a proactive agenda. Which, well, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell is probably fine with. \u201cThis midterm election will be a report card on the performance of this entire Democratic government, the President, the House and the Senate,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said Wednesday. 6. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have a referendum on how I handled the economy.\u201d Biden is very, very likely to get his wish, as Republicans have made clear that they believe they can win House and Senate majorities by focusing on inflation and supply chain issues impacting the country. Biden (and other Democrats) will point to the shrinking unemployment rate as a sign that things are moving in the right direction. Where does the public land on the question? In a December CNN poll, just 44% approved of how he was handling the economy, while 55% disapproved. As CNN\u2019s Harry Enten has noted, that\u2019s the \u201clowest net economic rating of any president at this point through their first term since at least Jimmy Carter in 1977.\u201d 7. \u201cIt could easily be illegitimate. \u2026 The increase in the prospect of [the 2022 election] being illegitimate is in proportion to not being able to get these reforms passed.\u201d That\u2019s how Biden answered a question about whether he harbored concerns about the next election\u2019s results being something less than aboveboard. The connection between that prospect and the passage of voting rights reforms \u2013 which, at the moment, appear severely stalled \u2013 is a striking one. If, one has to ask, major voting rights legislation is not passed before the 2022 midterms, does that mean the results \u2013 especially if Republicans win \u2013 are illegitimate? The Point: How Biden did during the presser depends, largely, on where you stand about him generally speaking.  There\u2019s no question, however, that his insistence that he is comfortable with the 2022 midterms being a referendum on the economy will give party strategists some heartburn.",

            "article_content": "By the time President Joe Biden was climbing into his limousine on Capitol Hill, his Thursday was already going poorly. An hour before he\u2019d arrived to meet Senate Democrats, Arizona centrist Sen. Kyrsten Sinema declared on the Senate floor she couldn\u2019t support any changes to filibuster rules that would be required to pass new voter protection laws. It was less-than-welcome news to the White House, which learned of Sinema\u2019s plans earlier in the day as aides were preparing for Biden\u2019s visit. The President was met with a standing ovation among members of his party when he arrived for their meeting in the Kennedy Caucus Room. But when he emerged again 70 minutes later, the President\u2019s fury at the impasse was obvious. \u201cState and legislative bodies continue to change the law not as to who can vote, but who gets to count the vote. Count the vote. Count the vote,\u201d Biden inveighed, his voice rising to a shout and echoing in the roof of Russell Rotunda, before walking briskly to his car. As his motorcade was making the short return trip to the White House, another blow arrived, this time from the Supreme Court. The conservative majority blocked his attempt to compel businesses to require their workers be vaccinated, an outcome that aides had been bracing for after the President reluctantly issued the mandate order last fall. Biden was informed of the decision as he returned inside the Oval Office. Setbacks at the hands of Congress or the courts are part of life for any president, as Biden likely remembers from his eight years in the Obama White House. But the string of disappointments within a couple of hours on Thursday was stark \u2013 and will also likely sting given Biden\u2019s long history with both institutions. Paired with his stalled domestic agenda, a volatile crisis on the Russia-Ukraine border and softening approval ratings, Thursday\u2019s developments only aggravated the impression of a President faltering as he enters his second year in office. The White House views the situation differently. Aides point to a vaccination campaign that started last year, record job growth, rebuilt foreign alliances and two large pieces of legislation \u2013 a Covid-19 relief package passed in March and the bipartisan infrastructure bill approved in November \u2013 as evidence of a successful presidency so far. And they frame the current setbacks as signs Biden is willing to attempt the difficult rather than settle for the easy. \u201cHaving worked in a White House before, you do hard things in White Houses. You have every challenge laid at your feet, whether it\u2019s global or domestically,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday after a day of difficulties. \u201cWe could certainly propose legislation to see if people support bunny rabbits and ice cream, but that wouldn\u2019t be very rewarding to the American people. So, the President\u2019s view is we\u2019re going to keep pushing for hard things and we\u2019re going to keep pushing the boulders up the hill to get it done.\u201d The boulder-pushing was continuing Thursday evening at the White House, where Biden met with Sinema and her fellow centrist, Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The trio planned to discuss voting rights, though each senators\u2019 definitive statements opposing changes to the filibuster made for an unclear path forward. Still, the hopeful approach \u2013 which Biden has also adopted, declaring himself a \u201ccongenital optimist\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t mask mounting frustration at the state of the President\u2019s agenda. Government figures this week showing inflation still at a near-40-year high led to another round of questions about the President\u2019s economic ambitions. And talks with Russia meant to defuse the crisis with Ukraine ended without much hope Vladimir Putin intends to deescalate. Ahead of a major speech in Atlanta this week on voting rights, Biden faced anger from activists who boycotted the address and said they wanted to see more concrete plans to get something done. Even some who attended the speech said afterward they wanted to see the President step up his efforts. \u201cWhile President Biden delivered a stirring speech today, it\u2019s time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job,\u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson wrote in a statement. \u201cVoting rights should not simply be a priority \u2014 it must be THE priority.\u201d On Covid, some of Biden\u2019s top former advisers went public last week with a plea for him to change course on the pandemic, saying it was time to adopt a strategy geared more toward a \u201cnew normal\u201d of living with coronavirus permanently. And more than 50 Democrats wrote the White House this week encouraging a more robust testing strategy. Biden\u2019s own frustration at both matters has become plain. He has vented in public that a stubbornly large percentage of Americans refuse to be vaccinated, prolonging the pandemic. And on Thursday, he flashed anger at the prospect of fellow Democrats stymieing attempts to pass bills bolstering voting rights, which he has said is the single most important issue currently facing the nation. \u201cAs long as I have a breath in me, as long as I\u2019m in the White House, as long as I\u2019m engaged at all, I\u2019m going to be fighting to change the way these legislatures have been moving,\u201d he declared. Behind the scenes, Biden has voiced agitation that some of the problems he is currently facing can\u2019t seem to be resolved. Along with reforms to voting laws, Biden had envisioned a major expansion of the social safety net and billions in new spending on climate change, all made impossible not only because Republicans universally oppose them but also because two Democrats are holding out. He\u2019d pictured a country on the road to healing after the divisions exacerbated by his predecessor, whose unyielding sway over the Republican Party and lie about Biden\u2019s electoral history has persisted beyond Biden\u2019s expectations. And he had once hoped this would be the year the country was returning to normal after nearly two years of pandemic-dampened life, but the current surge caused by the Omicron variant caught the White House off guard, leading Biden to say publicly he wished he\u2019d thought earlier of ordering more tests. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision Thursday was not unexpected among Biden\u2019s team, who\u2019d been preparing for the outcome. But it did exacerbate an ongoing debate among his team at how aggressively to pursue vaccine mandates as a strategy for ending the pandemic. When Biden turned to the new rules last year, it came after months of holding off for fear the mandates could further alienate vaccine resisters. \u201cThe Court has ruled that my administration cannot use the authority granted to it by Congress to require this measure, but that does not stop me from using my voice as President to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans\u2019 health and economy,\u201d Biden said in a statement afterward. Psaki demurred when asked Thursday whether Biden was considering any changes to overcome the current challenges, like a shift in his legislative strategy or a shuffle of his West Wing leadership. \u201cOur effort is to do hard things, try hard things, and keep at it. We just don\u2019t view it through the same prism,\u201d she said. Entering his second year, Biden hopes to regain the initiative by drawing sharper contrasts with Republicans and resetting expectations that even some of his allies believe were oversized when he entered office. Beginning at last week\u2019s anniversary of the January 6 insurrection, he has adopted a sharper tone to describe Republicans who have helped former President Donald Trump cultivate the lie that the 2020 presidential election was marred by fraud. And on Thursday, before traveling to Capitol Hill, Biden made a \u201cspecial appeal\u201d to media outlets and social media platforms to take action to prevent bad information about the pandemic from spreading. \u201cPlease deal with the misinformation and disinformation that\u2019s on your shows. It has to stop,\u201d he said. The approach has not been universally welcomed, even among Democrats. Biden\u2019s impassioned call for new voting rights bills on Tuesday in Atlanta included a particularly sharp passage \u2013 written with the help of presidential historian Jon Meacham \u2013 that asked whether lawmakers wanted \u201cto be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace,\u201d \u201cJohn Lewis or Bull Connor\u201d or \u201cAbraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis.\u201d Pressed about those comparisons on Wednesday, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin acknowledged the language pushed the envelope. \u201cPerhaps the President went a little too far in his rhetoric,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of us do.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A woman and a child were wounded when several rockets hit Baghdad\u2019s fortified Green Zone, including the US embassy, on Thursday, the embassy and Iraqi military said in statements. US personnel in the area are safe following the attacks, a State Department official told CNN. \u201cThe U.S. Embassy compound was attacked this evening by terrorist groups attempting to undermine Iraq\u2019s security, sovereignty, and international relations,\u201d the embassy said in a statement. \u201cWe have long said that these sorts of reprehensible attacks are an assault not just on diplomatic facilities but on the sovereignty of Iraq itself,\u201d the embassy added in the tweeted statement. The Iraqi military said \u201ca cowardly terrorist act\u201d targeted \u201cinnocent residents of the Green Zone in Baghdad and the headquarters of the diplomatic missions.\u201d Several missiles were launched from the Dora neighborhood in southern Baghdad, the military said. Security forces are now investigating the incident. Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone houses Iraqi government offices and several embassies. Iraqi President Barham Salih condemned the attack on Thursday, writing on Twitter: \u201cTargeting diplomatic missions and endangering civilians is a criminal terrorist act and a blow to Iraq\u2019s interests and its international reputation.\u201d Thursday\u2019s strikes add to a growing list of attacks on US personnel in the Middle East in recent weeks. Last Wednesday, military bases in Iraq and Syria that house American troops were attacked, though no US forces were killed in the strikes. Last week also saw several other attacks in the region, coinciding with the second anniversary of the US assassination of Qasem Soleimani, a key Iranian general. The attack last week on the US base in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border prompted US-led coalition forces to fire back at Iranian-backed militias who were suspected of being behind the strikes. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters last week that \u201cit\u2019s difficult to know with great specificity and certainty \u2026 what accounts for the frequency of these attacks,\u201d adding: \u201cIt is certainly possible that it could be related to the anniversary of the Soleimani strike. It is certainly possible that it could be related to the change in mission\u201d in Iraq. Echoing Salih\u2019s sentiments, Iraqi anti-American cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr stressed that Thursday\u2019s attacks would only delay the full withdrawal of US troops from the country. Al-Sadr called on all militia groups to stop attacking the US embassy and other sites, saying such acts would \u201cUndermind our efforts to expel (US troops in Iraq) through the UN Security Council, international means and under penalty of law.\u201d The cleric\u2019s political party has emerged as the biggest winner in Iraq\u2019s general election that was held in October 2021. This story has been updated with additional details Thursday.",

            "article_content": "Members of the far right are already agitating to launch impeachment proceedings against President Joe Biden if the GOP is in power in Congress next year. Some leading Republicans want to spotlight former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of voter fraud. And key House and Senate Republicans are vowing to probe the security failures surrounding last year\u2019s January 6 attack on the US Capitol \u2013 and turn the attention to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. With Republicans on the cusp of taking back the House and Senate, the GOP is plotting an onslaught of investigations into the Biden administration and promising to make the final two years of Biden\u2019s first term in office as painful as possible for Democrats in the run-up to 2024. Those headaches could come in the form of subpoenas, the possible creation of select committees and high-profile hearings on issues ranging from the origins of the coronavirus pandemic to hearing from the President\u2019s son, Hunter. Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, said he fully anticipates that Hunter Biden will testify before the committee if Republicans are in charge. \u201cWe have a lot of questions about where he gets his money, from his artwork, and from his consulting deals,\u201d Comer told CNN. The probes won\u2019t stop there. Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois, the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, pledged to subpoena communications from the sergeant-at-arms about security decisions in the lead-up to the deadly Capitol riot should he be in charge of the panel next year. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what went wrong leading up to January 6 with security posture, and most importantly, we\u2019ll exercise oversight responsibility to make sure that we are in a better position,\u201d Davis told CNN. And Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who could be in line to chair a key subcommittee if the GOP is in power, echoed a similar sentiment. Fact-checking Jim Jordan's letter to the Jan. 6 committee \u201cThere\u2019s a larger story to be told about January 6. The House committee\u2019s not interested in looking at it. I mean they\u2019re not asking what Nancy Pelosi knew, when she knew it,\u201d Johnson said, even though Pelosi does not oversee the day-to-day operations of the Capitol Police. \u201cSo, yeah, I think the American public needs a full accounting.\u201d Johnson, who has downplayed Trump\u2019s role in the attack, said: \u201cMy questions by and large have not been answered.\u201d While the party has been mostly eager to move past the deadly events of last January 6, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election, there\u2019s been a growing desire in the party to use its potential congressional majorities next year to fight back against the Democratic effort to probe January 6 \u2013 and try to create a whole new narrative over the insurrection. That fight escalated on Wednesday when committee members asked House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to voluntarily meet and provide information about his communications with Trump. When they were in charge of Congress during Trump\u2019s first two years in office, Republicans often turned a blind eye to the then-President\u2019s controversies and scandals. But with the power to investigate a Democratic President, no controversy will be left unnoticed. There are likely to be points of tension within the GOP conference. January 6 committee weighs options to get members of Congress to comply with their investigation While the GOP push to probe January 6 security failures has the blessing of Republican leadership, it\u2019s uncertain whether the leaders would be willing to investigate Trump\u2019s conspiracies about the 2020 election, even though some Republicans \u2013 including Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who is poised to chair the powerful House Judiciary Committee in a GOP-led House \u2013 want a probe. \u201cWe\u2019ve called for that for a long time,\u201d Jordan said of an investigation into the 2020 election. GOP leaders, however, say such decisions have yet to be made. \u201cWe haven\u2019t rolled out what that agenda would be,\u201d said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana. \u201cUltimately, you know, we\u2019ve got to work to get the majority back. \u2026 And then we got to start having accountability. We need oversight.\u201d Launching an all-out assault on Biden also risks backfiring for a GOP majority if it is perceived by voters as overreaching. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a GOP member of the January 6 committee who is on the outs with her conference over her battles with Trump, rejected the calls to investigate the 2020 election. \u201cWe need to go forward recognizing the damage that the big lie has done,\u201d Cheney told CNN. \u201cAs Republicans, we ought to be in a position where we\u2019re actually learning the lesson of why Donald Trump lost the White House, lost the Senate and lost the House as well, while he was in office, so that we can learn from that and do better.\u201d If they\u2019re in charge, Republican leaders will also have to contend with a growing push from their right flank to initiate impeachment proceedings against Biden, which GOP leaders have so far declined to embrace. Freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial firebrand from Georgia, has already introduced numerous bills to impeach Biden and accuse him of high crimes and misdemeanors. \u201cI believe Joe Biden has intentionally done more to harm the country than any president in American history with the border situation,\u201d said freshman Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus. \u201cHe deserves to be impeached for that alone, let alone anything else.\u201d With the GOP in a strong position heading into the midterm election year, Republicans have already begun to map out how they would wield committee gavels and the subpoena power that comes along with it. Besides the January 6 security failures, other top investigative targets on the GOP\u2019s list include Biden\u2019s chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal; the surge of migrants at the border; Hunter Biden\u2019s art shows and his work in Ukraine; and the origins of the coronavirus and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Congress steps up health protocols amid fresh fears over coronavirus in the Capitol Meanwhile, McCarthy has vowed to boot Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, both from California, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota from key committee assignments if Republicans win back the House, citing the \u201cnew standard\u201d that Democrats created last year by removing Greene and GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona from their committee assignments for inflammatory rhetoric and posts. The GOP\u2019s promise of intense oversight \u2013 combined with threats of retaliation against some Democratic colleagues \u2013 offers an early glimpse of the politically charged atmosphere that would likely dominate a divided Washington. And it could complicate efforts between the parties to come together on must-pass legislative items, like government funding. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a lot of pretty aggressive oversight. Look, there\u2019s not been much now. And I get it. There wasn\u2019t too much oversight, probably, when Trump was there, and we controlled (the House). That\u2019s just a natural rhythm of politics,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the House Rules Committee. \u201cBut, yeah, there\u2019s going to be a demand for it. My gosh, they\u2019ve gotten away with murder here.\u201d Comer, the likely next chairman of the House Oversight Committee, is also interested in looking into the origins of the coronavirus as well as the botched Afghanistan pullout \u2013 and has already made document preservation requests on both fronts. \u201cI\u2019m not going to abuse the subpoena power, but we will use the subpoena power if we feel we have a good case, and we have someone who is not cooperating,\u201d he said. Taliban bans women from solo, long-distance road trips in Afghanistan Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has also made Afghanistan a top priority and already started probing the issue. McCaul hired an investigator last year and made document preservation requests, but he would have far stronger tools to conduct oversight if his party were in power. McCaul is also interested in bringing back an oversight subcommittee to the Foreign Affairs panel. \u201cMy role is to ensure that it doesn\u2019t get swept under the rug, and we are mindful that\u2019s not punitive, but rather we have to get this right,\u201d said McCaul, who already released a report on the origins of Covid-19 and is planning to release a report on Afghanistan next month. Revisiting the 2020 election will also become a focal point among some Republicans, though the GOP is not united on how to dig into Trump\u2019s lies over a stolen election. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who would chair the Senate Judiciary Committee in a GOP majority, said when asked if there should be a probe of the 2020 election: \u201cI think you got to look to the future and make sure that the election laws are working in 2024.\u201d Jordan, a bomb-thrower who once served on the Benghazi select committee, said he would use a potential Judiciary gavel to target Covid, Fauci, education issues, crime and the border. He also signaled support for looking into the 2020 election, a sentiment shared by his fellow Freedom Caucus members. \u201cElection integrity, and things that have been changed regarding the pandemic, that\u2019s an important oversight task or subject,\u201d said Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, whose cooperation is also being sought by the January 6 select committee. \u201cSo, yeah, I think that that would be germane.\u201d Yet both Perry and Jordan have declined to cooperate with the January 6 committee over their communications with the former President and his team in the days leading up to and during the riot. Asked about her views of Jordan wielding a gavel in a GOP majority, Cheney said the Ohio Republican should worry about the situation before him now. \u201cI think that Mr. Jordan\u2019s focus right now ought to be on fulfilling his duties and obligations and coming, appearing in front of the select committee and providing the information that he has as a material witness in discussions that he had on January 6, with Donald Trump and in the activities he was engaged in, in the planning leading up to it,\u201d Cheney said. CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A year after the attack on the US Capitol, homeland security and law enforcement officials nationwide are bracing for potential \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels of violence this year as midterm elections kick into gear and the pandemic continues to affect everyday life. The country remains polarized, and many people are angry and frustrated about their individual selves or society\u2019s conditions after two years of Covid-19 upheaval, turbulent economic conditions and government restrictions, sources and non-governmental researchers told CNN. Late last month in a string of unrelated incidents, a gunman killed five people in the Denver area, a man was stopped on his way to Washington, DC with weapons and a \u201chit list,\u201d and a New Year\u2019s Eve fire at Planned Parenthood facility in Tennessee was declared arson. All these incidents come as officials are already preparing for protests in the nation\u2019s capital later this month. Societal divisions coupled with online and media content that is saturated with conspiracy theories and disinformation has led officials to worry that the levels of violence in 2022 could be \u201cunprecedented,\u201d a federal law enforcement official said. While much attention focused on the January 6 anniversary, \u201cfrom a law enforcement perspective, it goes well beyond that,\u201d the official said. Another concern is that the volatility will only increase as the election cycle progresses and we get closer to the 2022 midterm elections, they added. Fractures in US society and the spread of misinformation are likely to be exacerbated during the election cycle, the official said, pointing out that public figures, such as those running for office, those who hold elected office and those in the media who comment about these issues will only increase their activities. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pleasant forecast,\u201d said Peter Simi, an associate professor at Chapman University who studies extremist groups and violence. \u201cI think we see the threats mounting. And really transitioning into what we might call \u2018an everyday insurgency.\u2019\u201d One year after the January 6 Capitol riot, far-right extremists still contend the 2020 election was stolen, according to recent report from SITE Intelligence Group, a non-governmental organization that tracks online extremist activity. However, these extremist groups have dispersed their focus on various issues, like vaccines, Covid-19 conspiracy theories and Biden administration policies, the report found. \u201cTo be clear, however, the extremist momentum behind January 6 has not diminished \u2013 it has spread in all directions,\u201d SITE director Rita Katz said. That energy has been redirected toward Covid-19 mitigation measures, the migrant crisis at the Southern border, critical race theory and elections, she added. She also pointed to the upcoming Congressional elections, \u201cwhich will be centered on the same hot-button topics these violent extremist actors have pivoted towards.\u201d Ideologies of hate, false information, false narratives are primary sources of the threat landscape in the US today, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told CNN Wednesday. \u201cThe divisiveness in our country is really fueling it as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWords matter. And the words of leaders matter a lot. And that can actually fuel the spread of false information and can drive people to violence.\u201d Conspiracy theories about election fraud, which probably contributed to the breach of the US Capitol last year, continue to resonate among domestic violent extremists, according to a recent DHS intelligence assessment obtained by CNN. Mayorkas told reporters this week that the department is \u201cvery, very focused on the security and integrity of our election processes,\u201d when asked if he was worried about threats connected to the upcoming midterm election cycle. Over the past year, there has been a dramatic uptick of threats made against lawmakers, with 9,600 in 2021 alone, US Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said this week. A senior Capitol security official previously attributed that increase in part to \u201ca more bitter and partisan political environment and citizens for whom the issues that they\u2019re angry about are core value and identity issues.\u201d As always, the problem remains sifting through the noise of angry tweeters versus actual threats, the security official said, adding that the \u201cmajority\u201d of threats don\u2019t \u201crepresent a risk of real violence.\u201d DHS intelligence chief John Cohen told KNX News radio on Wednesday, \u201cWhat keeps me up at night, and I know is keeping up a number of my colleagues around the country, is not just the anniversary of January 6, but the threat environment as we enter 2022.\u201d Cohen pointed to the polarization of US society, as well as efforts from foreign intelligence services, terrorist organizations and domestic extremist thought leaders who seek to exacerbate social tensions, undermine credibility in the US government and inspire violence by planting and spreading online and media content. There continues to be a \u201csteady tempo of mass casualty attacks by angry, disaffected people who are inspired by the content that they\u2019re consuming online,\u201d he said during the interview. Mass casualty incidents, for example, in Denver, Atlanta, Indianapolis over the past year all displayed signs of the volatile threats concerning law enforcement today, with some suspects coming to the attention of law enforcement before they carried out attacks. Last month, a California man was stopped by the Cass County Sheriff\u2019s department in Iowa with a \u201chit list\u201d of people he intended to kill, including Anthony Fauci and Mark Zuckerberg, according to a federal criminal complaint. He had the address of the White House in his GPS and told investigators he would kill President Joe Biden, the complaint said. The suspect\u2019s attorney told the court he intends to rely upon an insanity defense. Mayorkas said that DHS has increased and improved information sharing with local communities over the past year to help counter the threat from domestic terrorism, as well as added local grant funding and established a new, dedicated domestic terrorism branch. Many in law enforcement have been working to ramp up information sharing over the past year. For example, law enforcement officials nationwide were recently able to see there were around 200 threats to schools across the country that had proliferated on TikTok, a law enforcement source said. Vague and viral TikTok warning of school violence is not credible but has schools and law enforcement on high alert \u201cPreviously, we had no capability to see all those threats at the same time, where they were and what type of threats there were,\u201d the source said, pointing to the failures leading up the January 6, 2021. That said, there is still on the federal government side, a \u201clarge disconnect between the many portals that the government manages,\u201d the source said. DHS, FBI and local authorities all manage different systems that are difficult to coordinate, the source added. Last month, Cohen raised concerns about the ability for law enforcement to manage threats across the US. \u201cWe do not yet have, across the United States, a consistent level of capability that is designed to enable threat assessment and threat management activities at the local level,\u201d Cohen said during a George Washington University forum. Mayorkas agreed last week, saying, \u201cWe are in fact, seeing an uneven level of capabilities in local communities.\u201d Neither official mentioned specific communities, but the secretary said the unevenness underscores the importance of information sharing and intelligence sharing among law enforcement and homeland security officials. The suspect in the recent metro Denver shooting spree, for instance, was investigated by Denver police in 2020 and early 2021 but charges were never filed. The gunman \u2013 identified as Lyndon James McLeod, 47, foreshadowed the rampage in a series of books he wrote under a pseudonym, and he used the names of actual victims in his writings, CNN reported. \u201cThis individual was on the radar of law enforcement,\u201d Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen previously said without elaborating. Five people were killed in the shootings and several were wounded, including a policewoman. Without providing specifics, Mayorkas said that in the last several weeks, DHS has seen the benefits of information sharing, in a situation \u201cwhere a particular community was not necessarily as developed in its apparatus, or evolved as others, but nevertheless, through the information we imparted to it, it was able to identify a potential threat before that threat materialized and inform us.\u201d A year after the January 6 Capitol riot, the extremism landscape is \u201call over the map,\u201d Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, told CNN. There are traditional White supremacists, anti-government groups and accelerationists, as well as a \u201csignificant group of folks\u201d that are interested in ISIS and Al Qaeda, he said. The objective of accelerationism is to foment divisiveness and polarization that will induce the collapse of the existing order and spark a civil war, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, which recently wrote about the perils of the movement. The lack of large-scale events similar to the January 6 riot over the past year, is a reflection of a fracturing movement combined with the efforts of law enforcement, according to Hughes. Looking ahead to the election season, Hughes pointed out that while there has been a rise in threats against election officials and public officials, several elections have safely taken place since last January. When it comes to far-right extremism, Simi, the Chapman University professor, told CNN, \u201cWe\u2019ve been asleep at the wheel for a long time,\u201d in part making it difficult for the public to understand the multiple threats facing the US. \u201cPart of that is because it\u2019s an insider threat. It\u2019s easier to point to something from the outside, those that are attacking us from outside,\u201d he said, referencing the terrorism of 9/11.",

            "article_content": "The Biden administration is still weighing exactly how it would penalize Russia if the country invades Ukraine, as US diplomats are just days away from high-stakes meetings with Kremlin officials. Some Biden administration officials are warning of collateral economic damage from harsh sanctions and the risk of retaliatory Russian cyberattacks should the US follow through with President Joe Biden\u2019s promised \u201csevere consequences\u201d on the Russian economy if Russian President Vladimir Putin orders a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At least two analyses done in recent weeks by the Treasury and State departments found that the sanctions that would be most crippling for Russia \u2013 like penalties on the Russian energy giant Gazprom or its Central Bank \u2013 could also damage economies throughout the rest of the world by potentially spiking gas prices or hampering European trade and investment with Russia at a particularly delicate moment for the bloc. One concern is that those negative effects could boomerang back onto the US during an election year, sources told CNN. But others in the administration believe the tough sanctions being weighed would have a manageable impact on the US, and would be worth it to impose severe penalties on Russia. The extent of the blowback would depend largely on the parameters of the sanctions and how much Europe would suffer, said Jeff Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who focuses on international trade policy and economic sanctions. \u201cThe problem with discussing these countermeasures is that if you take a strong sanctions action that has a big impact on the European economy, that will in turn rebound to the US economy,\u201d he said. The administration has been considering options including targeting major Russian commercial banks, sanctioning Russia\u2019s energy sector, blocking Russia\u2019s access to bond markets, cutting Russia off from the SWIFT international payment system, and tightening export control measures. Among the most \u201crealistic\u201d economic penalties that the US and its allies could impose would be to kill the Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, Schott said, which \u2013 when operational \u2013 will account for about 10-15% of European Union gas consumption but will bypass Ukraine and be a major boon to Russia. US officials have been lobbying Germany to commit to killing the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, according to a senior US official, and Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said last month that \u201cin the event of further escalation\u201d against Ukraine, \u201cthis gas pipeline could not come into service.\u201d Officials are also mindful of the possibility of Russian retaliation in cyberspace against US and European critical infrastructure. The potential for such spillover is weighing on how the US responds to any Russian incursion and will also affect how allies react, as the US works to coordinate a response for maximum effect. A senior administration official told CNN that \u201cany costs that we would bear will pale in comparison to the impact we generate on the Russian economy and financial system.\u201d \u201cWhatever we decide, in concert with our allies and partners, is the right course for our collective interests and security, we are prepared to deliver severe costs to the Russian economy while minimizing unwanted spillover,\u201d the senior administration official told CNN. A State Department spokesperson echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that while the department does \u201cnot preview potential sanctions actions,\u201d the US and its allies have been consulting on \u201cspecific packages of severe consequences for Russia should they go forward with military escalation In Ukraine.\u201d \u201cAs Secretary Blinken said, if Russia chooses to escalate, we will respond swiftly,\u201d the spokesperson said. Another scenario top of mind for US and European officials is if Russia moves to retaliate against any sanctions with hacking activity against western critical infrastructure. Recent National Security Council meetings have included discussions of potential Russian cyber activity should tensions with the US escalate further over Ukraine, a senior administration official told CNN. Meanwhile, the White House has overseen federal agencies\u2019 outreach to US companies encouraging them to maintain strong cybersecurity protections, the official said. \u201cWhile there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for Russia to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,\u201d the senior Biden administration official told CNN. The Energy Department in mid-December held an unclassified briefing with America\u2019s biggest electric utilities, natural gas and oil companies on Russia\u2019s history of disruptive cyber operations in Ukraine and other parts of the world, two people who listened to the briefing told CNN. While not tied to any specific threat, the Energy Department briefing covered the technical details of previous Russian cyberattacks that cut power in parts of Ukraine in 2015 and 2016, along with more recent Russian cyber activity such as the 2020 espionage campaign that exploited SolarWinds software, said one of the people who attended the briefing, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private call. The message from US officials to electric utilities and energy operators on the call was to be vigilant and to \u201chave heightened awareness, as you monitor these geopolitical activities, that there could be spillover\u201d in cyberspace, the source told CNN. Jim Linn, executive director of DNG-ISAC, a cyberthreat sharing center for the downstream natural gas industry, told CNN: \u201cEscalating tensions abroad, especially in Eastern Europe, has the potential to alter the cybersecurity landscape.\u201d Linn\u2019s threat-sharing center, he added, \u201cis constantly tracking threats posted by members, government and law enforcement as well as sharing information and mitigation techniques.\u201d A recent classified briefing for key US financial institutions \u2013 conducted by Treasury Department and US intelligence officials and part of their regular cyberthreat briefings for banks \u2013 featured information on Russian cyber capabilities and the possibility of Russian retaliation in cyberspace if things escalate in Ukraine, a cybersecurity executive at a major US bank familiar with the briefings told CNN. With all of the risks to consider, and with Russia showing no signs of withdrawing its forces from the Ukraine border, intensive discussions have been underway in recent days and weeks about how the US and its allies can mitigate the potential collateral damage, sources said. \u201cWe are not backing down from our willingness to impose these kinds of harsh sanctions if Russia moves to invade,\u201d said one official. \u201cBut we still have to figure out how to do them in a way that is smart. How do you craft them in a way that they hit the intended party more than your allies?\u201d Sanctioning members of Putin\u2019s inner circle is still a top option, the first official said, and likely a given if Russia invades because of the more limited impact it would have on the international financial system. The White House and senior officials are also discussing potential export control measures that could halt Russia\u2019s ability to import smartphones, key aircraft and automobile components, and materials from many other sectors, threatening major impacts on Russian consumers, industrial operations, and employment, sources familiar with the discussions said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated in a press conference on Wednesday that if Russia does not commit to \u201cdiplomacy and de-escalation\u201d during talks next week and instead renews its aggression against Ukraine, the Kremlin will incur \u201cmassive consequences\u201d from the US and its allies. Biden conveyed much the same message to Putin in a phone call last week, telling the Russian leader that the costs of an invasion would include economic penalties as well as \u201cadjustments and augmentations of NATO force posture in Allied countries\u201d and \u201cadditional assistance to Ukraine to enable it to further defend itself and its territory,\u201d another senior administration official told reporters.",

            "article_content": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed Wednesday that Russia must de-escalate tensions on the border with Ukraine in order for upcoming diplomatic meetings to succeed, saying \u201cit\u2019s very hard to make actual progress in any of these areas in an atmosphere of escalation and threat, with a gun pointed at Ukraine\u2019s head.\u201d The top US diplomat said the path of \u201cdiplomacy and de-escalation\u201d was one of two the US and international community has laid out for Moscow ahead of a series of meetings aimed at defusing a potential crisis as Russia amasses troops on the border with Ukraine. The other path was that \u201cof deterrence, including the serious costs, the massive consequences it would incur if it renews its aggression against Ukraine,\u201d Blinken said. Blinken made the comments days before a US delegation sits down with Russian representatives in Geneva, the first of three engagements with Russia next week. He said it was \u201cimportant that we begin these conversations,\u201d but \u201cif they\u2019re going to bear fruit, if they\u2019re going to show real progress, that will require de-escalation.\u201d \u201cThe real question is whether Russia is serious about diplomacy, serious about de-escalation,\u201d Blinken said. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Tuesday that the US-Russia talks were expected to focus on a \u201crelatively narrow set of bilateral issues,\u201d while the subsequent meetings at NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will discuss broader issues that impact Europe. Tensions are high on Ukraine's border with Russia. Here's what you need to know White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the US plans to raise a variety of Russian misdeeds, including its invasions of neighboring countries, its use of chemical weapons and its election interference, in the engagements next week. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what next week\u2019s conversations will bring but our approach to the discussions will be pragmatic, results-oriented and we believe there are areas we can make progress on with Moscow, make progress on if they come to the table ready to do that,\u201d she said. Blinken said Wednesday that \u201cif Russia is serious about pursing diplomacy and de-escalation, that there are things that all of us can do relatively quickly to build greater confidence and to reduce some of the concerns that we have.\u201d He did not give specific details about what those confidence building measures could be. \u201cThere are also issues that could be on the table that would take some time to work through, particularly for example when it comes to arms control,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t come up with an arms control agreement in a matter of weeks.\u201d Speaking alongside his German counterpart on Wednesday, Blinken warned that a Russian invasion could mean a shutdown the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany. He noted that the pipeline \u201cdoes not have gas flowing through it at present and if Russia renews its aggression toward Ukraine, it would certainly be difficult to see gas flowing through it in the future.\u201d \u201cSome may see Nord Stream 2 as leverage that Russia can use against Europe; in fact, it\u2019s leverage for Europe to use against Russia,\u201d he said. Blinken also condemned Russia\u2019s \u201cfalse narrative that Ukraine seeks to provoke a conflict with Russia.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s like the fox saying it had no choice to attack the henhouse because somehow the hens presented a threat to it,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden will return to the White House from an abbreviated winter break facing a set of hurdles that will test his political, diplomatic and management skills at a trying moment for his presidency. The raging pandemic, a crisis with Russia and uncertainty surrounding his prized domestic priorities all await Biden in the new year. Determined to reset after a series of struggles \u2013 and to recalibrate expectations that some of his allies believe were unrealistic \u2013 the President is hopeful the coming weeks can provide much-needed momentum as another election cycle dawns. Biden spent much of his time away from Washington over the past week on the phone discussing the days ahead with advisers and others in his extended orbit, plotting next steps in what could prove a pivotal month for his presidential ambitions. That includes preparation for a speech marking next week\u2019s one-year anniversary of the January 6 Capitol riot, a moment that underscores the stakes of his tenure and the strained political environment in which he governs. A pandemic-scarred year ends in darkness -- but with hope on the horizon His team is still regrouping after Sen. Joe Manchin, the moderate West Virginia Democrat, threw the future of his sweeping economic plan into doubt the Sunday before Christmas. In the days after his announcement, which surprised and angered Biden\u2019s aides, Manchin made particular note of his annoyance with White House staff, claiming they undermined the negotiation process and cryptically citing a perceived slight that drove him to his \u201cwit\u2019s end.\u201d Since then, tensions seem to have cooled, though Biden told reporters on Tuesday he hadn\u2019t spoken to Manchin this week. White House officials are hopeful talks can be revived on a more limited bill, or set of bills, in the new year. \u201cPresident Biden, who I have worked for for many years \u2026 has a habit of pulling legislative rabbits out of hats. And has done so many times,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, the president\u2019s top economist, on CNN. \u201cHe is not by any means done fighting for Build Back Better. When I talk to him about that, he has some confidence about that.\u201d Democrats in Congress, who have been left politically vulnerable by retirements and GOP redistricting plans, enter the midterm election cycle eager for Biden and Manchin to strike some kind of accord, even if the final package lacks the ambition of the sweeping social and climate bill the President initially proposed. \u201cI think it is important we pass whatever components we can through Congress and get them signed into law,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois, this week. \u201cIf we do that, we make our own luck and increase the chances of doing better in the midterms and delivering for the American people.\u201d Viewed by the President and his team as a rebuilding year after the tumult of the Donald Trump era, 2021 was marked by a series of challenges that dramatically eroded Biden\u2019s political standing. His approval rating entered negative territory over the summer and has not rebounded since. The sour national mood belies a strong economic record, including the creation of nearly 6 million jobs. New jobless claims fell this week to a 52-year low. Other indicators have shown near-record levels of growth as the economy rebounds from pandemic-era shutdowns. Biden was also able to pass two major pieces of legislation \u2013 a Covid relief package and a massive infrastructure bill \u2013 and successfully rolled out a vaccination campaign to hundreds of millions of Americans, even if a stubbornly large percentage of the country still refuses the shot. Biden and his advisers have been frustrated those achievements were obscured by other challenges, like a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, slogging negotiations among Democrats over the domestic spending bill, supply chain issues, high inflation and the still-raging pandemic. Inflation, explained: Why prices keep going up and who's to blame Unlike some of his predecessors, Biden opted against convening a year-end press conference to discuss the year\u2019s achievements or his priorities for 2022. He sat for one news interview, with ABC, and appeared on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s late-night show, but otherwise left public assessments of his first year to others. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d Biden told Fallon, \u201cwe\u2019ve been in less than a year, a lot has happened. Look, people are afraid, people are worried, and people are getting so much inaccurate information to them. I don\u2019t mean about me, but about their situation. And so they\u2019re, you know, they\u2019re being told that, you know, Armageddon is on the way.\u201d Biden spent two nights at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home after Christmas with members of his extended family and a new German Shepherd puppy, emerging once to walk the dog \u2013 which he received as a birthday gift from his brother \u2013 along the Atlantic. He departed the beach one day earlier than originally planned to return to his main house in Wilmington, which is situated more privately than his oceanfront property. It was from there he spoke by telephone with Vladimir Putin on Thursday, hoping to defuse a crisis on the Ukrainian border. The conversation did not yield much clarity over whether the Russian president plans to invade Ukraine, as the West fears he might. Biden, who spent the preceding days conferring with his secretary of state and national security adviser by telephone, is hopeful diplomatic talks early next month in Europe can help ease the situation. The Ukraine standoff is an opportunity for Biden to repair a foreign policy reputation damaged by a chaotic and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan over the summer, which angered US allies and led to questions about the President\u2019s diplomatic acumen. The administration\u2019s admitted failure to foresee how quickly the Taliban would retake control was one in a roster of items that seemed to catch Biden and his advisers off-guard this year. Other examples included persistent inflation that officials once described as \u201ctransitory,\u201d the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant and a shortage of Covid-19 tests that Biden is now hurriedly working to remedy. The White House is expected to soon unveil details surrounding the rollout of the 500 million free at-home tests Biden promised all Americans last week, though a series of questions about the logistics and capacity of the program remain unanswered. The vaccine mandates he sought to implement will also face the Supreme Court this week. The resurgent coronavirus shadowed the President\u2019s festive season as national case counts rose to record levels this week and strained hospitals in certain areas of the country. Over the Christmas weekend, Biden took notice of long lines at testing centers that aired on television. It was, for Biden, another pandemic-related disappointment in a year that fell short of nearly everyone\u2019s expectations. A July 4 ceremony marking \u201cIndependence from Covid-19\u201d was followed nearly immediately by a surge of the Delta variant. Biden said during a CNN town hall last February that he hoped by the Christmas holidays \u2013 then still 11 months away \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019ll be in a very different circumstance, God willing, than we are today.\u201d \u201cA year from now, I think that there\u2019ll be significantly fewer people having to be socially distanced, having to wear a mask,\u201d he said then \u2013 a goal that, at the time, seemed dully unambitious. The Bidens had once hoped to escape somewhere warmer for the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day, as they usually did before the pandemic. But those plans were abandoned in mid-December, and instead the President\u2019s family requested a Christmas Eve at the White House. Before departing for Delaware, Biden spoke by video link to the nation\u2019s governors and assured them he was standing ready to provide support to states in need, even as he acknowledged shortcomings in his testing strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not enough,\u201d he said after listing which steps he has taken to ramp up test capacity. \u201cIf I had \u2013 we had known, we would have gone harder, quicker if we could have.\u201d At the same time, the White House has begun a concerted shift away from focusing exclusively on case counts as a barometer for the pandemic, hoping to hone in on severity of cases as measured in hospitalizations. A CDC decision this week to halve the number of recommended isolation days post-infection \u2013 driven in part by a desire to keep businesses running as employees become infected \u2013 reflected a response increasingly attuned to living with a virus that shows no signs of disappearing completely. \u201cIf you\u2019re in office, you\u2019re accountable and you\u2019re always going to be subject to criticism. When you manage a pandemic, you\u2019re not running a popularity contest. You\u2019re trying to manage the situation so you minimize the amount of pain as much as possible and allow people to lead their lives,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, who was Biden\u2019s top pandemic adviser earlier in the administration. Still looming in the middle distance is Biden\u2019s first State of the Union, a moment advisers hope to use to define the first year of Biden\u2019s presidency on their own terms. Tentatively set for early February, the speech will also provide a chance to adjust expectations for the coming months. Work has already begun on the outline of the address. It could be Biden\u2019s final address to a Congress controlled in both chambers by Democrats, a matter of urgency if he hopes to pass the major items on his priority list. That includes protections for voting rights, an issue Biden has said has no equal when it comes to preserving American democracy. The coming weeks will prove critical for the push to safeguard access to the ballot, and Biden along with Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 tasked with leading on the issue from within the White House \u2013 are planning a renewed drive to pass stalled pieces of legislation. That includes using the January 6 anniversary to call for greater democratic protections. Civil rights groups have called on Biden to get something done by the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday mid-month. How that is accomplished, however, remains an open question.",

He is a CNN political commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. President Joe Biden and the Democrats have been on a bit of a roll since August \u2013 beginning with the enactment of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act. The law\u2019s impact on inflation will likely be minimal, although the climate change, pharmaceutical price controls and health care provisions are significant and consequential. Meanwhile, gasoline prices, while still high, have fallen, as Biden\u2019s approval rating, while still perilously low, has risen. Democratic victories in competitive special elections in the recent New York and Alaska House races have injected a shot of adrenaline into Democratic candidates across the country. The Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, former President Donald Trump\u2019s unhelpful meddling in the midterm scrum and GOP candidate stumbles \u2013 particularly in swing state Senate races \u2013 have lowered Republican expectations of a massive red wave. Democrats now want to act as if they can defy history and mitigate expected midterm losses \u2013 possibly retaining control of both chambers of Congress. But all of that optimism should be tempered after the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revealed on Tuesday that inflation ticked back up last month. National poll after national poll shows the economy and inflation remain top concerns among voters \u2013 and these latest government figures will not do much to ease voter anxiety. The news is even worse in cities in key swing states \u2013 including Phoenix, Atlanta and Miami, with inflation jumps year over year of 13%, 11.7%, and 10.7%, respectively, according to Axios analysis of BLS data. Meanwhile, as consumers are paying less for gasoline overall, gas prices remain stubbornly high, particularly in Arizona, Nevada and other critical states to the Democrats\u2019 goal of maintaining congressional control. Opinion: Republicans have great ideas. It's time to start talking about them So, what does this all mean for the GOP and its prospects of winning majorities in the House and Senate? No doubt Republicans will continue to hammer Democrats on out-of-control spending, particularly the American Rescue Plan, and how that profligacy has helped to turbocharge inflation at a time when supply was already low and demand quite high. The GOP will also amplify attacks on Democrats over soaring crime rates in Democratic-run cities and states, and the ongoing crisis at the border. Combined with inflation, these are powerful issues to campaign on. But GOP messaging does not occur in a vacuum \u2013 and Republicans need to contend with several major obstacles. First, Democrats will relentlessly pound Republicans over abortion. The GOP never had a coherent plan for victory after the Dobbs decision. Several Republican-controlled states have enacted extreme abortion bans with few or no exceptions. Public reaction has been fierce to these measures, as witnessed by the recent referendum in ruby-red Kansas where abortion rights were affirmed by a wide margin \u2013 providing further evidence that these abortion bills are alienating significant numbers of Republican voters, as well as Democrats and independents. Opinion: What started in Kansas upends American politics Adding to the incoherence is Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\u2019s introduction of national abortion ban legislation after 15 weeks, placing congressional candidates in the uncomfortable position of answering unwanted questions on a highly controversial abortion bill. After the Dobbs ruling, GOP congressional candidates simply wanted to deflect these abortion questions to the states. Second, extreme election-denying GOP candidates are making victory less likely in some critical swing states and districts. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tacitly acknowledged this problem when he recently spoke of candidate quality. At a Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce event he said, \u201cI think there is a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate\u2026Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.\u201d In an era of extreme polarization, candidates may matter less, but candidates still matter. Finally, the GOP must acknowledge the elephant in the room: Trump. Many Republican candidates in competitive races want Trump to go radio silent between now and the midterms. After all, it\u2019s hard to sell a strong anti-inflation or tough-on-crime message when Trump keeps bringing the story back to himself. Witness the recent Trump rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he provided a gift to Democrats by relentlessly attacking the law enforcement agencies responsible for investigating his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.  Indeed, it\u2019s difficult for the GOP to make the midterms a referendum on the Biden administration while Trump, unpopular with many Democrats and independents, is the public face of the GOP. So, two questions remain: Will the GOP message on rising inflation, crime and historical midterm dynamics favoring the party out of power prevail? Or will Trump, abortion and GOP candidate quality mitigate expected Democrat losses? The truth is we have never seen a defeated, unpopular former president play such an outsized role in a midterm election. But Republicans still have a fighting chance. While they cannot control Trump, they can try to ignore him as much as possible between now and November \u2013 focusing instead on their winning messages on the economy and crime. It\u2019s not an ideal situation, but if they succeed in doing so, I expect a very slender GOP House majority in the next Congress. The Senate is a jump ball, but Democrats in the upper chamber still have reason for optimism.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In February 1952, King George VI was found dead in his sleep by a servant delivering his morning tea at the royal retreat at Sandringham. His 25-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became Queen even before she was able to rush home from a trip to Kenya. The nation was saddened by the king\u2019s death, reported Clifton Daniel in the New York Times, but saw the rise of Elizabeth as a good sign: \u201cIt is a tradition that Britain prospers and grows great whenever a queen reigns,\u201d as it had under the first Queen Elizabeth, from 1558 to 1603. Daniel, who later became managing editor of the Times and the son-in-law of former President Harry Truman, observed that the new queen \u201cwas carefully trained from the age of ten for her regal duties.\u201d \u201cShe is a calm and happy young woman who has a capacity for fun and who in her official life displays a rigid sense of duty and discipline and an appreciation for the dignity of her high office,\u201d wrote Daniel. \u201cAs a result of long training and serious application to her job she almost invariably does the right thing \u2013 as rightness is understood in this country.\u201d Remarkably, 70 years later, the Queen, who died Thursday, is being remembered for exactly that quality. \u201cDuty is a rather old-fashioned concept today in a world rife with public figures who hunger only for power to be achieved by any means available,\u201d wrote Peter Bergen. \u201cBut duty is the one word to best summarize the reign of Queen Elizabeth II \u2026 The Queen selflessly gave of herself. Hers was a role that is ceremonial, but it is also deeply embedded in the oldest constitutional monarchy in the world and in a country that has given the world so many of the concepts and policies that we associate with democracy.\u201d But there was more to her enduring role. As Laura Beers wrote, \u201cOn Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s watch, post-war Britain rebuilt itself in the wake of two devastating world wars, and became the modern nation celebrated to such fanfare in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremonies \u2013 an international spectacle in which the Queen gamely played a starring role, alongside Daniel Craig\u2019s James Bond.\u201d \u201cAnd in a country whose recent politics have been defined by increasing polarization and disunity dating back to the Brexit referendum in 2016, if not before, Queen Elizabeth has been one of the few figures capable of uniting the country.\u201d The sense of fun noted by Daniel persisted too. \u201cIn the 1990s, Britpop again put the country on the musical map,\u201d Beers wrote, observing that the Spice Girls\u2019 \u201c1997 photo ops with Prince Charles and the Queen helped to cement the relationship between the monarchy and \u2018Cool Britannia.\u2019\u201d In the Guardian, Caroline Davies wrote of the Queen\u2019s constant presence: \u201cfamiliar in brightly coloured coat, brimmed hat and handbag, she glad-handed her way through \u2018walkabouts\u2019, garden parties, ship launches, plaque unveilings, tree plantings, building inaugurations \u2013 the bread and butter of her engagements diary \u2013 with an inscrutable smile in place\u2026\u201d \u201cShe kept much back. Only those closest knew Elizabeth the wife, mother, grandmother and excellent mimic \u2026 she remained largely an enigma, and will do so until the diaries, which in royal tradition she wrote daily, are made public.\u201d Balmoral Castle, where the Queen died, was one of her favorite places, but Davies noted that \u201cvisitors didn\u2019t always share her enthusiasm\u201d for it. \u201cIt was draughty, and a little threadbare \u2026 but such details fascinated the public: a queen who stored cereal in Tupperware, used a two-bar electric fire for heating, and kept a Big Mouth Billy Bass, a battery-operated fish, on top of her piano, seemed less remote, despite being woken each morning by bagpipes.\u201d Her eldest son, Charles, who was just three years old when his mother ascended the throne in 1952, is now King Charles III. It\u2019s a sudden departure in a nation where more than 85% of the population has known only one monarch, a female one. Maureen Dowd wrote in the New York Times that she had been \u201craised in an Irish family baked in bitterness about British oppression. The monarchy seems like an expensive relic to me, and I think King Charles, on the throne at last at 73, will struggle with a domain in which former colonies may consider dropping him as head of state.\u201d \u201cI always thought of Queen Elizabeth as an avatar of nepotism and colonialism. But as time went on, and victimhood became the fashion, I began to have a creeping admiration for her stoicism.\u201d \u201cThen, in 2011, I covered her fraught trip to Ireland, the first by a British monarch in a century. Suddenly I understood how one small movement of her head could soothe over 800 years of bloodshed and hatred\u2026The queen showed all the empathy and warmth she could not summon when Diana died. By the end of the visit, the Irish had melted. They were calling Elizabeth their \u2018prodigal mother,\u2019 \u2018Liz,\u2019 and some were even waving Union Jacks.\u201d The midterm elections look far more competitive than they did just two months ago, with Democrats energized by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. \u201cMany women are feeling scorned, thanks to a Supreme Court decision in June overturning nearly 50 years of settled law on abortion,\u201d said SE Cupp. \u201cThat spells trouble for many Republican candidates, unsurprisingly. So naturally many of them are shifting the positions they had in their primary campaigns to a softer approach in the general election. It\u2019s not even all that subtle.\u201d For example, \u201cin Arizona, Blake Masters removed language on his campaign website that once said he was \u2019100% pro-life.\u2019\u201d The candidate for US Senate shifted \u201cfrom supporting a national abortion ban to a ban on third-trimester pregnancies.\u201d Oren Cass wrote, \u201cEarlier this summer, a highly unpopular President Joe Biden floundered in the White House. He was facing multiple crises \u2013 Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, crime on America\u2019s streets, record migrant crossings at the southern border, surging gas prices and inflation and stalled economic growth.\u201d \u201cPolls and forecasts pointed to a Republican Party romp in the upcoming midterms. But Republican candidates failed to capitalize on that momentum, and party strategists are beginning to sweat about their likely margin in the House of Representatives and their chances of winning a Senate majority at all.\u201d \u201cCandidates and incumbents don\u2019t decide whether gas prices are going up or down, but one important factor they can control is the agenda they present to voters \u2013 their broad priorities and their actual plans. It\u2019s here that Republicans seem determined to sabotage their own chances, by refusing to say anything at all,\u201d Cass wrote, laying out his own ideas for an agenda for the party. \u201cIn the upcoming election, while not being Democrats still looks pretty good, it may not be enough,\u201d he argued. \u201cSupport families, empower workers and protect kids. America could get behind that.\u201d  While Democrats\u2019 chances to retain control of the Senate have increased, Republicans have gone into recrimination mode, as recent strife between Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rick Scott, who heads the GOP\u2019s Senate campaign arm, demonstrates. McConnell suggested that \u201ccandidate quality\u201d could impair the party\u2019s chance of retaking control of the upper chamber. \u201cAlthough Scott stands by his candidates,\u201d Julian Zelizer wrote, \u201cmany commentators agree with McConnell, arguing that former President Donald Trump has inserted himself in the midterms and endorsed several inexperienced and unfit candidates who are now struggling to pull ahead\u2026\u201d \u201cIt will take a series of major losses that keep Democrats in control of Congress and the White House for Republicans like McConnell to step forward and demand his party take a new approach,\u201d Zelizer observed. \u201cBut until it\u2019s clear that Trump is a dead weight dragging the GOP down, we won\u2019t hear more than an occasional gripe from Republicans like McConnell.\u201d For more: SE Cupp: Fetterman is getting a pass in the Pennsylvania Senate race Dean Obeidallah: Trump\u2019s incendiary speech proved President Biden was right A recent report carried a sobering message, as Jill Filipovic noted. \u201cOur school children have suffered unprecedented learning losses, with 9-year-olds seeming to have lost some two decades worth of progress on math and reading skills, according to new test results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\u201d Filipovic added that \u201cthis should make the progressive-minded among us who supported school closures pause and ask ourselves if we got this one right \u2013 and what we could learn from this whole debacle\u2026\u201d \u201cShutting down schools in the spring of 2020 made sense. Covid-19 was a new disease, and we initially knew precious little about who might be particularly vulnerable, and how it might impact children. But by the fall of 2020, when we knew much more, the US remained a global outlier in keeping schools shuttered \u2026 Liberals can win on education. But we have to get in the fight. And to do that, we must first admit that improving our nation\u2019s badly damaged educational outcomes is a battle worth fighting.\u201d In the Wall Street Journal, Kimberly Strassel argued that education is a key issue Republicans can run on this fall. \u201cThe GOP is rightly focused on the economy, but it will need more to keep suburban and swing voters on its side in the face of Democratic scaremongering over abortion and Joe Biden speeches about \u2018semifascist\u2019 Republicans. Education is the powerful rejoinder, a reminder that conservative candidates are the ones who have all along been on the side of parents and common sense \u2026 Any Republican who isn\u2019t making criticism of failed Covid education decisions \u2013 and promises of school choice and parental involvement \u2013 a lead message is committing an election foul.\u201d For more: Sophia Nelson: We are not OK post-Covid Russia turned off the tap. As David A. Andelman noted, the Kremlin stopped the flow of natural gas to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, saying it won\u2019t resume until the West relents on sanctions it has imposed on Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThere\u2019s no other name for this than extortion,\u201d Andelman wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad idea in the short run for Europe and in the long run for Russia\u2026\u201d \u201cA strong will is essential at the ballot box and in ministries and parliaments across the continent.\u201d Russian President Vladimir \u201cPutin has substantial support in some still-isolated quarters. There must be an equally profound understanding by the West of how steep the price would be for any retrenchment in the face of Russian bluster.\u201d Former President Donald Trump won a court victory Monday when US District Court Judge Aileen Cannon granted his request \u201cfor a special master to review documents the FBI seized last month at his Mar-a-Lago resort,\u201d wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers. The judge \u201calso enjoined the FBI and the Department of Justice from reviewing or using those documents in its criminal investigation.\u201d \u201cCannon had previewed this result \u2013 both with her questions and statements at Thursday\u2019s hearing \u2013 as well as in her initial scheduling order before the Justice Department even had an opportunity to be heard. But when it arrived, the judge\u2019s written order struck many legal experts, including me, as being extremely weak in its legal analysis.\u201d Frida Ghitis wrote that \u201cthe latest reporting from the Washington Post, that Trump kept super-secret information about another country\u2019s nuclear capacity\u201d at Mar-a-Lago \u201chighlights just how much risk Trump\u2019s mishandling of classified documents has potentially created, not just for the United States but also for other countries \u2013 and possibly for the rest of the world.\u201d For more: Ted Gup: What\u2019s really at stake when top secrets are stored at Mar-a-Lago? There are tens of millions of pieces of space junk orbiting Earth \u2013 \u201canything from dead satellites \u2026 to pieces of metal, screws or flecks of paint\u201d \u2013 wrote self-described space environmentalist Moriba Jah. \u201cUntil now, space has been seen as a free-for-all \u2013 the next frontier to explore. But what we forget is that it\u2019s also an ecosystem \u2013 and like any ecosystem, exploration of it has come at an environmental cost. Even the tiniest speck of debris, orbiting at around 15,700 miles per hour, can damage satellites and disrupt the services that have become essential to our daily lives. Even worse, large pieces of debris can fall from the sky and crash on Earth.\u201d Governments are developing plans for debris removal, but Jah argued that individuals need to sign onto the effort too: \u201cEveryone needs to understand that what we do in one location on Earth influences our oceans, our air and yes, space. And we need to act accordingly.\u201d Historic flooding has left a third of Pakistan underwater. \u201cIf indeed it is global warming that is causing or even simply aggravating these extreme weather events, as scientists generally concur,\u201d wrote Paul Hockenos, \u201cthen the South\u2019s ever angrier nations are completely justified in their demands that the world\u2019s wealthier regions \u2013 those ultimately responsible for this made-in-the-developed-world crisis \u2013 pay for its losses. In particular, the historically largest emissions sinners \u2013 the United States and Europe.\u201d \u201cBut these poorer countries shouldn\u2019t count on it because not only is most of the Global North in denial about its oversized role in creating the crisis \u2013 it is dead set against condoning the principle of liability.\u201d \u201cThe grim images of washed away houses, stranded refugees, children and elderly people in rushing floodwaters vividly underscore the gross inequities of the crisis that are reverberating across the Global South,\u201d Hockenos noted. The people of California are living through the state\u2019s driest year on record thus far and enduring periods of extreme heat. For Christian Vescia, who lives in San Carlos, it was hard to \u201cjustify using the hundreds of gallons of water required to maintain the three lawns we have on our property.\u201d While he is looking forward to his upcoming retirement, anticipating \u201ccooking big meals, having friends over and dining al fresco on my back patio,\u201d it will happen in a garden \u201cnow almost entirely free of grass.\u201d He replaced his front lawn with \u201ca ground cover called kurapia that is drought tolerant and uses significantly less water than a traditional lawn \u2013 as much as 80% less according to some studies,\u201d Vescia wrote. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve made the switch, I love the fact that I don\u2019t have to stalk back and forth across the lawn every two weeks behind a noisy mower. Most of all, I feel good about using less of our precious water resources.\u201d Sunday marks the 21st anniversary of the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans in New York, Washington, DC, and Shanksville, Pa. In the Washington Post, David Von Drehle wrote that even the killing of terrorist leader Ayman al-Zawahiri this summer won\u2019t bring the struggle with terrorist groups to an end. \u201cThough the American public is tired of war, and the United States\u2019 leaders prefer to act as if it is all over, American warriors must continue to fight because our enemies still have a vote. As another 9/11 anniversary comes and goes, we owe it to those warriors to remember them, to care for them, and to honor their sacrifices of body and soul.\u201d In front of a blazing fire at Balmoral, two days before Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death, she carried out her constitutional duty of meeting and officially appointing the new UK prime minister, Liz Truss. As Rosa Prince wrote, Britain today is feeling a lot like 1979, when Margaret Thatcher won the nation\u2019s top office. \u201cIn 2022, it is as if the country itself is twisting into a shape Thatcher would recognize. The supporting characters are all playing their parts: union leaders souring industrial relations, Russia sowing discord and inflation spiraling to a degree not seen since the 1970s. \u201cThere can be no denying that this new prime minister inherits a set of political circumstances more akin to those in play when Thatcher first came to office in 1979 than that facing anyone else who entered Number 10 in the intervening years.\u201d \u201cWhat is perhaps most striking is not so much the similarity of Truss and Thatcher\u2019s views \u2013 the medicine they believe a sick Britain must swallow to cure the public finances (and only time will tell if the patient\u2019s recovery is swift) \u2013 as it is the determination with which they hold those views,\u201d Prince noted.

Childs. The portraits hadn\u2019t been publicly seen before the ceremony and even the identities of the artists were secret. As it turned out, Childs wrote, \u201cThe paintings are stunning\u2026\u201d Hyperrealist painter Robert McCurdy \u201ctreated Obama in his iconic style, meticulously rendered on a stark white background. No desk, flag, or family portraits to set the presidential scene. Just Obama in minute detail. Obama joked that McCurdy would not even reduce the size of his ears for the portrait. What appealed to the former president was McCurdy\u2019s honesty and ability to render him in all of his humanity.\u201d \u201cSharon Sprung captured the sophisticated and fashionable Michelle Obama. In what is reminiscent of a Gilded Age society portrait, Obama is pictured in a celestial blue Jason Wu gown. Seated on a red couch in front of a pale peach colored background, the artist uses large fields of warm reds in the background and a soft treatment of the figure to produce a romantic depiction of the former first lady.\u201d \u201cIn light of the many Americans who have been and will be emotionally, culturally and politically invested in their story and their legacy, the Obamas have beautifully and carefully crafted how they will be represented in the people\u2019s house.\u201d",

Recent Democratic rhetoric and the longer history of Congress and midterm elections remind us that parties on their way to losing congressional majorities often talk the following way about their legislative agendas: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York declared last week that the party-line passage of the Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act \u201cwill endure as one of the greatest legislative feats in decades\u201d and that the current Congress has had \u201cone of the most productive stretches in recent Senate history.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s pollster, John Anzalone, told Politico that \u201cwe\u2019re on the offensive\u201d and that the Democrats\u2019 spending bills would boost them in the midterm elections. But experience suggests that these kinds of congressional activities do little to change the trajectory of midterm elections. In 2017 and 2018, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, they enacted a string of legislative victories \u2013 despite Democratic resistance. Included were Department of Veterans Affairs personnel reform, a farm bill, a water infrastructure bill, an aviation bill, a NASA modernization bill, an opioid treatment bill, music digital copyright reform, the First Step Act criminal sentences reform and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reconciliation bill. Two new Supreme Court justices were also confirmed during that time. But neither those legislative achievements nor the strong economy was sufficient to enable Republicans to hold the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. They did maintain a narrow majority in the Senate. Mitch McConnell just made the 2022 election about Trump's political future Looking further back to 1977 and 1978, during Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency, when the problems of inflation and high energy prices resembled the current administration\u2019s woes, Democrats also controlled both houses of Congress. During that time, they and the Carter administration established the Department of Energy, the Office of Personnel Management and the Federal Labor Relations Authority. They also reorganized the civil service, enacted new natural gas regulations, a trade bill, airline deregulation and approved the Panama Canal Treaty. Yet in the 1978 midterm elections, with a President whose approval rating was at 49%, the Democrats lost 15 House seats and three Senate seats. Today, Democrats again control both houses of Congress and the White House. They are touting this Congress\u2019 legislative enactments, nearly all of which involve massive federal spending \u2013 a Covid-19 bill, an infrastructure bill, a semiconductors bill, a veterans health bill and the Inflation Reduction Act. The Senate also confirmed one Supreme Court justice. None of these seems likely to be historically consequential in policy terms, but they are record-breaking in the size of their spending and have contributed to inflation. The result is a worsening US economy that has already contracted for at least six months. Veggie tray or crudit\u00e9s? Why Democrats' chances are looking up It seems fair to suggest that in terms of legislative enactments, Schumer can reasonably be compared to Sen. Robert Byrd, the majority leader in 1978. Each used their position to enact a modest number of bills that expanded the size and reach of the federal government. So, will today\u2019s legislative acts boost their chances in the looming midterm elections as the nation struggles with record-high inflation and energy prices, and with a President even less popular than Carter was? History suggests the answer is no. The passage of the far more consequential Obamacare bill in 2010 did not forestall Democrats losing 63 House seats and six Senate seats that year. And it is perhaps a telling statement about today\u2019s politics that recent legislation has had virtually no impact on Americans\u2019 everyday concerns: gas and food prices, real estate or rent costs, increase in crime, illegal crossings at the Mexican border and the educational impact of remote schooling from Covid-19 lockdowns. Today, the public remains sour on the Biden economy, and, by proxy, his party, despite all the spending hype.  But every election has unique factors of its own. No former President \u2013 since Theodore Roosevelt toyed with running for the 1920 Republican presidential nomination \u2013 has loomed so large over a midterm election as Donald Trump has. Democrats will also attempt to drive up turnout \u2013 which tends to sag in midterms \u2013 by leveraging key issues of the moment. They will emphasize culture war concerns (abortion rights and gun control) to their advantage with certain groups of voters. Schumer \u2013 an experienced and savvy politician \u2013 knows that in past years Congress passing more bills has not been sufficient to overcome public dissatisfaction with a President. But whether he and his party can do anything else to overcome Biden\u2019s unpopularity is anything but clear. Many pundits are forecasting a repeat of the historical pattern for one or both houses of Congress. But we could be surprised. Maybe this year will stand out from past examples. It is good to recall the words of famous college basketball coach Adolph Rupp, who said, \u201cThat is why we play the game, to see who wins.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Norman Eisen is a senior fellow at Brookings, a CNN legal analyst and the author of\u202f \u201cTrump on Trial,\u201d a guide to the January 6 committee hearings. Dennis Aftergut, a former federal prosecutor, is currently of counsel to Lawyers Defending American Democracy. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion at CNN. With Steve Bannon set to go on trial July 18 for criminal contempt over defying a congressional subpoena, he is now trying a desperate ploy in connivance with his ally Donald Trump. The former President has sent a letter waiving the purported executive privilege that Bannon cited in stiffing the January 6 committee in October. The committee, the court and the public should not fall for the withdrawal of a nonexistent privilege \u2013 and so far, they don\u2019t seem to be doing so. The Bannon trial must proceed. Bannon was Trump\u2019s chief strategist in the first months of the administration until Trump fired him in August 2017. Bannon continued supporting Trump outside the White House to the point that Trump pardoned Bannon in January 2021. (Bannon had been indicted on charges he defrauded donors as part of a fundraising campaign purportedly aimed at supporting Trump\u2019s border wall, but he hadn\u2019t gone to trial yet. He had pleaded not guilty.) Bannon reportedly was deeply involved with Trump in the events leading up to January 6, 2021. According to \u201cPeril,\u201d Bob Woodward and Robert Costa\u2019s book on Trump, on December 30, 2020, Bannon called Trump, who was at Mar-a-Lago, and said the President needed to get back to Washington and focus his efforts on January 6. Bannon\u2019s vision was to \u201ckill the Biden presidency in the crib\u201d by clouding the election certification process and raising questions about Joe Biden\u2019s election. During the week of January 6, Bannon occasionally joined Rudy Giuliani and lawyer John Eastman in the Willard hotel \u201ccommand center,\u201d The Washington Post reported, set up to assist with overturning the election results. Then, on January 5, Bannon told his \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast audience that \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d No wonder the January 6 committee subpoenaed him. After he failed to appear on October 14, 2021, Congress referred him to the Justice Department for prosecution. He was indicted on two counts of contempt of Congress four weeks later. He faces up to a year of imprisonment and up to a $100,000 fine on each count. He has pleaded not guilty. That brings us to the present moment. Trump wrote Bannon a July 9 letter stating that he was withdrawing his original invocation of executive privilege, having \u201cwatched how unfairly you and others have been treated.\u201d Bannon\u2019s attorney quickly wrote the committee with his client\u2019s offer \u201cto testify at your public hearing.\u201d Federal judge says trial for Steve Bannon will go on next week This new and carefully staged Trump-Bannon dance is pure pretext. Even if Trump could have invoked the privilege as to some others (and that is doubtful), it would not have applied to Bannon. At the time of the events the committee wants to ask about in late 2020 and early 2021, Bannon had long since left the government. Perhaps that is why \u2013 according to Justin Clark, Trump\u2019s own lawyer \u2013 Trump did not try to assert executive privilege back when it mattered, according to the Justice Department. Bannon cannot now mitigate or undo his October defiance based upon Trump\u2019s after-the-fact letter. \u201cPurging\u201d of criminal contempt \u2013 that is, tardy compliance \u2013 cannot block a prosecution once commenced. As prosecutors explain in their new motion, the primary aim of a criminal contempt action is to vindicate the court\u2019s authority and to punish for fully completed disobedience. Think about it: If contempt defendants could always shut down their prosecution by changing their minds months after a wrongdoing and on the eve of trial, subpoenas would be a joke, and investigations would be a shambles. No one would ever comply with a subpoena in a timely fashion. According to The Washington Post, US District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, seems to have crippled that strategy by ruling that \u201cBannon could not argue that he thought he was protected by executive privilege.\u201d The Justice Department had objected to Bannon\u2019s last-minute effort to delay the trial, revealing testimony from Trump lawyer Clark that the former President had not even asserted the privilege concerning Bannon back when he was supposed to testify and turn over documents. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that the committee should ignore Bannon. It should test his offer. We\u2019ll soon know if Bannon is merely offering \u201cpublic hearing\u201d testimony on his own terms the way that GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama offered last month without a willingness to be deposed in advance. The committee should reject as a nonstarter any offer that excludes an advance deposition. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat on the committee, has indicated as much. No sensible congressional investigation wastes the public\u2019s time on witnesses without a thorough pre-hearing vetting of what they have to say. Steve Bannon tries to shield himself with 'podcaster privilege' Negotiating to an impasse on his testimony may be just what Bannon wants here. He can then try to exploit the public\u2019s limited understanding of why depositions are necessary \u2013 and loudly broadcast that the committee never wanted to hear from him in the first place. Of course, if Bannon agrees to be deposed without any conditions, that is a different matter altogether. But the committee should not agree in advance to make any recommendation for leniency to the Justice Department or court unless Bannon tells the whole truth. In all likelihood, and based on his prior statements about the election, that is not Bannon\u2019s intent. We hope to be proven wrong, but if his deposition happens, he will almost certainly fill it with election denial and other extraneous defenses that Trump would love to insert into the proceedings. When the committee refuses to give him a public forum to air those defenses, Bannon would bash it as disinterested in the truth. That would succeed in providing Bannon and Trump with something new to complain about \u2013 to try to muddy up both the committee hearings and the former\u2019s trial.  Nevertheless, the committee should now negotiate with Bannon to determine whether, remote a prospect as it seems, he is actually ready to provide useful information. At the same time, the prosecutors and the court must keep moving forward resolutely if \u2013 as is likely \u2013 Bannon and his patron are playing games. Truth is the only answer to these kinds of manipulations.",

His new paperback is \u201cThe Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World\u201d, from which this essay is adapted. View more opinion on CNN. On January 20, 2021, Donald Trump departed the White House on a helicopter that took him to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where he delivered the final remarks of his presidency to some of his supporters. Before boarding Air Force One for the flight to Mar-a-Lago, his gilded palace in Florida, Trump promised them, \u201cWe will be back in some form.\u201d Some Americans took that as an exciting promise; others took it as more of a threat. Either way, Trump is, indeed, back. A CNN poll released in February found that among Republican voters who were considering candidates for the 2024 presidential race, 54% supported Trump, which made him the top choice for securing the party\u2019s nomination. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis polled second at 21%, while other possible candidates such as former Vice President Mike Pence polled at no more than 1%. There is a strong possibility that Trump will win his party\u2019s nomination should he run again, which seems as likely as warm weather at Mar-a-Lago this summer. Also, should he be nominated, Trump could even win the general election since only 39% of Americans approve of President Joe Biden\u2019s performance in office, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Research poll released earlier this month. Opinion: Trump and Biden were both foolish about Afghanistan. Now we're all paying the price Given Trump\u2019s dominance of the GOP going into 2024, it\u2019s a propitious moment to assess his failures and successes as commander in chief, which I attempt to do in my book, \u201cThe Cost of Chaos, The Trump Administration and the World.\u201d Trump has the distinction of being the only US president who publicly and consistently refused to accept his electoral loss. His lies about the 2020 election have poisoned America\u2019s politics for the foreseeable future, as Trump has made signing on to those lies a de facto litmus test for many Republican candidates running for office. Meanwhile, the bravery of the Ukrainians now fighting the Russians underlines the idiocy of Trump\u2019s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin and also of his efforts to hold back military aid to the Ukrainians. And when Trump was confronted by a real crisis \u2013 the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 he largely embraced wishful thinking and quackery over any real leadership of the nation, resulting in much unnecessary further suffering. But before examining in more detail Trump\u2019s many failures as President, it\u2019s worth stipulating that Trump also had some successes. Trump got one big foreign policy issue mostly right, which was China. While the United States was distracted by its post-9/11 wars, China made great advances economically and militarily \u2013 in part, by stealing American secrets through cyber espionage. Opinion: Biden shouldn't confuse Taiwan with Ukraine The Trump administration correctly identified China as a strategic US rival. This was an important conceptual shift because previous administrations had emphasized US engagement with the Chinese, believing that they would play by the rules of the international system and liberalize their economy and then, as they prospered, they would also liberalize their authoritarian form of governance. As it turned out, that was a fantasy that the Trump administration correctly called out. Trump\u2019s 2017 national security strategy asserted that the Chinese were \u201cbuilding the most capable and well-funded military in the world, after our own.\u201d The Trump strategy also warned that Chinese \u201cland reclamation projects and militarization of the South China Sea flouts international law, threatens the free flow of trade, and undermines stability.\u201d As a result, the Trump administration authorized at least double the number of US Navy ships transiting the South China Sea performing \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises. Also, the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d saved many lives during the pandemic. Under it, the US invested $2.5 billion in Moderna, which produced a testable vaccine on humans in only two months using novel mRNA technology. Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech didn\u2019t take US government funding, but the government placed a $1.95 billion order for 100 million doses, and in doing so guaranteed demand for its vaccine. After the first clinical trials, both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna produced vaccines that were more than 90% effective, an efficacy that eventually waned. These were astonishing results given that the US Food and Drug Administration had put its threshold for approval for any vaccine at 50% effective or above. 'Schizophrenic nature': Dr. Birx describes what it was like working in Trump's White House Trump also presided over the destruction of the ISIS geographical \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Iraq and Syria. Trump was largely following the battle plan that the administration of President Barack Obama had waged to defeat ISIS, but it was during Trump\u2019s presidency that ISIS was finally defeated. And Trump ordered the Special Operations raid in 2019 during which Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS, died. But so many other of Trump\u2019s actions as commander in chief were spectacular failures. The seizure of Afghanistan by the Taliban last year was one of Trump\u2019s most disastrous foreign policy legacies. Biden certainly deserves blame for claiming that he was bound by Trump\u2019s 2020 \u201cpeace\u201d deal with the Taliban, which really was a \u201csurrender agreement\u201d to the Taliban in the mordant words of H.R. McMaster, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. And Biden also deserves blame for the botched execution of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer. But it was Trump, not Biden, who had laid the groundwork for the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. In 2018 Trump authorized his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to begin negotiations with the Taliban, an effort that was led by US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad. Khalilzad made an agreement with the Taliban that, in exchange for a total US withdrawal from Afghanistan, they would break with al-Qaeda and engage in genuine peace talks with the Afghan government. The Taliban simply ignored those agreements. Trump often asserted he was as a great deal maker, but his administration\u2019s agreement with the Taliban was one of the worst deals in American diplomatic history. The Taliban received everything that they wanted without offering anything substantive in return, other than an agreement not to attack US forces as they withdrew from Afghanistan. Since the Taliban\u2019s main goal in their negotiations with the US was a total American withdrawal, this was an easy concession for the Taliban to make. Trump's defense secretary opposed 'precipitous' Afghanistan withdrawal And so it went with many other of Trump\u2019s foreign policy initiatives. He apparently believed that by dint of his personal charm he could persuade the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un, to give up his nuclear weapons. American Presidents going back to Bill Clinton had tried to persuade the nuclear-armed hermit state to rein in its nuclear weapons program, and all of them had failed. While he was President, Trump met with Kim three times, first in Singapore in 2018, a year later in Hanoi and then at the border between North and South Korea. Those meetings generated intense media frenzies and gave Kim and the US President equal billing on the world stage, which was a huge coup for the dictator of a country whose GDP was around the size of the state of Vermont. At the Singapore meeting, Trump unilaterally gave a key concession to Kim \u2013 canceling joint US-South Korea military exercises, which were a longtime cornerstone of containing the North Korean rogue state \u2013 and got nothing in return. Trump and Kim also exchanged 27 letters, some of which had the ardent tone of suitors writing each other. Trump publicly described the missives as \u201clove letters.\u201d Yet, these summits and exchanges of letters yielded nothing. While Trump was in office the North Koreans continued producing fissile material and tested short range ballistic missiles in contravention of UN Security Council prohibitions. They also developed hard-to-detect submarine-launched missiles. Trump\u2019s efforts to constrain North Korea\u2019s nuclear program failed, while his erratic diplomacy encouraged Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Trump regularly castigated Obama\u2019s 2015 nuclear agreement with the Iranians as the \u201cworst deal ever.\u201d But unlike Trump\u2019s peace agreement with the Taliban, the Iranians were observing their end of the nuclear deal. Trump\u2019s own intelligence agencies concluded that the Iranians were adhering to the terms of the 2015 deal. Yet, Trump was determined to get out of Obama\u2019s Iran agreement, which he did in 2018. Opinion: It's time Russia and NATO stop playing games with nuclear war As a result, by the time Trump left office in January 2021, the Iranians were planning to enrich uranium up to 20% purity, far above the 4% purity agreed to in their deal with the Obama administration, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. While this was well short of the 90% purity needed for a nuclear bomb, the Iranian nuclear program took a large step forward as a result of Trump\u2019s ham-handed approach to the Iranians. Throughout his presidency, Trump embraced Putin, while regularly taking pot shots at key American allies such as the British, French and Germans. What was the strategic benefit to the US of all this geopolitical trumpery? It was never clear, although it was certainly a key aim of Putin\u2019s to weaken the NATO alliance, which Trump\u2019s own Defense Secretary, Jim Mattis, described as the most successful alliance in modern history. The importance of that alliance was underlined when Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The Ukrainian military, trained by NATO advisers, imposed huge costs on the Russian invaders, and the Biden administration together with its NATO allies transferred large numbers of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to the Ukrainians. Trump\u2019s affinity with dictators overseas \u2013 a key part of his foreign policy \u2013 dovetailed with his attempts to undermine democratic processes and norms at home, best exemplified by his continued refusal to accede to the will of the people in the 2020 presidential election and his support for his followers, who stormed the US Capitol days before Biden\u2019s inauguration. Trump\u2019s antidemocratic stance \u2013 which he still promotes with the \u201cBig Lie\u201d conspiracy theory \u2013 has poisoned American politics. Opinion: Georgia signals that Trump's days playing kingmaker are over In part because of Trump\u2019s anti-democratic tendencies, during his presidency current and former senior military leaders issued more than 250 public statements that were critical of Trump\u2019s leadership, according to a tally by New America, the research institution where I serve as a vice president. This was unprecedented, as military leaders, both those in uniform and in retirement, generally stay out of politics. Following the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, Trump threatened to send the federal military to quell the unrest that was roiling American cities. On a call about the protests with the nation\u2019s governors on June 1, Trump told them, \u201cIf you don\u2019t dominate, you\u2019re wasting your time. They\u2019re going to run all over you, you\u2019ll look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d Later that evening protesters gathered outside the White House and were met with violence when Trump walked to St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church wielding a Bible, which resulted in a now-infamous photo op. Mattis broke his long silence about Trump, issuing a blistering statement: \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort.\u201d The events of January 6, 2021, further turned the leaders of the US military against Trump. On that day a crowd of many thousands of his supporters gathered outside the White House \u2013 some wearing body armor and many wearing quasi-military outfits. To the assembled crowd Trump spouted a geyser of baseless conspiracy theories about his loss in the presidential election. Trump then urged them to go to the Capitol. A mob then assaulted the building. That evening, Trump was unrepentant about the mayhem he had helped to foment, tweeting: \u201cThese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\u201d This tweet was later deleted. Twitter then suspended Trump from its platform. CNN report: 2020 election still the big motivator for many GOP voters The service chiefs of all the branches of the military \u2013 led by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley \u2013 took the extraordinary measure of sending a joint letter to the 2 million members of the active-duty, National Guard and Reserve units of the US military decrying the insurrection and confirming that \u201cPresident-elect Biden will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief.\u201d The message was clear: The US military would not be assisting Trump in any of his efforts to mount a coup against the Constitution they had sworn an oath to serve. The assault on the Capitol triggered Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial. He was once again acquitted by the Senate, but he now had the distinction of being the only American President to be impeached twice. It was, above all, in his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic that Trump revealed his many weaknesses as a leader. First, he never did any homework, meaning his understanding of complex issues, such as how best to mitigate a pandemic, was always cartoonish. Related to Trump\u2019s first failing was his second: He always believed he knew more than the experts about any given subject. Third, Trump always trusted his own gut. This was not likely to produce relevant knowledge or coherent policy. And it didn\u2019t. Trump had a lot to say publicly about the coronavirus, a great deal of it misleading or simply false, and he also modeled and even encouraged irresponsible behavior. Before effective vaccines, there were two tools that worked to stop the spread of the virus; they were social distancing and wearing a mask in public. Trump denigrated mask-wearing and he also hosted events at the White House with large numbers of attendees socializing without masks, such as the celebration of Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court on October 26, 2020. 'Not much': Trump asked what he'd do differently on Covid-19 response As Americans first became aware of the threat from the coronavirus, Trump said on February 26, 2020, that cases of the virus would go down to zero \u201cwithin a couple of days.\u201d He also wrongfully claimed that the coronavirus was no more dangerous than the seasonal flu. In the first phase of the pandemic, the federal government abdicated its role by not issuing a national shutdown order and a mandate to wear masks. In late April 2020, Trump suggested that injecting bleach might prove to be a treatment for the virus. A month later Trump said that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, was likely a \u201cgame changer.\u201d In June 2020, the FDA revoked \u201cemergency use\u201d of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients because it could cause heart problems. Even when Trump had the chance to make a public statement that really might have made a difference to the scope of the pandemic, he failed to do so. He and his wife, Melania Trump, were vaccinated at the White House during the closing days of his presidency. Any leader with the slightest regard for his own people would have allowed the media to cover this event, especially given the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in the country. Trump chose instead to be vaccinated in secret. His weak leadership produced grave results: More than 400,000 Americans died from Covid-19 during Trump\u2019s final year in office, which was more than the death toll of all the Americans who had died in wars going back to World War II. Many of those deaths could have been avoided with better leadership; Covid mortality in the US was 40% higher than the average of other advanced nations such as Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, according to a report from the medical journal The Lancet.  Dr. Deborah Birx, Trump\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, told a congressional committee in October that \u201cwe probably could have decreased fatalities into the 30-percent-less to 40-percent-less range.\u201d The first duty of the commander in chief is the protection of US citizens, and Trump clearly was derelict in this duty. In short, Trump was the most incompetent President in modern American history.",

When the celebrity inside the Jack in the Box costume was revealed Wednesday on the Fox show \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d he wasn\u2019t Joe Pesci, Robert Duvall, Elon Musk or Al Roker, as the judges had guessed. Instead, to the consternation of many including some of the judges, the man who sang the 1982 hit \u201cBad to the Bone\u201d was former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in the news most recently for his extreme efforts to support former President Donald Trump\u2019s false election fraud narrative. As the Daily Beast asked, \u201cWhat did we do to deserve this?\u201d The farcical moment punctuated a week of unmasking \u2014 not just on the show, but across the country. Protection was the goal in January 2021 when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced masks would be required for passengers on airplanes and public transit. But on Monday, soon after a federal judge struck down the transportation mask mandate, airlines dropped their requirements and many passengers dropped their masks. Those strips of fabric helped protect millions of passengers from Covid-19, but they couldn\u2019t mask the divisions in America that seem wider than ever in the third year of the pandemic. Instead masks have become cultural symbols and personal statements that loom large in a country where lockdowns have loosened the personal ties between us. That the decision against the mask mandate came from a federal judge in Florida who was appointed by Trump \u2014 and rated \u201cnot qualified\u201d by the American Bar Association \u2014 wasn\u2019t lost on critics of the ruling. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle\u2019s decision, Jill Filipovic wrote, \u201cseems to usurp public health guidance while failing to understand science or the English language. The federal government, she held, is only authorized to deal with issues concerning \u2018sanitation,\u2019 which she determined is limited to \u2018measures that clean something.\u2019 Because wearing a mask doesn\u2019t clean anything, she wrote, mask mandates are beyond the scope of the government\u2019s authority.\u201d \u201cAll of this is incredibly dangerous: A right-wing judge doesn\u2019t like a government regulation, and so she voids it on incredibly specious grounds,\u201d Filipovic wrote. Infectious disease expert Dr. Kent Sepkowitz argued that it would be prudent to keep the mask mandate in place given the continued spread of the coronavirus but also noted the tension it causes in the air. On a plane, he wrote, \u201cNothing is private; everything is shared \u2014 even the filtered air. Out of deference to those around us, we stifle our whining to airline staff, minimize our scoots past neighbors for a stroll in the aisle, resist doing jumping jacks or \u2014 most especially \u2014 try our very best to avoid coughing, because all of this can affect others in our little inescapable airplane community.\u201d \u201cThis communal living, however brief, is unpleasant for everyone. Adding to it a mask mandate\u2026 appears to have tipped a segment of the \u2018I am the boss of me; government be gone!\u2019 zealots of the mask and vaccine resistance into a fierce, and even violent, uncivil disobedience. The trend is bad enough to have caught the attention of the Federal Aviation Administration and, for some particularly unruly passengers, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2026 the FAA had 1,150 reports of unruly passengers, from which 744 were related to mask-wearing.\u201d Some experts question how effective the mask mandates really are. In The New York Times, David Leonhardt wrote, \u201cUnfortunately, the U.S. has spent much of the past two years with the worst of all worlds on masks. People have been required to wear them for hours on end, causing frustration and exhaustion and exacerbating political polarization. Yet the rules have included enough exceptions to let Covid spread anyway. The burden of the mandates has been relatively high, while the benefits have been relatively low. It\u2019s the opposite of what a successful public health campaign typically does.\u201d In high school, Danielle McLean played on the boys varsity hockey team. Weakened by chemotherapy for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, McLean wrote, \u201cI could only last a single, one-minute shift during each three-period game before the muscles in my legs began to feel as if they were pushing through my skin,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut during those brief few minutes of playing time, I felt free, whole \u2014 as if my troubles did not exist.\u201d When McLean began transitioning from male to female as an adult, many childhood friends rejected her. But she found welcome on a local women\u2019s hockey team. \u201cMost of them knew that I was trans, but didn\u2019t care. They accepted me as one of their own. For whatever reason \u2014perhaps because our connection was not anchored in superficial ideals of masculinity \u2014 they loved me for me\u2026 I\u2019ve gone to teammates\u2019 weddings and baby showers and supported them through some of the hardest moments of their lives.\u201d McLean has watched with dismay as politicians in Florida and other states have stoked anxiety about gender transitions with laws \u201cbanning trans athletes from participating in sports teams consistent with their gender identity. These laws really only target young trans kids in school who are looking to express themselves, play sports with their friends or who like me, escape their anxieties through competition.\u201d Allison Hope wrote that \u201cwhile attacks on our community are sadly nothing new, this current environment, in which public officials use dangerous rhetoric while peddling bills that discriminate against us, feels ever more fraught. It doesn\u2019t help that some Republicans are increasingly perpetuating the harmful myth that liberals and members of the LGBTQ community are grooming children \u2013 a move that shatters any illusions that the US has become fully understanding and accepting of our LGBTQ lives and experiences.\u201d At the behest of Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida legislature last week voted to strip Disney of its ability to exercise governmental powers in the area surrounding its theme parks. The move came in retaliation for the company\u2019s opposition to the new law limiting what can be taught in schools about gender and sexual orientation. The move is \u201cmore than just a slimy and indefensible rearguard effort to punish a private company for violating GOP orthodoxy,\u201d Greg Sargent wrote in The Washington Post. It points \u201cto a potential future Republican Party that envisions an expanded use of state power to fight the culture wars in a much broader and more pernicious sense.\u201d DeSantis\u2019 move against Disney was a \u201cpolitical masterstroke,\u201d according to Henry Olsen, also writing for The Washington Post. It enlists support both from the GOP\u2019s base, which is animated by cultural issues and from libertarians who oppose giving Disney special privileges. If big business \u201cprioritizes cultural stances, it should expect to methodically be driven out of the GOP coalition,\u201d wrote Olsen. \u201cBut joining the Democrats means it will be locked in constant warfare with that party\u2019s growing progressive wing. Trying to play the two sides against one another will likely antagonize both parties\u2019 vocal activists and leave business with no friends to defend it when the chips are down. Thus, big business must increasingly decide what it cares more about: its culture or its profits.\u201d For more on the politics of state actions: James Moore: Abbott\u2019s border policies are nothing more than a stunt David Daley: Gerrymandering on steroids is the new normal Florida also made news last week for the state Education Department\u2019s rejection of dozens of math textbooks which it claimed touched on prohibited topics such as critical race theory. In an editorial, the Palm Beach Post said the state had failed to back up its case that the textbooks weren\u2019t appropriate: \u201cIn an increasingly complex and diverse world, Florida\u2019s schoolchildren deserve the best educational material possible, not one filtered through a particular political dogma. Unfortunately, in trying to \u2018own the libs,\u2019 state leaders are shortchanging students.\u201d But in the long run, the more significant action came in the state legislature, which passed \u201cDeSantis\u2019s proposed congressional map that would add four seats likely to go to Republicans, do away with districts now represented by two of the state\u2019s Black US House members and potentially prompt a federal court challenge to the Voting Rights Act,\u201d as Peniel E. Joseph noted. \u201cHow are we to claim to be the world\u2019s more important and enduring democracy around the world and yet fail to safeguard the sacred right to vote for our citizens at home? We can start by choosing country over party and passing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\u201d Democrats may not have the votes to pass the bill in Congress yet, Joseph noted, but they \u201cshould remind voters at every opportunity of what is at stake on the ballot during the upcoming midterms. Republicans who are good faith political actors (in contrast to bad faith political actors who celebrate the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday while refusing to support voting rights) should join together with Democrats to pursue a halt to voter suppression.\u201d May 9 is \u201cVictory Day\u201d in Russia, an occasion for military parades and the commemoration of Nazi Germany\u2019s surrender in 1945. As Frida Ghitis noted, \u201cUS intelligence assessments, Russian foreign policy analysts and common sense all indicate that (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin will use May 9 as a sort of self-imposed deadline in Ukraine. It\u2019s not a deadline to win the war \u2014 that will likely not happen by then \u2013 but to pretend Russia has won something. Something major. Something important.\u201d There\u2019s no end in sight to the horrific combat in the Donbas region, the section of eastern Ukraine where Russia has been waging war for the last eight years \u2014 and has seen increased fighting since Putin\u2019s troops abandoned their attempt to encircle Kyiv. \u201cThat\u2019s where Putin will seek a face-saving success, a concrete victory he can take to the Russian people to tell them he is still the larger-than-life leader whose \u2018special military operation,\u2019 with all the hardship it is causing for Russians \u2014 let alone the calamity it is inflicting on Ukraine \u2014 has been worth the price tag. Unfortunately, his desperation for a win likely means that the next three weeks are sure to bring even worse death and destruction to Ukraine.\u201d For more: Jeffrey Sachs: A negotiated peace is the only way to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine Aaron David Miller: Why the world fails on the \u2018Never again\u2019 pledge Patrick Lyoya was shot dead by a Grand Rapids, Michigan, police officer during a traffic stop earlier this month. The 26-year-old was pulled over for improper registration, authorities said, and a physical encounter broke out between the two. \u201cAs much as many Americans grieve for the snuffing out of Lyoya\u2019s life,\u201d Issac Bailey wrote, \u201call of this is so ordinary, so standard, that most of us never consider how absurd a practice it is for traffic violations to be the purview of police with guns. We continue that practice even though it\u2019s a logical conclusion that unarmed traffic personnel and technology can handle many such things quite well without increasing the chances for bloodshed and death.\u201d Bailey noted that a New York Times investigation \u201cfound that over the past five years, police officers have killed at least 400 drivers or passengers who were wielding neither a gun nor knife and weren\u2019t suspected of having committed a violent crime. According to the Times, they had been pulled over for things such as swerving across double yellow lines.\u201d \u201cI drive on toll roads in North Carolina. They send me a bill in the mail 30 days later. No one armed with a Glock and Taser and baton has to be involved to ensure I\u2019d pay what I owe. From red light cameras to robots to unarmed human traffic enforcement, we have a variety of mechanisms that could perhaps have been used by (or in place of) that unnamed officer in Grand Rapids.\u201d On the surface, Trump lords over the Republican Party, granting audiences and dispensing much-coveted endorsements from his Mar-a-Lago base. But the full picture is much more complicated \u2014 and this week the depth of the private discontent among GOP leaders became clearer. In the days following the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol, according to a book by New York Times reporters Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately expressed outrage at Trump\u2019s role in fueling the election lie that set the stage for the violence that followed. As Julian Zelizer noted, McConnell said, \u201cIf this isn\u2019t impeachable, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d according to the Times. \u201cBoth McCarthy and McConnell, of course, voted to acquit Trump of inciting an insurrection when the former President was impeached for the second time,\u201d Zelizer observed. \u201cThis refusal to hold Trump accountable, and the pressure both McCarthy and McConnell felt to take this stance, reveals just how far the Republican Party has shifted in recent decades.\u201d  \u201cEven something as dramatic as a full-scale attack on a presidential election, coupled with a violent attack on Congress, is not enough to break the rank partisanship we\u2019ve seen from Republicans. It\u2019s clear from their actions that the political strength of the party supersedes all else, even the health of our democratic institutions.\u201d Michael D\u2019Antonio noted that Trump\u2019s rally crowds are growing sparser and more Republicans are speaking out. \u201cFrank Luntz, a longtime GOP pollster, said in a recent interview that many Republicans are laughing at\u2026 Trump in private. \u2018They won\u2019t say it, but behind his back, they think he\u2019s a child. \u2026Trump isn\u2019t the same man he was a year ago. Even many Republicans are tired of going back and rehashing the 2020 election,\u2019 Luntz told the Daily Beast.\u201d At the same time, his potential rival in the 2024 race, President Joe Biden, has endured several months of dismal approval ratings that are about as low the ones Trump logged during his presidency. Biden\u2019s central problem: Inflation continues at levels that are the highest in decades. And Jason Furman, an economist who chaired President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, wrote for Project Syndicate that strong consumer demand is driving prices up, and \u201cwe should expect high inflation to stay with us for some time.\u201d For more: SE Cupp video: This GOPer could be a spoiler in a Republican presidential primary A new Showtime series tells the stories of three first ladies \u2014 Eleanor Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama \u2014 through the performances of actors Gillian Anderson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Viola Davis. \u201cAll three chafe at the central contradiction of the role, one that ushers them to the center of national power not through their achievements but through their husbands\u2019, offering new avenues of influence while strictly policing how they use that influence,\u201d wrote Nicole Hemmer. In \u201cThe First Lady,\u201d Roosevelt rejects the notion that the role is actually a job, even though she would be the first to leverage the role for real political influence. The question remains, though, whether it should be a job. While first ladies have at times used the office to do meaningful work, the idea that presidential spouses are required to spend most of their time as glorified hosts seems increasingly out of touch.\u201d \u201cThe women in \u2018The First Lady\u2019 make the most of their circumstances, but the show is a reminder that they may have been better served by not being forced into those circumstances in the first place.\u201d When he wasn\u2019t hunting wild game, Theodore Roosevelt was a pioneering conservationist. As President, \u201cRoosevelt established 150 national forests and five national parks \u2014 and protected over 230 million acres of public land,\u201d his great-great grandson John Palfrey wrote. \u201cBut Roosevelt, and many others in the conservation movement, did not do enough to protect the Earth with equity in mind. These White leaders failed to recognize the extraordinary role that Indigenous people played in protecting and nurturing our planet.\u201d Palfrey, president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, added that, \u201cClimate justice means recognizing and addressing the fact that marginalized communities will feel \u2014 and have already felt \u2014 the worst impacts of climate change. We must make sure that those who face these effects are in positions of power, where they are able to make decisions for their own communities and to contribute to research and creative solutions.\u201d For more: Kathleen Rogers: If we want to solve climate change, businesses need to invest in our planet Jeff Yang: This movie\u2019s Asian American metaphor is a message to the not-so United States Dean Obeidallah: On Tax Day, the rich\u2019s failure to pay fair share of taxes stinks worse than Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter bid Rim-Sarah Alouane: In France, the far-right has already won Zoe Jacoby and Reshma Ramachandran: What we owe new mothers Wazhma Frogh: Locked out of classrooms, Afghan girls are taking drastic measures Scott Galloway: The most dangerous person in the world is a young man who\u2019s broke and alone Sally Hayden: UK deal with Rwanda dashes migrants\u2019 hopes AND\u2026 William Shakespeare died 406 years ago, but his life and work remain an inexhaustible source for everything cultural we consume today, from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to this weekend\u2019s new movie, \u201cThe Northman.\u201d As Jeffrey R.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Russia and Japan are officially at war. Let that sink in: 76 years after the combat of World War II ended, talks to finally declare peace between Russia and Japan collapsed late last month. The two nations never reached a treaty because Russia refused to give up four islands the Soviet Union seized off the north coast of Japan in 1945. The Washington Post reported Thursday that thousands of Japanese people who fled the islands after that long-ago invasion are now seeing their dream of returning home dashed by the new tension over the war in Ukraine. Russia said it would withdraw from peace talks over the disputed territory in response to sanctions imposed by Japan after the invasion of Ukraine. It\u2019s a classic example of the \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d that have persisted in regions around the world long after the fighting stops. Last week, missile attacks continued to pound Ukraine\u2019s cities, despite a claim by the Russians that they were refocusing their strategy on warfare in the eastern part of the country. No one knows how the war will unfold and either side could win, but the chances may be good that it too will eventually become a frozen conflict. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief last week suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to cleave western Ukraine from the Russian-separatist portions of the east and create a divide much like the one between North and South Korea. That\u2019s another frozen conflict, even though hostilities in the Korean War ended on July 27, 1953. \u201cFor a brief moment this week, it seemed vaguely possible that Russia might ease its brutal onslaught in parts of Ukraine,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cAfter Russian envoys spoke to a Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul, Turkey, on Tuesday, the Russian deputy defense minister announced that Moscow would draw back its forces and \u2018drastically reduce military activity\u2019 around the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv to boost \u2018mutual trust.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut those who have been paying close attention to Russia under its leader Vladimir Putin knew better than to take their word for it.\u201d Can Putin\u2019s word be trusted, Ghitis asked. \u201cHow do you negotiate with an interlocutor who lies routinely, repeatedly and without compunction? How do you negotiate with a regime that has a decades-long track record of breaking its international commitments?\u201d In the Financial Times, Edward Luce argued, \u201cAt some point, the west will have to talk to the enemy it has rather than the one it would like. That will mean doing some kind of a deal with Putin. The alternative \u2013 aiming for Russia\u2019s unconditional surrender and the ejection of Putin \u2013 is a bet western leaders cannot afford to indulge.\u201d Luce noted that \u201cFew believe Putin is ever likely to drop his ultimate ambition of swallowing Ukraine. Any deal, let alone a ceasefire, should thus be treated as a tactical pause.\u201d His bleak outlook: \u201cUkraine could be forced to suffer months or even years of bloody stalemate.\u201d Lawrence Freedman, also writing in the FT, argued that \u201cfor now neither side has an incentive to commit to a long-term settlement. They are waiting for military breakthroughs and a clearer view on the likely course of the war. Should the prospect be one of a long stalemate, then both might feel obliged to compromise.\u201d In a conversation with Peter Bergen, retired US Major General Mike Repass said the Russian invasion \u201cculminated\u201d nearly a week ago, meaning that Putin\u2019s forces \u201cno longer have sufficient combat power to continue to advance in the offense.\u201d But he added that the extent of losses on the Ukrainian side is not clear, which makes predicting the future course of the war extremely difficult. President Joe Biden\u2019s pronouncement on Putin could not have been clearer: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201d Yet as soon as he said it, the cleanup by US officials began \u2013 and the President later clarified that he was talking only about his moral outrage over the invasion, not about seeking regime change in the Kremlin. Dean Obeidallah wrote that Biden had nothing to apologize for. \u201cThe world has seen the horrors Putin has rained down upon the people of Ukraine simply because they won\u2019t bend a knee to this brutal dictator and agree to give up their democracy and self-determination,\u201d Obeidallah observed. But if Americans think that appeals to morality would prompt the strongmen (siloviki) around Putin to oust him or force a change in policy, they\u2019re mistaken, wrote former CIA clandestine service official Douglas London. \u201cIn the multi-level chess game of internal Russian power dynamics,\u201d London wrote, \u201cthe last thing those within the Kremlin who might consider moving against Putin need \u2013 whether to alter his direction on the war or remove him outright \u2013 is public encouragement from an American president \u2026 Russians in positions of power today do not necessarily subscribe to Jeffersonian democratic ideals or see America as the world\u2019s shining beacon of light. They are focused on the attainment and preservation of power and privilege.\u201d For more: Margo Gontar: Sasha\u2019s story brought the Ukraine war home to me in a shattering way Galip Dalay: Why Turkey is in a unique position to mediate Many Washington Republicans have been wary of criticizing Madison Cawthorn, the 26-year-old representative from North Carolina who has triggered one controversy after another in his short congressional career. As SE Cupp noted, Cawthorn has \u201cmade quite the name for himself in the 14 months he\u2019s been in Congress.\u201d \u201cThere was that time he tried to board a plane with a gun in his carry-on, he claimed by mistake.\u201d \u201cAnd the time he posted \u2013 and deleted \u2013 pictures from his vacation at Hitler\u2019s summer retreat. He called Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who does not drink, an alcoholic. He spoke at the rally that preceded the Capitol insurrection, and later tried to blame the violence there on Democratic agitators. He\u2019s falsely claimed elections are rigged and promised \u2018bloodshed\u2019 if they continue to be.\u201d But what finally prompted widespread condemnation? \u201cHe went on a podcast last week and suggested that Washington was full of open drug use and orgies,\u201d Cupp said. \u201cIt really says something that the bridge too far wasn\u2019t his role in the insurrection, spreading lies about elections, slandering his colleagues, racist attacks against his opponents, or any of the other vile parts of his resume. It was what he said about THEM.\u201d It happened so suddenly that viewers assumed it was all part of the pre-planned Oscars show when Will Smith got up from his seat and slapped Chris Rock last Sunday. Peniel E. Joseph thought it was a \u201ckind of \u2018SNL\u2019-inspired skit designed to juice up a show whose lag in cultural relevancy has been much discussed.\u201d \u201cThe slap heard round the world turned out not to be a skit, but an unplanned eruption whose cultural significance is now being refracted through the distorted lens of our disunited nation.\u201d \u201cSmith ostensibly struck the comedian in defense of his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, after Rock joked about her shaved head (a result of alopecia, a disease that Pinkett Smith has openly discussed),\u201d wrote Joseph. \u201cAs a Black man who believes that both racism and patriarchy have had negative effects on the Black community, I don\u2019t believe in resorting to violence in the face of insults. However, none of us are the worst thing we have ever done. Smith\u2019s actions do not negate all the good he has contributed as an actor, artist and humanitarian.\u201d \u201cNor does the wrongness of Smith\u2019s behavior make Rock\u2019s joke the right thing to have said at the Oscars.\u201d Holly Thomas observed that \u201cSmith\u2019s reaction, like his words during his acceptance speech, were more about himself than his wife \u2013 and that\u2019s what rankles most. Men shouldn\u2019t use women\u2019s interests as a rationalization for hitting people \u2013 and sending the message that this is what women want of men is not only unhelpful, but potentially dangerous.\u201d \u201cAs a superstar with every resource and PR tool under the sun at his disposal, Will Smith could have chosen from countless ways to respond to Rock\u2019s joke \u2026 \u201cWhatever he decided to do, he should have waited to see whether it was what his wife, the subject of the joke, actually wanted, before centering himself and escalating a conflict she may not have been happy to amplify.\u201d Smith created \u201ca \u2018hey-look-at-me\u2019 moment destined to be all anyone would talk about or remember,\u201d wrote Bill Carter in CNN Business Perspectives. \u201cThen he turned his acceptance speech into more \u2018look-at-me\u2019 theatrics, seeking to justify an ugly act of violence as some form of noble family values, even saying, \u2018Love will make you do crazy things.\u2019\u201d The move detracted from other winners, including Questlove, who took home the Oscar for best documentary shortly after the incident, Carter observed. \u201cHow much did Smith\u2019s actions unjustly overshadow the powerfully moving words from winners like Ariana DeBose (Best Supporting Actress), Jane Campion (Best Director), Sian Heder (Best Adapted Screenplay) and Troy Kotsur (Best Actor in a Supporting Role), all of whom may never experience a night like that again in their lives? What right did Smith have to seize attention away from them?\u201d The midterm election that will determine which party controls the House and Senate is more than seven months away, and anything can happen. Despite the fast-growing economy, the Democrats\u2019 hold on Congress seems at genuine risk. Biden\u2019s approval rating notched down to 39% in the CNN poll of polls last week. Fairly or not, voters are watching the price signs at gas stations and blaming Biden for surging inflation. And even among Democrats\u2019 own ranks, there\u2019s discontent. Jill Filipovic faulted the President for increasing spending on defense and policing while setting a modest agenda for  social programs in his proposed budget. \u201cDespite progressive hopes that the President might be a secret Franklin Delano Roosevelt capable of ushering in an ambitious domestic agenda, Biden is exactly the timid moderate he always appeared to be.\u201d \u201cHe seems to be hoping that an agenda of the same old tacking-right policies will benefit vulnerable Democrats in the midterms. Instead, he may simply be depressing Democratic enthusiasm and helping to consign the party to a red wave \u2026 he seems more concerned with convincing the public that he\u2019s a pro-police, pro-military tough guy and less interested in delivering the things that would materially improve the lives of average folks.\u201d On Friday, the White House announced it would end a Trump-administration policy of turning back migrants at the southern border due to the Covid-19 pandemic. So far, \u201c1.7 million migrants have been sent back across the southern US border to Mexico, or repatriated to their country of origin,\u201d wrote Raul A. Reyes.  \u201cFrom the start, Trump\u2019s invocation of Title 42 was driven by politics, not by legitimate health concerns. In fact, when the Trump administration sought to implement the law, the CDC doctor who oversaw the regulation refused to comply.\u201d The policy reversal could produce a large flow of migrants crossing the border later this spring, Reyes noted. GOP critics will cite the change to accuse Democrats of favoring \u201copen borders\u201d and \u201cwill paint doomsday scenarios of migrants crossing the border. Yet GOP lawmakers have never offered any constructive immigration or asylum solutions of their own \u2026\u201d \u201cWhat this country is really confronting is decades of neglect and mishandling of US immigration policy by successive presidential administrations.\u201d For more on politics: Julian Zelizer: Rick Scott\u2019s \u2018Plan to Rescue America\u2019 will do anything but that John Eastman, a lawyer who attempted to fashion an argument for overturning Joe Biden\u2019s election win in 2020, went to court to try to block the release of some documents to the January 6 select committee. What he didn\u2019t count on getting was one of the most powerful statements by a federal judge against former President Donald Trump\u2019s election lie. US District Court Judge David Carter wrote, \u201cIf Dr. Eastman and President Trump\u2019s plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the court fears January 6 will repeat itself.\u201d Carter\u2019s ruling \u201csets out a road map for finally imposing consequences for the big lie,\u201d wrote Norman Eisen and Fred Wertheimer. \u201cIt does so by tackling the thorniest legal issues regarding Trump, his enablers and the events in and around January 6, 2021 \u2013 and showing how they can be addressed by prosecutors.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump once again asked Putin for help. In an interview, Michael D\u2019Antonio noted, \u201cThe former President pushed an unproven claim about alleged business dealings in Russia by Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Trump also urged Putin to release any information he might have on the younger Biden\u2019s business transactions \u2013 even though it\u2019s far from clear that the Kremlin has access to any.\u201d \u201cSeeking Russian help to attack a political foe is a familiar maneuver by Trump. He tried and failed to manufacture a scandal involving Biden\u2019s son in 2019. The difference this time, though, is that Putin now is a reviled figure around the world due to his scorched-earth invasion of Ukraine. Trump could not have chosen a worse moment to remind us that, for years, he cozied up to the Kremlin leader while alienating America\u2019s allies and intelligence services.\u201d CNN reported last week that the investigation of Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities has \u201cgained steam.\u201d Dean Obeidallah wrote that \u201cIf there\u2019s credible evidence that Hunter Biden \u2013 or anyone for that matter, Democrat or Republican \u2013 may have committed a federal crime, there should be a DOJ investigation.\u201d \u201cYet the sense many have is that this DOJ has no problem investigating people named Biden and Clinton but we have seen no signs of investigating Trump despite Garland\u2019s promise in January that \u2018The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law.\u2019 And the longer that apparent double standard continues, the more Americans will question if in fact \u2018partisan considerations\u2019 are driving the DOJ\u2019s decisions when it comes to Trump.\u201d Kirsten Powers: The Pope puts a crack in the Catholic Church\u2019s \u2018stained glass ceiling\u2019 Allison Hope: Tremendous news for women\u2019s sports Dorottya R\u00e9dai: How children became a tool in Orban\u2019s anti-LGBTQ propaganda Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Orban\u2019s juggling act with Putin and Europe faces a key test Kehinde Andrews: Will and Kate\u2019s colonial nostalgia tour is about more than disastrous photo-ops Rosa Baier and Vanessa Lamers: We want our kids vaccinated \u2013 but we can\u2019t rush the process Peggy Drexler: Putting your Covid diagnosis on blast is no longer a thing Ben Cardin and Lisa Murkowski: The US Constitution does not guarantee women equality. We intend to change that Edward J. McCaffery: Governors have so much extra money, they\u2019re giving it away AND \u2026 In classical music, a coda is the concluding section of a piece or movement. But CODA has another meaning, dramatically portrayed in the film that won Best Picture at the Oscars. As CNN\u2019s Lilit Marcus wrote, \u201cYes, my parents are Deaf. Yes, I am hearing. CODA stands for Child of Deaf Adults. No, I didn\u2019t invent it.\u201d As a child, Marcus joked that she wanted to print a stack of note cards with those four lines and hand them out to \u201ceveryone who interrogated me about my family and my background.\u201d \u201cCODA,\u201d the movie, \u201cdidn\u2019t change my life. It showed my life.\u201d \u201cI was the older of two hearing children raised by a Deaf father and a hard-of-hearing mother in the 1980s and 1990s. When I was young, a teacher told me I \u2018didn\u2019t count\u2019 as bilingual because ASL \u2018isn\u2019t a real language,\u2019 TV captions were optional to provide and often inaccurate, and I never invited people over for dinner because I wanted to eat my food while it was hot instead of spending the whole night translating.\u201d In Marcus\u2019 eyes, the film is a breakthrough. \u201cTo see a multitude of Deaf stories at one time in \u2018CODA\u2019 is a reminder that plurality is important. What if Hollywood took a break from rebooting Spider-Man yet again and devoted the budget to films that depict disabled stories and identities?\u201d In the film\u2019s wake, \u201ca whole new crop of children will never have to explain what \u2018CODA\u2019 means. They will never need note cards. And maybe, just maybe, they will never have to apologize for who they are.\u201d",

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. For a brief moment this week, it seemed vaguely possible that Russia might ease its brutal onslaught in parts of Ukraine. After Russian envoys spoke to a Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul, Turkey, on Tuesday, the Russian deputy defense minister announced that Moscow would draw back its forces and \u201cdrastically reduce military activity\u201d around the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv to boost \u201cmutual trust.\u201d But those who have been paying close attention to Russia under its leader Vladimir Putin knew better than to take their word for it. Even as oil prices dropped and stock markets climbed in response to signs of a potential breakthrough, President Joe Biden sounded skeptical, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll see if they follow through what they\u2019re suggesting.\u201d Within hours, Russian shells and missiles started slamming buildings in Chernihiv and in the outskirts of Kyiv. Chernihiv Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko, describing a \u201ccolossal attack\u201d on the city, said, \u201cThis is yet another confirmation that Russia always lies.\u201d Suddenly, the sunny Russian proclamations of \u201csignificant progress\u201d by one top official in Istanbul were replaced with dark statements from another in Moscow. That truth is the first casualty of war has become a clich\u00e9. But it didn\u2019t take a war for Putin\u2019s Russia to launch a stream of falsehoods and disinformation. The deceptions started decades ago and they never stopped. The war allowed the world to see it deployed in real time. How do you negotiate with an interlocutor who lies routinely, repeatedly and without compunction? How do you negotiate with a regime that has a decades-long track record of breaking its international commitments? Among the many broken promises is the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, when Russia, in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s agreement to hand over the nuclear weapons it held from the Soviet era, vowed to respect Ukraine\u2019s borders, sovereignty and independence. And in Russia\u2019s 1997 \u201cFounding Act\u201d agreement with NATO, it promised not only to commit to democracy and the rule of law, but to refrain \u201cfrom the threat or use of force\u2026against any other state, its sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence.\u201d Opinion: Even Russia's ruthless war in Ukraine can't get Trump to give up his Putin fixation Ukrainians say the current negotiations are nothing but a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to allow battered Russian forces to regroup. Many observers agree. Now, US intelligence claims Putin has been misled by his generals about the extent of Russia\u2019s losses. If Putin himself is now the victim of disinformation from members of his inner circle at this crucial moment, it would be a sublime case of poetic justice: The world\u2019s leading practitioner of tactical gaslighting, hoisted on his own petard! Putin built an empire of lies from the early days of his rise to power. Putin used the still-murky origins of the Moscow apartment bombings in 1999 as a pretext to pulverize Chechnya and paint himself as the muscular defender of the Russian people, just in time to win his first presidential election. Over the next two decades, Putin would leave a visible trail of lies and deception: the mysterious deaths of his most prominent rivals; the poisonings of critics; the fabricated charges against his now-imprisoned challengers; the interference in elections in the US and other democracies. And, as happens with highly personalized autocracies, his tactics have been replicated by those surrounding him and carrying out his orders. Even more troubling, Putin\u2019s successful monopolization of power in Russia turned him into an icon of would-be strongmen around the world, as populists with autocratic tendencies replicate his disinformation campaigns to seek and retain power. It\u2019s no coincidence that former US President Donald Trump, who has lavished Putin with praise and just this week asked for his help yet again, spent four years in office lying to the public, and is still lying about losing the 2020 election almost 18 months after the results were settled. In Russia, the war against Ukraine \u2013 which Russian law prohibits journalists from calling a \u201cwar\u201d \u2013 was launched from a runway of lies: Putin and his aides incessantly denied Russia would invade, while absurdly claiming that Ukraine is run by Nazis who threaten Russia. Since the war started, the lying has continued unabated, with ever more preposterous accusations, while the gaslighting has become increasingly transparent. Why Russia's elite are the key to Putin's downfall The operating principle, \u201cbelieve what I say, not what you see,\u201d was in full force when Putin\u2019s spokesman Dimitry Peskov told CNN that Russia has only attacked military targets, even though the entire world has seen the bombed apartments and civilian targets, which include schools and hospitals which endanger children. Russian citizens are being told that Ukraine is developing biological weapons, even though the US and its allies have warned that Russia could be using this as an excuse to launch its own biological or chemical attacks. Russia has also suggested Ukraine wants nuclear weapons, even though the Kremlin itself has suggested it might resort to using them. A friend in Russia just told me she doesn\u2019t believe anything anyone says, on either side. That\u2019s what happens when you swim in an ocean of lies. How, then, do you negotiate with a government that cannot be believed; one that cannot be trusted to keep its word, to abide by its commitments? No matter how this war ends and how the lines might be drawn, Russia will still stand on the other side of the border. That\u2019s Ukraine\u2019s reality. One day, Putin will no longer hold power. But for now, the fact is that this war will not be settled at the negotiating table, even if both sides eventually come to an agreement.  The outline of that final agreement will be to a large extent the product of what happens on the battlefield. To succeed at the negotiating table, Ukraine, with the West\u2019s help, must prevail in its military campaign and gain enough leverage that the undeniable reality will overshadow Putin\u2019s fabrications. Putin will lie to his people and to the world about how the war unfolded. The Russian people may not learn the truth until he is gone, but for Ukrainians enduring Russia\u2019s assault, and for Russian soldiers and those dying to defend Putin\u2019s empire of lies, already the truth is all too clear.",

He is the founder of Big Bend Strategies and publishes regularly at Texas to the World. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN. The big lie is alive and well in Texas. Many of the Republican primary candidates running for statewide positions are repeating former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election. Perpetuating this lie might be key to maintaining electoral viability in the Texas GOP, especially since polling indicates that Republicans overwhelmingly think Biden is an illegitimate president. According to a recent online survey by The Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, 67% of the state\u2019s Republicans believe Trump won, along with 33% of independent voters. GOP primary candidates in Texas are also displaying an alarming fealty to Trump as they clamor for his approval and fight among each other to pander to his supporters. Few high-profile Texas politicians have publicly stepped back from the former president\u2019s claims or his ideologies. In the Republican race for state attorney general, the incumbent Ken Paxton is facing off against Land Commissioner George P. Bush, former Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Rep. Louie Gohmert. Paxton is currently the frontrunner, despite a securities fraud indictment dating back to 2015 that remains unresolved. He also faces allegations of bribery and corruption from his former staffers. (Paxton, who has sought to cast the accusations from his staffers as sour grapes, denies any wrongdoing.) Voters' power is being stripped away with the stroke of a pen In 2020, the embattled attorney general filed a failed lawsuit to challenge Biden\u2019s election victory \u2013 a move that probably helped Paxton endear himself to Trump, who endorsed him over Bush. In a sad display of desperation, Bush, the heir to the family\u2019s political dynasty, tried to cozy up to Trump to earn his favor \u2013 even though the former president had publicly insulted his parents. It didn\u2019t work. And now, without Trump\u2019s endorsement, Bush seems to be settling for the next best thing \u2013 engaging in an argument with Guzman over who most supports Trump\u2019s favorite project, the border wall. Endorse Trump\u2019s policies even though he won\u2019t endorse you? There\u2019s a tactic that shows the fight among candidates to out-Trump each other. The dispute between Bush and Guzman is a blatant attempt to pander to Trump\u2019s far right supporters \u2013 especially since the Texas attorney general has no authority to fund or build a wall, on the border or anywhere else in the state. Meanwhile, Paxton has launched attacks on Gohmert, who pushed Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 election was stolen in a lawsuit against former Vice President Mike Pence. Paxton\u2019s strategists likely view the US congressman, a latecomer to the race, as a threat who can draw away primary voters and force a runoff. The political posture of the Texas governor might be just as confounding in the runup to the primary elections. Gov. Greg Abbott has Trump\u2019s endorsement, but the imprimatur of his party\u2019s leader has not shielded him from angry Republicans in Texas. Abbott was loudly booed and called names at a recent Trump rally in East Texas last month. The obvious conclusion is that the man who led the fight for an extreme anti-abortion law and militarized the border is not conservative enough for many Trump supporters. His two most viable primary opponents, former State Sen. Don Huffines, and former GOP Texas chairman Allen West, are running to Abbott\u2019s right as some call the governor a RINO (Republican in Name Only). A huge opportunity for an embattled Biden The risk for Abbott is that the Trump backing might not protect him from a runoff. Primary turnout is historically small, and early voting this year is  \u201cabysmally low\u201d in some areas. This could leave Abbott vulnerable to opponents who are accusing him of not being bold enough on the border while being too tough on Covid (even though Abbott tried to ban mask mandates and threatened to fine local officials and businesses that tried to enforce them). Nonetheless, Abbott is likely to win the majority needed to avoid a runoff, but if he comes close to 50%, failed Trump mojo may take the blame as much as getting assailed from the right for not being sufficiently conservative. Trump has even gotten involved in the GOP primary for Texas agriculture commissioner. He endorsed the incumbent Sid Miller before his political consultant Todd Smith was indicted for selling hemp licenses at kickback prices to farmers. (Smith has denied wrongdoing, and Miller cut ties with him, although he said he did not think Smith had done anything wrong). Despite numerous controversies, the former champion rodeo cowboy \u2013 who Trump once considered for his Agriculture Secretary \u2013 still has a good chance to win his primary without a runoff, even though polls show a significant number of undecided voters. But doesn\u2019t the Texas GOP primary sound like a bad Netflix series? Still unknown is what impact Trump-inspired voter suppression laws will have on the GOP primary. The state\u2019s largest counties are rejecting mail-in ballots at record rates, with some turning away as many as 46%. Critics say the added ID requirement is designed to stifle turnout, which could harm both parties. The conservative-controlled Texas legislature says the changes are intended to protect election integrity, a problem the state simply does not have.  The energy Texas politicians are wasting on pleasing an extremist former president might be more wisely spent on confronting the state\u2019s many troubling issues.  A short list includes the closing of rural hospitals, dramatically increasing real estate costs and property taxes, the banning of books, billions of tax dollars spent on police and soldiers at the border and failing infrastructure. Texas Republicans need to spend more time on those challenges and not the manufactured crises of Donald Trump.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In the early morning hours of August 2, 1990, columns of Iraqi tanks crossed the border into Kuwait, taking over the smaller nation. The world\u2019s response to Saddam Hussein\u2019s surprise assault on a sovereign country was swift and ultimately devastating. A coalition led by the US, with the support of the United Nations Security Council, attacked Iraq and restored Kuwait\u2019s independence. But the consequences of the unprovoked war didn\u2019t end there: For three decades, Iraq was required to compensate the Kuwaiti victims of Saddam\u2019s invasion. Just this past Tuesday, the Security Council voted unanimously to confirm that Iraq had fulfilled its obligation after it paid out $52 billion. It\u2019s an accident of timing that within two days Russian President Vladimir Putin would announce that he had launched a war against neighboring Ukraine. He called it a \u201cspecial military operation,\u201d but it was in reality an unprovoked invasion. Democracies around the world condemned it. But this is not 1990, Ukraine is not Kuwait and most importantly, Putin is not Saddam. After all, the Russian president presides over a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons. He promised \u201csuch consequences that you have never experienced in your history\u201d to anyone who \u201ctries to interfere with us\u2026\u201d While NATO countries are strengthening defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank and the West is imposing severe sanctions, none are intervening directly in Ukraine\u2019s defense. So the key question is: What, if any, is the long-term price Putin will pay? One outcome thus far: nearly worldwide condemnation of Russia for its president\u2019s attack on Ukraine and a wave of sympathy for the people of Ukraine. \u201cThe threat from a nuclear-armed dictator defying the international community and sending a massive military machine to crush its neighbor in the 21st century cannot be overestimated,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cThe international community, led by the US, cannot be intimidated by a Russian tyrant who throws his critics in prison and invades his neighbors.\u201d Russian officials had repeatedly denied US assertions that it was preparing to invade Ukraine. But \u201cin the end, Putin did exactly what President Biden told the world he would do: He launched an invasion of Ukraine on a runway of lies,\u201d Ghitis noted. \u201cThe challenge for the West could not be clearer,\u201d wrote Russia scholar Daniel Treisman. \u201cIf Putin succeeds in undermining Ukraine, he is unlikely to stop there. His distrust of the West and expansive view of Russia\u2019s destiny are by now deeply entrenched. Our policy must raise the cost of eroding the international order.\u201d At a 2015 reception, Treisman \u201casked Putin about his planning for the occupation of Crimea. \u2018I was even surprised at how well it went!\u2019 he told me with a smile. The West must make sure he does not find it so easy this time.\u201d A UN Security Council resolution condemning the invasion was vetoed by Russia Friday, but international law expert Mary Ellen O\u2019Connell argued that \u201cthe UN General Assembly \u2013 the body that includes all 193 member states \u2013 could activate the Uniting for Peace Resolution and meet in an Emergency Special Session to coordinate worldwide sanctions and other measures to enforce the Charter\u2026The General Assembly can demonstrate to Russia in the current crisis how isolated it is and launch a global campaign of sanctions.\u201d On Saturday, the US proposed such an emergency session of the General Assembly. Do sanctions exact enough pain to stop an aggressor like Putin? Peter Bergen is skeptical: \u201cAuthoritarian regimes generally shake off even draconian sanctions at the expense of their own people. Look at Kim Jung Un\u2019s North Korea today or Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq during the 1990s; punishing US sanctions helped to immiserate the North Korean and Iraqi populations with scant consequences for their regimes.\u201d Such action wouldn\u2019t likely shake Putin\u2019s determination to dominate Ukraine, an impulse he made clear in his remarks Monday. \u201cOn the cusp of declaring portions of Ukraine as stand-alone \u2018people\u2019s republics,\u2019 he embarked on a rambling, distorted and utterly chilling hour-long rewrite of Russian and Soviet history in a televised speech to his nation,\u201d wrote David Andelman, who called it a \u201cfrightening insight\u201d into Putin\u2019s thinking that should alarm the Baltic states and other former republics of the Soviet Union. \u201cFor the strongman, a government\u2019s only meaningful source of legitimacy is strength,\u201d wrote Franklin Foer in the Atlantic. \u201cBorders are simply an expression of a nation\u2019s might. A people\u2019s sense of nationhood and its claims to its own history are meaningless if it is too weak to defend itself\u2026  \u201cIf Putin is bent on provoking NATO into a wider war, will Biden join it? These are dreadful questions, where high ideals crash against terrifying realities, and they will define the Biden presidency.\u201d Looking at the potential downside for Biden, Julian Zelizer pointed to the damage Jimmy Carter\u2019s presidency suffered as a result of his failure to persuade the Soviet Union to end its invasion of Afghanistan. \u201cIf this Russian assault on Ukraine continues for months and the humanitarian crisis turns out to be as bad as some expect, Biden\u2019s inability to take stronger action could become a major liability going into the midterms and the 2024 election,\u201d Zelizer wrote. \u201cIt will only be a matter of time before Republicans start reminding the public that a Democrat was in the White House both times Russia invaded Ukraine in the past decade.\u201d For more: Carrie Cordero: Was the US gamble on releasing Ukraine intelligence worth it? Paul Begala: A huge opportunity for an embattled Biden In Kyiv, Olesia Markovic\u2019s husband woke her up on Thursday with news that Russia was firing shells at Ukrainian targets. \u201cKyiv is facing a new reality,\u201d Markovic wrote. \u201cLots of people left in the morning, causing traffic jams on exit roads from the city to the south and west. We \u2013 my husband and eight-year-old son \u2013 decided to stay. Watching the live feed of traffic on TV we figured that it would be safer to stay home. Especially given that all infrastructure in Kyiv \u2013 electricity, internet, mobile phone connection, subway \u2013 still worked just fine\u2026\u201d \u201cWe have packed the necessities \u2013 folder with documents, laptops and carriers for our three pet cats in case we hear the shelling siren and have to go to the bomb shelter.\u201d Her son got a day off from school \u201cand doesn\u2019t seem concerned \u2013 after all, random school closures became the norm during lockdown. He took a choco-spread sandwich and went to the living room to watch Ironman (his favorite superhero) while we remained glued to our phones and updates of war.\u201d Friends have offered her sanctuary in the US and many other countries, but \u201cwhat is much more important now is to build a safety net for Ukraine. That means calling on the international community for help \u2013 diplomatic solutions, sanctions, pressure on Russia \u2013 anything that would make a dictator stop in his tracks.\u201d \u201cIn the meantime, Ukraine will stand strong. It\u2019s not the first time in our history that we resisted a threatening empire.\u201d In the western Ukraine city of Lviv, Michael Bociurkiw wrote Thursday, \u201cThe streets were empty and quiet but as the first rays of daylight emerged, anxiety and fear had begun to take hold: air raid sirens blared across the fortresses, churches and quaint cobblestone streets of Ukraine\u2019s cultural capital. A male voice instructed people to shelter in place and turn off their gas connections. People started to form long lines at bank cash machines and head to the markets while they were still open.\u201d \u201cWhile the full-scale invasion may have shocked some Western leaders,\u201d Bociurkiw noted, \u201cthe least surprised were the Ukrainians themselves, expressing an \u2018I told you so\u2019 attitude. Ukrainians always knew the sanctions threatened by the West were going to be too weak, and not go far enough in deterring this awful reality.\u201d In Russia, police locked up more than 2,000 demonstrators protesting Putin\u2019s war. \u201cThis is not a popular war among the Russian public,\u201d wrote Mathew Schmidt. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Westerners to understand that ethnic Ukrainians are a large minority in Russia. Millions of Putin\u2019s citizens have friends or relatives staring up the barrels of Russian guns.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a comedian-turned-politician whose popularity had declined sharply before this crisis. But, as Jay Parini wrote, \u201cThe past week has transmogrified Zelensky from a rapidly dwindling presidential figure into a national hero on a massive scale. He has shown himself to be a man who has dug into himself and found an inspiring store of courage. When the United States offered to evacuate him from Ukraine, he stood his ground, saying, \u2018The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe has posted several videos online, and they\u2019ve inspired a fierce defiance among the Ukrainian people. In one video titled \u2018We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are protecting Ukraine,\u2019 Zelensky can be seen surrounded by his top advisers. \u2018We are all here. Our army are here. Citizens and society are here,\u2019 he says. \u2018We are defending our independence, our state, and it will remain so.\u2019\u201d \u201cZelensky, a fluent Russian speaker, has also appealed to Russians in another video, urging them to \u2018just stop those who lie, lie to you, lie to us, lie to everyone, to the whole world. We need to end this war. We can live in peace, in a global peace.\u2019\u201d \u201cHis gifts for communication and his remarkable grasp of social media make him a formidable opponent for Putin,\u201d Parini noted, \u201ceven though the army he commands, in sheer numbers and resources, pales beside Russia\u2019s.\u201d Addressing Putin, Christian Caryl wrote in the Washington Post that \u201cover the past few years, Ukrainians (and the rest of the world) have seen more and more clearly the crass divide between your protestations of pan-Slavic brotherhood and the cynicism and corruption of your regime. Your speeches in recent days, in which you depicted Ukrainians as citizens of a half-imaginary country whose fate should be determined by the Kremlin, will only deepen the rupture between Russians and Ukrainians\u2026You can try to seize power through force and fear and lies \u2014 but you have already lost the war of ideas\u2026even if you try to terrorize Ukrainians into accepting a pro-Russian leader as your proxy, that effort will not endure, either. Ukrainians have been through that before.\u201d For more: Paul Hockenos: Good riddance Nord Stream 2. Now Europe has a golden opportunity. Biden announced his choice for a US Supreme Court seat Friday, introducing Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson at a White House ceremony. In concluding her remarks, Jackson pointed out that she shares a birthday with the late Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to serve as a federal judge. If confirmed by the Senate, Jackson will blaze a new path herself by becoming the first Black woman on the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cHer historic nomination promises an end to the erasure of Black women from our most sacred legal institutions,\u201d wrote Fatima Goss Graves. \u201cShe brings extensive litigation experience at every level of the federal court system, including distinguished service as a federal public defender.\u201d \u201cYou will not find a more qualified nominee,\u201d wrote Elie Honig. \u201cShe graduated from Harvard, both undergrad and law school. She clerked for a federal district court judge and then, in a nice bit of symmetry, nabbed a mega-prestigious clerkship with Justice Stephen Breyer, who she now stands to replace.\u201d Jackson \u201cwon\u2019t change the current ideological balance of the court by replacing Breyer,\u201d legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky noted. \u201cBut if Jackson is still a justice in 2040 and 2050, she may be a stabilizing force on a very different court.\u201d To Laura Coates, it\u2019s a plus that Jackson worked as a public defender. \u201cThe public may mistakenly view those who represent the accused as soft on crime. Indeed, if past is prologue, I expect such an absurd talking point to emerge during Jackson\u2019s confirmation hearings. But public defenders are not soft on crime \u2013 they are hard on injustice, which is precisely where we as a society must be. And precisely where a Supreme Court justice ought to be.\u201d Senators should ask Jackson for \u201cher view of the court\u2019s role in government and its responsibility to faithfully interpret the laws as written,\u201d wrote Adam White. \u201cIn an era when the Supreme Court is enduring partisan attacks on its legitimacy, and facing dangerous threats to pack the court for partisan purposes, it is crucial for senators \u2013 and all Americans \u2013 to know that the next justice is committed to preserving the rule of law and the court\u2019s indispensable constitutional role.\u201d Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor, observed that \u201cBiden is right to prioritize elevating judges who bring different backgrounds and experiences to the courts, especially to the Supreme Court, where not a single justice has Jackson\u2019s experience defending criminal cases. The Supreme Court needs more diversity, of all kinds; hopefully Jackson will be the first step in making that become a reality.\u201d For more on the Supreme Court: Jill Filipovic: Enough shocking stories about Ginni Thomas. It\u2019s time for some action Just how profoundly former President Donald Trump altered the politics of the right in America could be glimpsed last week by the way some conservatives praised Putin and made excuses for his hostility toward Ukraine. Not least was Trump himself, who referred to the Russian leader\u2019s takeover of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine as \u201cgenius\u201d and called Putin \u201cvery savvy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if the former President could have said anything more disturbing as Russia bullies a much smaller country,\u201d wrote Michael D\u2019Antonio. \u201cBut it\u2019s certain that as he sided with America\u2019s opponent, he was being true to himself.\u201d SE Cupp said \u201cfar-right voices in the Republican Party and in right-wing media seem hell-bent on helping the dictator with some free earned media and a ton of sycophantic praise\u2026 it seems to escape them that they are being used, they are doing Putin\u2019s dirty work, they are just pawns, and they\u2019re performing even better than expected.\u201d CNN legal analyst Areva Martin wrote that it wasn\u2019t a surprise that jurors quickly found the three men who shot and killed Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia guilty of federal hate crimes. \u201cThe prosecution called 21 witnesses, with many testifying about horrific and offensive racist slurs and rants by the defendants \u2013 hatred aimed specifically at Black people,\u201d Martin noted. \u201cThe language that witnesses attributed to all three men was so disturbing as to cause a juror to ask about counseling and to send one witness off the stand in tears.\u201d \u201cThe case speaks to bigger issues about an entire swath of our country that has been inculcated with theories of White supremacy and superiority \u2013 and Black inferiority. These theories and messages play out regularly on television, in communities like the one at issue in this case, and in the media. They reinforce anti-Black sentiment that will only worsen as state legislators introduce bills seeking to restrict schools from teaching Black history and the fullness of American history, and as school committee members and rogue parents fight to ban books that present the truth about our past and present.\u201d As Black History Month nears its end, Peniel E. Joseph noted this weekend\u2019s 10-year anniversary of the killing of Trayvon Martin and the convictions Thursday of the three former Minneapolis police officers for depriving George Floyd of his civil rights by showing deliberate indifference to his medical needs as another officer, Derek Chauvin, kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than 9 minutes and killed him. \u201cTrayvon Martin died in a country that would re-elect Barack Obama but proved unable to hold anyone accountable for the lost life of a Black teenager in Florida visiting his father,\u201d Joseph wrote. \u201cThe recent verdicts against police accused of killing Black people exemplifies one kind of hard-won progress since the death of Trayvon Martin \u2013 as does the elevation of previously marginalized Black voices to the upper echelons of American power. Racial progress continues its unsteady, sometimes vertiginous, movement alongside of the politics of backlash and intolerance.  But none of this \u2014 the political and racial reckoning of 2020 and the backlash against this awakening \u2014 would have been possible without Trayvon Martin, who deserved so much more.\u201d David Daley: Black voters are being written out of US democracy Kara Alaimo: Why I\u2019m scared about mask mandate rollbacks Amy Bass: Women\u2019s soccer settlement is a landmark win for fairness Dean Obeidallah: \u2018Hillary Clinton Derangement Syndrome\u2019 is worse than ever AND\u2026 The disturbing images from Kyiv reminded Nicole Hemmer of a moment in her childhood. \u201cWe had only just gotten cable at our home in rural Indiana, and after school my brother and I would turn on CNN to see the sky over Baghdad filtered through night-vision lenses, bathed in a neon green color reminiscent of the glow sticks we liked to wave at the skating rink.\u201d It was 1991, and the US was leading the international coalition responding to Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. \u201cSoon our dinnertime conversations were peppered with talk of Scud missiles and General Norman Schwarzkopf (as German Americans, we quickly mastered his name) as we filled our parents in on the dramatic scenes we watched while they worked,\u201d Hemmer wrote. \u201cMy dad had little appetite for our reports. A reluctant Vietnam veteran, he had experienced the first televised US war as a combatant\u2026 but my dad\u2019s experience was not the norm. For most Americans, war has been a spectator event, watched in crowded theaters and quiet living rooms. The invasion of Ukraine is no different. Even though the media have changed \u2014 the current war is unfolding not just on cable news but also on TikTok and Twitter feeds \u2014 the act is the same: most of us consume wars rather than experience them.\u201d Social media has made war omnipresent and eased the spread of misinformation, Hemmer noted. \u201cAs we watch this conflict unfold on screens, Americans must commit to developing our own ethics about war and fostering a deeper knowledge of this region\u2019s geopolitics and its relationship to our own. Otherwise, the emotions raised by watching these images are breeding grounds for manipulation. And that\u2019s why, as scenes from the war wash over us, we should ensure we\u2019re not just consuming the war, but thinking deeply about what it means.\u201d",

View more opinion on CNN. Given the chance, former President Donald Trump took the headline-grabbing route and declared Russian leader Vladimir Putin \u201cvery savvy\u201d and his decision to roll his army into separatist-held parts of Ukraine \u201cgenius.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know if the former President could have said anything more disturbing as Russia bullies a much smaller country. But it\u2019s certain that as he sided with America\u2019s opponent, he was being true to himself. Good riddance Nord Stream 2. Now Europe has a golden opportunity Leaders of democracies on both sides of the Atlantic have condemned Putin\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified aggression. With his forces arrayed to Ukraine\u2019s north, east, and south, the autocrat talks about Ukraine\u2019s past status as a Russian colony as he gins up domestic support for war. Noting Putin\u2019s strategy of falsely calling his troops \u201cpeacekeepers,\u201d Trump told an interviewer, \u201cthat\u2019s pretty savvy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the strongest peace force I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere were more army tanks than I\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019re going to keep peace, all right.\u201d Trump has long admired strength above all else, and his new comments on Putin are fully consistent with his long-professed admiration for the Russian President. He offered no words of condemnation for a regime threatening the worst military conflict in Europe since World War II. Instead, Trump violated an unwritten rule by attacking our current President as he struggled to deal with the war against one of America\u2019s friends. Since everything is apparently about him, he claimed he would have handled this crisis better and took a further swipe at President Joe Biden, \u201cThis never would have happened with us,\u201d said Trump who then added, that Biden is a \u201cman that has no concept of what he\u2019s doing.\u201d World War II is an apt reference point for anyone seeking the roots of Trump\u2019s behavior. That war had ended the year before he was born, and it had shaped his mentor at the New York Military Academy, which he attended during his junior and senior high school years. Theodore Dobias had served as an enlisted man in the allies\u2019 ferocious campaign in Italy. When I interviewed him prior to his death in 2016, he said the \u201cthe blood, the screaming\u201d remained fresh in his mind. At NYMA he taught boys to be fighters who respected strength. Trump would tell me Dobias \u201cwould rough you up\u201d as he transmitted life lessons. Somebody needs to give Putin a history lesson As former President and current leader of the Republican Party, Trump seems to have taught his political followers to respect Putin\u2019s strength as he does. Trump\u2019s former secretary of state Mike Pompeo recently called Putin \u201cVery shrewd, very capable\u201d adding, \u201cI have enormous respect for him.\u201d Some in Congress and in the Trump-supporting commentariat either used the moment to attack Biden or take Russia\u2019s side in a conflict Putin began when he invaded Ukraine in 2014, simply seizing control of Crimea. To be fair to Pompeo, he has also painted Ukrainians as victims in this crisis, but the fact that any American leader would use this state of emergency to express admiration for Putin and to attack Biden is anathema to America\u2019s political tradition. As retired General Barry McCaffrey put it, Putin is a \u201cmurderous thug.\u201d Any praise for him should be compared with the old observation that the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini made Italy\u2019s trains run on time. (In fact, he didn\u2019t achieve this feat, but the expression has been used to justify admiration for strongmen.) If anything could be more un-American than offering praise for an authoritarian as he invades a weaker democratic nation that is friendly to the United States, it might be adding to this indecency a bit of whining about personal political concerns. Yes, in the same interview Trump repeated his Big Lie about being cheated out of reelection in 2020. \u201cWell, what went wrong was a rigged election,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWhat went wrong is a candidate that shouldn\u2019t be there and a man that has no concept of what he\u2019s doing.\u201d  In addition to training much of the GOP to echo his Big Lie, Trump has led them to break with a long tradition of rallying behind the president in times of international conflict. With Biden repositioning our military to defend NATO allies that border Ukraine, America is clearly not on Putin\u2019s side. Sadly, many prominent American politicians, led by Trump, seem to be. This current crisis is only the latest skirmish in which democracy, as represented by the US, is confronting a rising threat of autocracy. As the American-based Freedom House think tank puts it, freedom is \u201cunder pressure\u201d from around the world. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Trump, who has praised dictators many times, seems opposed to protecting certain democracies now. It is a travesty that demonstrates, once again, that he doesn\u2019t grasp what America stands for \u2013 democracy, freedom, peace \u2013 and he is leading others to stand with him.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cFellow-citizens, we cannot escape history,\u201d President Abraham Lincoln wrote in his 1862 message to legislators as the Civil War raged. \u201cWe of this Congress and this Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves \u2026 The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.\u201d Lincoln\u2019s words stand out on Presidents Day weekend, when history is being made from Beijing to Ukraine to the US. It\u2019s true, as L.P. Hartley wrote, that \u201cthe past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.\u201d But we visit that foreign country all the time. The uses and misuses of history are at the root of so many struggles playing out in American society and politics right now. A year ago in January, the San Francisco Unified School District voted to rename 44 schools, eliminating ones memorializing Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Paul Revere and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, for a variety of reasons. The school board reversed itself in April after criticism from parents, the mayor and the San Francisco Chronicle. The debacle was only one of the factors behind last week\u2019s recall election that bounced three school board members from their seats. Also at play, Nicole Hemmer wrote, were \u201cextended pandemic school closures \u2026 an attempt to move away from testing and GPA requirements for admission into high-ranking public schools, a growing achievement gap, an enormous budget deficit and, in the case of one school board member, the use of a racial slur in an anti-Asian rant\u2026\u201d \u201cDeep-pocketed, right-leaning donors shoveled money into the recall, while activists and media outlets began using language that lashed together the disparate dissatisfactions into a coherent message,\u201d observed Hemmer. \u201cDemocratic politicians often lack courage when backlash politics are in motion, as likely to jump on the outrage bandwagon as shrink into the shadows, waiting for it to blow over. But they and progressive activists have a responsibility to counter moral panics with narratives more rooted in reality and more concerned with those whose needs are being overlooked.\u201d In the Los Angeles Times, Mark Z. Barabak called Tuesday\u2019s recall \u201ca foreshock, a warning \u2013 as if Democrats needed any more of those \u2013 that November\u2019s midterm elections could be very bad indeed, as parents unsettled by two years of pandemic-related upheaval vent their frustrations at the polls.\u201d The recall was \u201ca landslide,\u201d wrote Henry Olsen in the Washington Post. \u201cBetween 72 and 79 percent of San Franciscans who voted opted to kick them out. Every region in the city voted against the three board members, including more than 80 percent in heavily Asian districts such as Chinatown, Richmond and Sunset. No one can credibly say this was a case of Republicans using imaginary issues to fan voter discontent.\u201d In June, San Francisco voters will choose whether to recall another official \u2013 District Attorney Chesa Boudin. As Jill Filipovic wrote, this week \u201cBoudin came forward with a stunning claim: That the San Francisco Police Department\u2019s crime lab uses DNA evidence obtained from rape kits and entered into a DNA database to try to identify suspects in other crimes \u2026 Whatever is ultimately determined about the police department\u2019s lab, the damage may already be done. If rape survivors believe that the evidence collected in their rape kits could be used against them, that\u2019s one more reason on an already-long list to not trust the criminal justice system \u2013 or seek justice at all.\u201d Ron Brownstein wrote for CNN Politics that \u201cthe pressures of the coronavirus pandemic are reconfiguring the politics of education, dividing Democrats and creating new openings for Republicans.\u201d The key factor, he observed, is \u201can aggressive drive by Republicans to censor how public school teachers talk about race, gender, sexual orientation and other sensitive topics. That effort amounts to the most intrusive attempt to set legislative limits on the specific content of classroom instruction since the spate of state laws barring the teaching of evolution during the 1920s and the anti-Communist loyalty oaths for teachers that proliferated during the Joe McCarthy era after World War II.\u201d  Reflecting on Black History Month, Dant\u00e9 Stewart noted, \u201cThere are those who seem to think our lives are just lessons, somehow reducing us to helping White people to \u2018get it.\u2019 My mind cannot escape the simple fact that so many people ran to our books and our art or to the streets in 2020, believing that simply reading or marching would somehow magically change the White supremacist power structure so pervasive in our country without fundamental change in how we live together.\u201d \u201cJust two years later, after all the anti-racist work and organizing, we are dealing once again with White backlash on one hand, and White exhaustion on the other. Some want to erase us. Others want to control us. This misses the power of our living. We neither must be perfect or in performance to stay alive. We neither must be \u2018exceptional\u2019 or \u2018superhuman.\u2019 None of that is necessary. The power is that we are here\u2026\u201d Complicating the picture for Democrats in the midterm elections, Justin Gest wrote, is their growing fear that a substantial number of Latino voters are open to supporting Republicans. \u201cContrary to their monolithic treatment by many Americans, Latinos have always been very diverse \u2013 economically, culturally and in their ethnic and national origins. But, politically speaking, they were reliably Democratic.\u201d \u201cThat may no longer be true. In an era when conservative politics is acutely nationalist and consumed by a sense of cultural threat, a number of new polls show Latino voters growing more Republican.\u201d Voters this year will make fateful choices about the future of American elections, according to the officials who manage the voting process in two states. California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber and Jocelyn Benson, who holds the equivalent post in Michigan, wrote, \u201cthere are already nearly two dozen candidates running to be the chief election officer in their state who question the legitimacy of President Biden\u2019s win in 2020 and support efforts to both restrict access to the ballot and institute changes that would allow officials to invalidate or overturn results at will.\u201d \u201cOne has called for the dissolution of the bipartisan Wisconsin Election Commission, which fairly administers elections in the Badger State; another proposed a bill in the Arizona state legislature that would allow that partisan body to simply overrule a secretary of state\u2019s decision to officially certify the results of an election.\u201d Healing a divided nation is a huge challenge. In his new book on Lincoln\u2019s plans for peace after the Civil War, John Avlon writes that the 16th president\u2019s second inaugural address in 1865 cast him as \u201ca prophet of reconciliation\u201d who urged his nation \u201cto transcend all the dualities that divided it: North and South, black and white, free and unfree \u2013 carrying forward recognition of our common humanity into the wider world\u2026so that the promise of the United States might be redeemed and serve as a beacon of universal freedom.\u201d No one outside the Kremlin knows what Vladimir Putin will do with the enormous military force assembled on the borders of Ukraine. \u201cThis is probably the largest accretion of firepower seen in Europe for 40 years,\u201d The Economist has reported. \u201cRussia has activated units from every corner of its territory. Even the Eastern Military District, an administrative zone that stretches to the North Korean border, has been virtually emptied out, with most of its forces sent to Belarus.\u201d Whatever happens, \u201cthere\u2019s only one thing we know with certainty about how a war would play out in Ukraine: it would be unpredictable,\u201d  Frida Ghitis wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to unfold precisely as military planners predict, no matter how detailed and well thought-out they might be. \u2026 It\u2019s the geopolitical manifestation of the wisdom famously imparted by former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson: \u2018Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u2019\u201d In the New York Times, Thomas L. Friedman argued that \u201cif Vladimir Putin opts to back away from invading Ukraine, even temporarily, it\u2019s because Joe Biden \u2013 that guy whose right-wing critics suggest is so deep in dementia he wouldn\u2019t know Kyiv from Kansas or AARP from NATO \u2013 has matched every Putin chess move with an effective counter of his own.\u201d The threat to Ukraine, Friedman wrote, has been \u201can electroshock to the heart of the NATO alliance, a bolt that brought it out of its sclerosis like nothing else since the end of the Cold War.\u201d Still, he noted, Putin could launch an invasion. What the Russian president fears most of all, in Friedman\u2019s view is not the unlikely prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, but rather \u201cthe expansion of the E.U.\u2019s sphere of influence and the prospect that it would midwife a decent, democratic, free-market Ukraine that would every day say to the Russian people, \u2018This is what you could be without Putin.\u2019\u201d As a child, ice dancer Kaitlyn Weaver dreamed of reaching the Olympics \u2013 and she realized that goal competing for Canada at the 2014 and 2018 Games. Watching the figure skating competition at this year\u2019s Beijing Games amid the controversy over Russian athlete Kamila Valieva\u2019s positive drug test has been painful for Weaver and so many others, not least Valieva herself. The 15-year-old Russian skater was allowed to compete in the individual event Thursday, but instead of leading the field as many had expected, she stumbled, fell and finished fourth. \u201cAn ethereal, beloved sport intertwined with a storied past of scandal and controversy, figure skating is as confusing as it is beautiful,\u201d wrote Weaver. \u201cLoss of faith in knowing that fair play will prevail has damaged our sport and our morale. And while Russia has laid the foundation for much of our sport\u2019s history, it is also seemingly at the root of every disparaging news headline.\u201d If a country can\u2019t follow the rules, Weaver observed, \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t be allowed to participate at all. This travesty of an Olympic event we are finding ourselves in has had many failures. The first was not banning Russia after the findings of systemic, state-sponsored doping during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. Proof of cheating, doping, switched out samples through a hole in the wall, and government funding were all found to be true. If you haven\u2019t watched the movie \u2018Icarus,\u2019 the depth of manipulation and threats might shock you. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it makes you want to turn your back on sport altogether.\u201d For more: Amy Bass: Even if Kamila Valieva wins, she loses. The Omicron wave has receded in most of the US, and leaders in government and business now have to manage the aftermath. \u201cWhile rolling back precautionary policies makes sense right now as Covid-19 cases decline and stabilize, it must be stressed that the only way it is safe to return to normal life is with a contingency plan for masking back up if the next variant of concern warrants it,\u201d wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert. The argument for \u201cliving with Covid\u201d has been that we all take risks, from driving cars to eating rare hamburgers to eating raw cookie dough, and that the possibility of getting the coronavirus is just another risk. Sepkowitz called this a \u201ccontinued confusion between advice given for individual health and advice given for public health. \u2026 Undercooked chicken is not contagious.

The son of the Queen of the United Kingdom \u2013 a man who is royalty \u2013 was stripped of his privileges by his own mother after being accused of sexual misconduct and made to account for his behavior in a foreign court, though he ended up settling with Giuffre out of court.\u201d \u201cThis sends a deafening message to other powerful men: No privileges in the world will enable you to use your power to dodge allegations of sexual abuse \u2026 the fact that he has essentially faced royal excommunication, a foreign civil trial and has been made to pay a settlement to her can only have put many other men on notice \u2013 and signals to other women who have been victims of sexual abuse that their voices will be heard.\u201d Never mind the dramatic football game and the widely praised halftime show. For many, the most anticipated parts of the Super Bowl this year, as always, were the ads. In Tim Calkins\u2019 view, the key takeaway of the commercials was that \u201cAmericans are fatigued by the pandemic, and are looking forward to brighter days ahead.\u201d Writing for CNN Business Perspectives, he noted, \u201cMost years, the Super Bowl is a mix of humorous, cheerful spots and more thoughtful, emotional advertising. For every funny Bud Light spot, there is typically a more serious ad, like Google\u2019s wistful \u201cLoretta\u201d spot in 2020, or Airbnb\u2019s \u201cWe Accept\u201d ad from 2017. This year, the tone was relentlessly upbeat. Only a few advertisers tried to address anything remotely serious \u2026 \u201cThere was almost no mention of the pandemic, aside from an ad from testing company Cue. There were no masks, no thank-yous to the first responders, no reminders to get a booster. There weren\u2019t even subtle references to it\u2026\u201d What was new? \u201cA slew of ads for two technologies that are transforming the country and becoming more widely accepted: crypto and electric vehicles.\u201d Former President Donald Trump suffered a string of reversals this week: documents revealed that his longtime accounting firm said it would stop working with the Trump organization and noted that 10 years of his company\u2019s financial statements could no longer be relied on; a judge ruled that Trump and several of his children would have to give depositions in the investigation of his business empire\u2019s finances by New York\u2019s attorney general; and another judge said Trump couldn\u2019t automatically claim immunity in lawsuits regarding the January 6 Capitol riot. The \u201ccourt rulings are forcing Donald Trump to think about a future when the world will learn more truths about the former president than it has ever known, and he may suffer crushing injuries to his mystique and his bottom line,\u201d wrote Michael D\u2019Antonio. \u201cThe fight over the truth about Trump\u2019s wealth and business operations was always going to become a family affair. As soon as they became adults, Trump made his children top executives. Nestled behind the walls of secrecy granted to privately-held firms, they were trusted to do business his way, which meant they polished the image of wealth and success that was central to his identity.\u201d Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons and Maggie Siddiqi: Why one Tennessee couple\u2019s struggle to adopt should set off alarm bells Amit Paley and Joe Saunders: Florida\u2019s \u2018don\u2019t say gay bill\u2019 is cruel and dangerous Erik Lundh: Why inflation is about to peak Janneke Ratcliffe: How we can solve the nation\u2019s affordable housing crisis And\u2026 When Joe Biden took the oath of office as President last year in the midst of a pandemic, after an insurrection at the Capitol and at a time when millions of Americans were demanding racial justice, some analysts likened the stakes of the moment to the start of Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s presidency following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Historian Tim Naftali noted that Johnson and Biden \u201cboth believed that the country craved more than the competent pragmatism that had defined their long tenures as US senators. Both men thought the national traumas that gave birth to their presidencies would create a magnetic pull to the left.\u201d (A CNN series \u201cLBJ: Triumph and Tragedy\u201d begins Sunday at 9 p.m. ET.) \u201cBut the legislative comparison stops there: with ambition, not achievement,\u201d Naftali wrote. Although Biden can take credit for the infrastructure bill and his Covid relief package, they pale in comparison to the rush of legislation under Johnson, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, the Voting Rights Act and the \u201cwar on poverty.\u201d It\u2019s not Biden\u2019s fault. Last year \u201cwasn\u2019t 1965\u201d and \u201cthis isn\u2019t like the moment that LBJ mastered so brilliantly. It is much, much harder, politically, and Joe Biden is not LBJ. Instead, Biden should be assessed on his own terms and in the context of his own time. With almost no margin for error in either House of Congress, an ideologically diverse (let alone iconoclastic) caucus, a partisan Republican bloc, and amid a politically divisive pandemic, it is remarkable Biden got much of anything passed\u2026\u201d \u201cThe President and his congressional allies might keep that in mind as they consider how to make effective use of the power they do have before the midterms this November, when they will face the voters again and ask for more.\u201d",

Andelman, a contributor to CNN, twice winner of the Deadline Club Award, is a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor, author of \u201cA Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen\u201d and the Substack blog Andelman Unleashed. He formerly was a correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Europe and Asia. The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion on CNN. If there was one indication that French President Emmanuel Macron may be well on his way to replacing former German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the leading figure in Western Europe, it is his expanding relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Macron meets Putin face-to-face in Moscow on Monday before heading to Kyiv the following day for another in-person session with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 all while as many as 100,000 Russian troops remain poised on Ukraine\u2019s frontiers. It\u2019s all part of Macron\u2019s bid to turn what had been a warm relationship with the Russian leader into a full-fledged truce that would end Europe\u2019s brush with an all-out war. The timing could work in Macron\u2019s favor. Putin will return home from his visit to Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the opening of the Beijing Olympics with an agreement on a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership between the two countries, \u201csuperior to political and military alliances of the Cold War era.\u201d But of even greater importance to Putin is a 30-year contract for Russian natural gas to be paid for in euros \u2013 a nice cushion against any moves by the West to strangle his economy. Why Germany is so vulnerable to Russian blackmail But Macron started laying the groundwork for his Moscow visit long before setting foot on Russian soil. Macron has had five phone conversations with Putin since mid-December, according to the Elys\u00e9e Palace. Meanwhile, the Kremlin\u2019s records of Putin\u2019s conversations show that in the past two months of accelerating tensions on the border with Ukraine, the Russian leader has spoken just twice each with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden. Even with his close ally, Belarus\u2019 like-minded dictator Alexander Lukashenko, into whose country he\u2019s moved tens of thousands of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine, Putin has recorded only two conversations \u2013 the last on January 8. What that means in terms of Macron\u2019s ability to arrive at some solution to hold off a Russian invasion of Ukraine is, of course, impossible to predict. Indeed, Macron currently has a standing at this moment like no other. For the first six months this year, France has the rotating presidency of the European Union. So at least until the presidential elections in France in April, or if he is re-elected, through the end of France\u2019s mandate in June, it is quite clear that Macron intends to play to the hilt the authoritative role that he\u2019s drawn. Indeed, Macron told French journalist Fran\u00e7ois Clemenceau, a descendant of the World War I French prime minister Georges Clemenceau, that he would not return home to Paris until he\u2019d received at least a signal of a \u201cde-escalation,\u201d adding, \u201cthen we will discuss the terms of the de-escalation.\u201d There is a strong precedent for talks between Putin and whoever in the West serves as his whisperer of the moment. For years, that post was held by Merkel. Putin and Merkel had shared interests and history. The former chancellor grew up in what was then Soviet-controlled East Germany, where Putin served as a KGB officer in Dresden. Putin is quite comfortable speaking German and with their contiguous backgrounds, talked easily, shifting back and forth in the two languages. Josh Hawley joins Tucker Carlson in ripping a gash in GOP's Ukraine stance In 2014, the year Putin seized Crimea from Ukraine, Merkel and Putin held 35 conversations \u2013 just through the month of September. That\u2019s more than three times the number with both former President Barack Obama (10) and almost six times the number with former British Prime Minister David Cameron (six). While Merkel was clearly unable to dissuade the Russian leader from retaining Crimea, Russian moves into the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine never progressed much beyond extended skirmishes in territory that still remains controlled by Kyiv. Still, Merkel never wavered in her respect for the sanctions imposed by the West or her support for Putin\u2019s expulsion from the G8 group of major powers, which still rankles Putin enormously. Now, it comes down to Macron. Can he manage somehow to uncork the same magic bottle that held Putin so enthralled? There has always been a certain fascination among Russian leaders with France, back to the days of the czars when French was the language of the royal court. Moreover, there is a striking precedent to the current crisis. In 2008, a previous French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, played quite an effective role as peacemaker when Russia invaded Georgia, rushing off to the Kremlin, then on to Georgia. As it happens, Sarkozy then held the same title as Macron today \u2013 the rotating presidency of the European Union which has now circled through the continent\u2019s 27 nations and returned, stunningly, to France at this epiphanic moment. Putin must recognize in Macron, as he did with Sarkozy, an individual with a presence and dynamism unlike most other European leaders today. This is something Putin respects. Still, so as not to insult the German leader Olaf Scholz, on Friday, Putin did finally schedule a meeting with him on February 15, which could suggest he has no plan to invade Ukraine before then. Why China's Olympics matter to Putin Europe needs a new leader at this moment. As of now, Merkel\u2019s special powers do not appear to have been transferred to her successor, Scholz, with whom Putin has spoken only once in the past two months \u2013 on December 21, just after he hung up the phone with Macron for their second conversation in a week. So there has been no regular contact between a German and Russian leader since Merkel left office in early December \u2013 especially none of the regular contact Merkel encouraged, even in the absence of some crisis of the moment. One of her top military aides once told me that she picked up the phone and called Putin frequently simply so that he would hear another voice different from those in the Kremlin who were whispering their own, often antithetical agendas routinely. Putin respected her toughness and her longevity in office. There is little of that toughness in Scholz, sitting atop an at best shaky coalition. In the face of this present East-West crisis, Macron has delayed his official entry into the French presidential sweepstakes, watching a growing list of competitors that\u2019s reached at least three dozen enter the fray. It\u2019s worth noting that Sarkozy never managed to win re-election after his mediation in Georgia. Now, Macron is determined to build a new vision as his heritage, which he enunciated most recently in his inaugural address to the European Parliament on January 19, observing that \u201cEurope needs to build a collective security order on our continent \u2013 a strategic reinforcement of our Europe as a power of peace, a balancing power, particularly in its dialogue with Russia.\u201d And Putin, perhaps seeing in this aspiration a ready-made device to separate the United States from Europe, seems inclined to assist as a means toward his own end. Of course, if this apparent sleight-of-hand by Macron \u2013 carving a separate path forward for Europe \u2013 leads to placing any kind of restraint on Putin\u2019s more bellicose ambitions, all the better.  So, should Biden step back just a bit and see if there really is something brewing between Putin and Macron? There is every reason to embrace and encourage the diplomatic route that Macron is seeking to forge. But perhaps there is simply a need for greater coordination between the French way of diplomacy and the heavy tread of American militarism. A senior Elys\u00e9e official observed Friday that Macron would be seeking to build a new consensus based on goodwill and confidence with his interlocutor. Now, more than ever, the world needs a Putin-whisperer.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. On January 28, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres asked nations around the world to lay down their weapons and observe an Olympic Truce from seven days before the Beijing Games until seven days after the end of the Paralympic Games. \u201cThrough the power of sports and the Olympic ideal, let us build a culture of peace,\u201d he said. The Olympic truce dates back almost 3,000 years to the early days of the ancient games when the leaders of three Greek city-states agreed to limit their battles. In modern times, the truce has been invoked as a universal goal by the UN regularly since 1993. But the treaty originally didn\u2019t actually aim to stop all wars, only to safeguard the athletes as they traveled to and competed at Olympia, David C. Young pointed out in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. As the Winter Olympics proceed in China this year, Guterres\u2019 worthy aspiration is being tested \u2013 we\u2019ll find out whether this year\u2019s truce may prove as limited as the earliest ones were. Worth noting: On the day of the opening ceremony the last time the Games were held in Beijing, in 2008, Russia invaded Georgia. This year\u2019s games began while a huge force of Russian troops remained perched on the Ukraine border and with US President Joe Biden sending troops to Eastern Europe. China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin met Friday before the opening ceremony in a show of harmony between the US rivals, agreeing, in general, to \u201cstep up coordination and cooperation in international affairs\u201d and specifically to oppose NATO expansion. In some ways, the threat of war overshadowed the start of the Olympics. As Amy Bass noted, \u201cBefore competition even began, Ukrainian officials warned its athletes to avoid social contact with members of the Russian team \u2026 Last August in Tokyo, Ukrainian Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who took bronze in the high jump, drew the ire of many back home for a celebratory photo with Russia\u2019s Mariya Lasitskene, the gold medalist in the event.\u201d \u201cThe political tensions between the two countries have, without question, leaked into China\u2019s \u2018closed loop\u2019 Olympic bubble, regardless of (IOC President Thomas) Bach\u2019s appeal in his welcoming remarks to \u2018all political authorities across the world (to) observe your commitment to this Olympic truce.\u2019 Bach\u2019s pleas match those of just about every other IOC leader in history \u2013 including Avery Brundage, who in 1936 shunned the idea of a Berlin boycott of the games hosted by Nazi Germany because \u2018the Olympic Games belong to the athletes and not to the politicians.\u201d\u2019 For more: Mark Clifford: This is what victory at the Beijing Games looks like Responding to Putin\u2019s massing of troops, \u201cBiden has launched a muscular diplomatic offensive, coordinated with NATO allies and held high-level talks with Russian officials, while warning of stiff economic sanctions and boosting the military defenses of Ukraine and now of the United States\u2019 allies in Eastern Europe, such as Romania and Poland,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. Leading Senate Republicans backed Biden\u2019s moves while Trumpists adopted positions more sympathetic to Russia. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri supported a key demand of Putin \u2013 that the US oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO. \u201cHawley has staked his position,\u201d Ghitis observed. \u201cHe\u2019s betting that the Republican Party, with or without Trump, will follow a Trumpian path to victory. He wants that to be his victory, too, even if it means Ukraine comes under Putin\u2019s heel and autocracy continues spreading across the globe.\u201d Biden\u2019s aggressive response to the crisis is gaining praise in Europe. In the Financial Times, Edward Luce wrote that \u201cby threatening Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, Putin has done something Biden could not on his own \u2013 unite the west.\u201d The President also approved a special forces raid in Syria this week that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. The week \u201cseemed like quite an about-face for the President,\u201d wrote Peter Bergen. \u201cOver the past decade, Biden has been far more cautious about deploying troops or using force. Biden pulled all US troops out of Afghanistan in August, which triggered the departure of thousands of allied NATO soldiers and American contractors, precipitating the takeover of the country by the Taliban.\u201d And as vice president, Biden cautioned President Barack Obama against authorizing the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the head of al Qaeda. For more: Rafael Loss: Why Germany is the weakest link in Europe\u2019s chain against Putin A replacement for retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will be nominated this month, if Biden meets his own deadline for the pick. One potential choice, US District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs, already has support from both sides of the aisle \u2013 from Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. James Clyburn \u2013 in her home state of South Carolina. Bakari Sellers, who has represented clients in Childs\u2019 courtroom, called her \u201ca judge without any air of pretension.\u201d  \u201cShe is like so many Americans who have worked incredibly hard to achieve success in life,\u201d Sellers wrote. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it time we put someone on the bench who reflects our experiences? The daughter of a police officer, who died when she was just a teenager, and a personnel manager for Bell Telephone, she\u2019s faced the same adversity so many of us have.\u201d Unlike the current Supreme Court justices, Child has experience as a judge in state courts. \u201cAt a time when faith in our democratic institutions is being eroded by charges of tone-deafness and elitism, don\u2019t we deserve a Supreme Court nominee who stands not above us, but among us?\u201d Another possible choice, US Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, impressed CNN legal analyst Elie Honig for her handling of the challenge to a US House of Representatives subpoena of former President Donald Trump\u2019s White House counsel Don McGahn. \u201cUltimately, Jackson issued a thorough \u2013 exhaustive, even \u2013 ruling that ran 118 pages. Her decision was deeply researched, impeccably written and incisive,\u201d Honig wrote, describing her as \u201ca truly exceptional federal judge.\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, was among the prominent Republicans criticizing Biden for pledging to nominate a Black woman to the court, saying it tells other Americans, \u201cYou are ineligible.\u201d Brandon Tensley wrote that \u201cConservatives\u2019 characterizations of President Joe Biden\u2019s commitment to nominate a Black woman to the US Supreme Court have been as ridiculous as they\u2019ve been predictable \u2026 the tub-thumping about Biden\u2019s position on a still-to-be-named nominee does two things: It hides the fact that conservatives also have long embraced picks\u2019 identities, and ignores the substantive value of injecting more diversity into the judiciary.\u201d The week began with condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans of Trump\u2019s suggestion that he could consider pardoning some January 6 rioters if he is elected president in 2024. For some, it was even more troubling that at his rally last weekend, he also threatened prosecutors investigating him with massive demonstrations if they \u201cdo anything wrong or illegal.\u201d The week ended with the Republican National Committee censuring two members of Congress who dared to call out Trump for his election lies and serve on the House select committee investigating January 6. Dean Obeidallah wrote, \u201cThink back to December 2020, when Trump called for a protest because he felt he\u2019d been \u2018wronged\u2019 with the 2020 election results \u2013 the end result was the deadly Capitol attack. Even as his role in that outcome is investigated, Trump obviously knows how that played out. That\u2019s why common sense says Trump now calling for his supporters to potentially amass again in huge numbers to help him right any perceived wrongs should ring alarm bells. That\u2019s especially true given Trump\u2019s apparent message to his supporters on Saturday that if you commit acts of violence in his name, he will consider pardoning you if he ever becomes president again.\u201d For more: Michael D\u2019Antonio: Trump\u2019s growing recklessness is a ticking time bomb Elie Honig: The Jan. 6 committee is facing a stark choice Ever since 1976, US presidents have designated the month of February as a time to recognize Black history. But this year, as Peniel E. Joseph noted, \u201cBlack History Month commemorations will unfold alongside efforts in numerous states to ban the teaching of its content. Efforts that purport to bar the teaching of \u2018Critical Race Theory\u2019 have evolved into a full-scale assault, with Republican lawmakers unleashing attacks on Black History under the guise of protecting White children from \u2018discomfort.\u2019\u201d \u201cEfforts to cancel Black history because it\u2019s too uncomfortable also reflect mainstream media narratives centering the anger and indignation of White parents regarding the teaching of Black history in public education. This has largely erased the perspective of Black parents. As one Black mother of three from Charlottesville, Virginia, told The Washington Post, \u2018They say, \u201cOur children are too young to hear about racism.\u201d Who is \u201cour\u201d children? I don\u2019t remember a day of my life when I wasn\u2019t taught about racism, or learning about it through just existing.\u2019\u201d Joan Salter was born in Brussels, the child of Polish Jews. Her mother\u2019s family was murdered in the Treblinika death camp and her father\u2019s in Belzec. \u201cIt was thanks to a tip-off from a police officer that deportations of women and children were due to start, that my mother managed to smuggle us out of Paris in a laundry van in the dead of night,\u201d Salter wrote. She was shipped to the US in 1943 as a child survivor. Salter spoke out this week after Whoopi Goldberg apologized for saying the Nazi persecution of the Jews had nothing to do with race. \u201cI do not believe that Goldberg was deliberately seeking to distort the Holocaust. I find it unfortunate, however, that her comments represent a futile attempt to oversimplify a very complicated situation \u2013 the annihilation of an entire group of people, the Jews \u2013 in racial terms,\u201d Salter observed. \u201cThe reality is that Nazis declared Jews and other groups like the Romani and Sinti as inferior to their own supposedly superior \u2018Aryan race.\u2019 In the years leading to the Holocaust, Nazis referred to Jews as \u2018rats.\u2019 And it is for this one reason that Jews were targeted for destruction. Six million of my people were murdered simply for who they were.\u201d For more: Jill Filipovic: The bigger problem behind Whoopi Goldberg and Ron DeSantis\u2019 incendiary comments Under different circumstances, a new series streaming on Hulu could be applauded for foregrounding the story of a woman victimized. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s being delivered to viewers, wrote Sara Stewart: \u201cThis eight-episode show about the infamous 1995 Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape is, at its core, about a violation of privacy. It\u2019s the story of a honeymoon videotape the famous couple never wanted anyone to see, stolen and distributed at great profit to various men. And the story of that piracy is now being sold as a TV series \u2026 at great profit to the team who made it. Without the consent of the woman at its center \u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible,\u201d wrote Stewart, \u201cthat a team of people making a show in 2021, in the age of #MeToo, would be this oblivious to the importance of getting consent \u2013 especially when their series is entirely about the importance of consent.\u201d At week\u2019s end, Boris Johnson was still the UK\u2019s prime minister but there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s been badly weakened by the revelations of frequent alcohol-fueled parties at 10 Downing Street and other government buildings while the nation was on lockdown. Portions of a report by civil servant Sue Gray put it in classically understated language: \u201cSome of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.\u201d Holly Thomas wrote, \u201cAs Johnson probably realizes, it isn\u2019t just the fact of our nation\u2019s cabin crew boozing their way through the pandemic that offends the British populace.\u201d \u201cThe real insult is that while we abstained, he and his colleagues did not. And incredible though it is that so many people shouldering huge professional responsibilities were prepared to attend these potentially dangerous gatherings, the ingrained presenteeism in Britain when bosses or colleagues hit the bar has always come at a heavy price \u2026\u201d \u201cRegular and excessive bouts of group drinking are chronic throughout British working culture \u2013 and the political world of Westminster is an exaggerated caricature of what goes on elsewhere. In non-lockdown times, Whitehall pubs spill onto the streets from 6 p.m. onward \u2013 and overflow even more with proximity to the Houses of Parliament. Drinking carries on until late every weekday. Junior advisers know the value of showing up for pints if they want to endear themselves to their superiors and as a result, journalists cruising for stories do the same, habitually stalking the House of Commons\u2019 heavily subsidized bars.\u201d For more: Rosa Prince: The Boris Johnson Party is over. But the hangover is just beginning Michael Fanone, a former Washington, DC, police officer who was badly injured defending the Capitol on January 6, traveled to New York for the funeral of NYPD Officer Jason Rivera, one of two officers killed responding to a domestic disturbance call last month. Fanone, who wanted \u201cto honor their sacrifice and grieve alongside my peers,\u201d cited former police officer and current New York Mayor Eric Adams\u2019s remark, \u201cOnce a cop, always a cop. It never goes away.\u201d Fanone argued that \u201cfar too many of our elected leaders on both sides of the political aisle have placed politics and pandering above our public safety. All of us, as partners in our criminal justice system, must set clear goals and expectations for each of our law enforcement officers through open and honest dialogue and then work together to meet them.\u201d \u201cAdams understands this, as evidenced by his administration\u2019s recently released \u2018blueprint to end gun violence,\u2019 a 15-page plan which includes proposals to detect and confiscate illegal guns, create new public safety units and provide mental health resources and other social programs.\u201d President Biden flew to New York Thursday to meet with Adams, as Julian Zelizer noted. \u201cThe Biden administration is acknowledging the problem and taking steps to show it can be tough on crime. This visit also appears to be an attempt to push back against progressives who are calling to \u2018defund the police,\u2019 and neutralize any GOP attacks on Democrats for being soft on crime.\u201d But Zelizer wrote that the administration shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the genuine issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cA President who tries to game out exactly what policy positions will win the elusive moderate vote in our era of polarization is taking on a fool\u2019s errand. One thing that Biden can do, however, is take a genuine stand and promote policies that address racism in policing, sentencing and prisons because it is the right thing to do.\u201d For more: Jeff Asher: We need to understand America\u2019s spike in murders Former NFL coach Brian Flores confronted the NFL last week with a blockbuster lawsuit. \u201cNo one expected Flores, who seemed to have a long career in front of him at the age of 40, to disrupt the NFL,\u201d wrote Roxanne Jones. \u201cBut disrupt he did.\u201d Flores, \u201cfed up with his treatment and that of other Black executives, filed a class-action lawsuit against the NFL and three teams Tuesday alleging racial discrimination.

As Nicole Hemmer wrote, \u201cUnlike the lose-yourself-for-hours games that dominated the early pandemic months, from low-tech jigsaw puzzles to the omnipresent Animal Crossing, Wordle meets the needs of a mostly open, still-chaotic country that has refilled its empty calendars but still faces the disruptions of constant testing and unexpected closures and quarantines.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Rafael Loss (@_RafaelLoss) is an expert on European security and defense policy at the European Council on Foreign Relations. He is based in Berlin. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The first hundred days are proving to be particularly unforgiving for Germany\u2019s first government of the post-Merkel era. Since assuming office December 8, Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his cabinet have had to confront an unprecedented Russian troop buildup along the border of Ukraine and the prospect of major war in Europe. To date, their performance does not inspire confidence about Germany\u2019s ability to lead in this moment of crisis. Roughly half of Germany\u2019s natural gas imports come from Russia. That reliance will become increasingly important in coming years as Germany embarks on a simultaneous phaseout from coal and nuclear energy. Russia is also an important destination for German exports. And for historical reasons, German leaders have long desired close relations with Russia. Slowly but surely, Germany has maneuvered itself into a position of vulnerability vis-\u00e0-vis the Kremlin. Germany\u2019s complicated relationship with Russia is unique among its European neighbors. Germany\u2019s first Social Democratic (SPD) chancellor, Willy Brandt, pursued d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union from 1969. Brandt\u2019s \u201cOstpolitik\u201d \u2013 the normalization of relations between West Germany and Eastern Europe \u2013 paved the way for the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, which recognized the national borders of post-war Europe. This was an important goal for Soviet leaders anxious about shoring up their Eastern European satellites. But it also gave dissidents and civil rights activists in the Soviet empire a manifesto for liberal reform. But Russia in 2022 \u2013 as has become abundantly clear from its demands for a wholesale revision of the European security order it put in front of the United States and NATO in December \u2013 is a very different beast to the Soviet Union of the late Cold War, which sought political consolidation and hard cash. Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is also not interested in joining the political West, as it appeared to be during the 1990s. Instead, the Russian President detests America\u2019s continued presence in Europe as epitomized by the NATO alliance. He sees the European Union as weak and divided and liberal democracy as doomed to fail. Putin first led the charge against the United States\u2019 global hegemony at the Munich Security Conference in 2007. In 2014, only months after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, Putin gave a speech at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. The theme of the conference on international politics was: \u201cNew Rules or a Game without Rules?\u201d The specter of renewed aggression against Ukraine is supposed to force an answer now. And it calls into question Germany\u2019s Russia policy of the past two decades. German governments since 2000 \u2013 led by Social Democrat Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who has close personal and business ties to Russia, and then by Christian Democrat Angela Merkel \u2013 sought to deepen relations for mutual benefit, prosperity and stability. Putin, meanwhile. identified and cultivated pressure points to weaponize these interdependencies. The Russian President also skillfully manipulates German guilt. He benefits from the fact that many Germans associate the atrocities Nazi Germany committed against Eastern Europeans largely with Russia. Although they suffered proportionately more deaths and greater destruction, Poles, Belarussians, and Ukrainians in turn receive little empathy. Largely ignored by Germans is the price Eastern Europeans paid for German-Soviet collaboration during World War II and the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe from 1945. Why China's Olympics matter to Putin Germany is thus both most vulnerable to Russian blackmail and most willing to see Putin as deserving respect and understanding. He is sometimes seen as both a powerful leader and a victim of circumstances backed into a corner by unrelenting Western pressure. This is not a majority view in German government or policy elites. But occasionally, important people, such as Germany\u2019s navy chief, express such sympathies for Putin (and the chief was forced to resign shortly afterward). It underlines why principled leadership is so important, and the lack of German leadership is so damaging, for Western efforts to dissuade Moscow from renewed aggression against Ukraine. Still, after assuming office in December, Scholz reiterated his claim that the German-Russian gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 was a purely \u201cprivate-sector project\u201d and that it should not be mixed up with political or geopolitical questions. Germany\u2019s new defense minister and the SPD general secretary backed Scholz, as did other political leaders who consider energy relations as an important channel for dialogue with Moscow. It took weeks of consultations with NATO and EU allies for the Chancellor to consider the pipeline as part of a deterrent sanctions package. It seemed as though Scholz needed to be dragged to this realization, which his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party, already shared with allies in Washington, Paris and Warsaw all along. Berlin is treading water on materiel support for Ukraine as well. When Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock of the Greens visited Kyiv in January, she offered a hydrogen partnership and German support for beefing up Ukraine\u2019s cyber defenses. In recent days, Germany announced it would sponsor a field hospital and send 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine \u2013 about as useful as sending \u201cpillows,\u201d quipped Kyiv\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, who is well known in Germany from his days as a heavyweight boxing champion. But arms transfers remain off the table. Baerbock explained this restrictive stance in reference to Germany\u2019s wartime history. Another foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, also from the Greens, defended the country\u2019s participation in NATO\u2019s military intervention in Kosovo in 1999 with an impassioned reference to German history, too: The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany obligated Germans to stand up to aggression. Arms transfers alone do not amount to a strategy to deal with the revisionist great power at Europe\u2019s doorstep. Unfortunately, nothing indicates that Germany is prepared to formulate and implement a long-term competitive strategy that accounts for Russia\u2019s desire to coerce Ukraine and other post-Soviet states into abandoning their Western aspirations.  The United States is focusing its attention on a rising China that is putting increasing pressure on the regional security order in the Indo-Pacific. France, although engulfed in a presidential election campaign, is proposing building blocks for what could evolve into a European strategy on Russia. Allies in Poland, Lithuania and elsewhere long for recognition of their evidently justified security concerns. Germany must step up. If it does not, a picture suggesting British military airplanes avoided German airspace en route to Ukraine might come to symbolize Germany\u2019s role in this crisis, and the rerouting of European security relations around Europe\u2019s center.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cYou keep me searchin\u2019 and I\u2019m growing old,\u201d sang Neil Young in one of his most famous hits, released 50 years ago. \u201cKeep me searchin\u2019 for a heart of gold.\u201d There was a flash of that quest for a better world last week when the 76-year-old rocker took a stand against Covid-19 vaccine misinformation. Young told Spotify to remove his music, Jill Filipovic wrote, \u201cif it continues to feature those who regularly disseminate lies and conspiracy theories about Covid-19.\u201d He cited Joe Rogan, who hosts the streaming platform\u2019s most popular podcast. The battle lines over truth and falsehood aren\u2019t just cutting across the political sphere, they are dividing people in media, music and sports. Filipovic noted, \u201cRogan claims his show is an intellectually honest exploration of ideas. The Covid misinformation Rogan is spreading is told as truth. And a startling number of people clearly believe it.\u201d She argued that Young is right and that Spotify \u201cshould draw the line at dangerous life-threatening conspiracy theories and the kind of misinformation that could result in unnecessary illness and death.\u201d At a rally against vaccine mandates in Washington, DC, last Sunday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u201cclaimed that the Biden administration\u2019s policies on vaccines were worse than the Nazis\u2019 persecution of the Jews, saying, \u2018Even in Hitler Germany (sic), you could, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland. You could hide in an attic, like Anne Frank did,\u2019\u201d wrote Peter Bergen. \u201cThe Biden administration\u2019s legitimate public health push for vaccine mandates to save an untold number of American lives is quite the opposite of the Nazis hunting down and killing 6 million Jews during the Holocaust,\u201d Bergen observed. \u201cThe use of safe vaccines by more than 200 million Americans is not a perversion of science as practiced by the Nazis, but a legitimate and approved use of medical science. And that\u2019s to say nothing of his reference to Anne Frank, who ultimately perished in Bergen-Belsen, a Nazi concentration camp.\u201d Kennedy later apologized for the Anne Frank reference.  When quarterback Aaron Rodgers\u2019 Green Bay Packers lost in the NFL playoffs last weekend, the discussion wasn\u2019t only about what happened on the field. \u201cRodgers\u2019 road from being one of the best-liked and most respected players in the league to being a target of derision shows how prevalent and polarizing Covid-19 misinformation has become,\u201d wrote Dean Obeidallah. \u201cRodgers did get \u2018canceled\u2019 \u2013 but it still wasn\u2019t by a \u2018woke mob.\u2019 Remember that the football star claimed last fall that \u2018the woke mob\u2019 was trying to \u2018cancel\u2019 him in response to misleading comments he\u2019d made about his Covid-19 vaccination status, as well as for peddling unproven ways to treat the coronavirus. Yet it wasn\u2019t until Saturday night, after the San Francisco 49ers pulled off a stunning upset to beat Rodgers and his favored Packers\u2026that it became clear just how much public support Rodgers has lost.\u201d For more on Covid-19: Dr. Kent Sepkowitz: A humble prediction for what comes after Omicron Kara Alaimo: What we\u2019re still not facing about parents\u2019 Covid anger Lauren Ghazal: If nurses are heroes, your heroes are in crisis Jillian Horton: Bari Weiss\u2019 decision to be \u2018done\u2019 with Covid is a slap in the face to health care workers Eight days after Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020, then-President Donald Trump walked into the White House\u2019s Rose Garden and introduced Amy Coney Barrett as his choice to fill the seat. Trump had promised to nominate conservatives to the Supreme Court and had already put Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the bench. The Republican-controlled Senate moved quickly to confirm Barrett just days before the 2020 election. The impending vacancy created by Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s announcement Thursday that he\u2019ll retire this summer is very different. Biden is taking more time to choose a judge with lifetime tenure, saying he will make his pick by the end of February. And more importantly, Breyer\u2019s replacement won\u2019t change the ideological balance of the court \u2013 unlike Barrett, who took the place of a liberal. Her confirmation gave conservatives a 6-3 advantage on the bench, raising the question of whether precedents like the one established by Roe v. Wade would be upheld. Still, Biden will make history by fulfilling his promise to appoint the first Black woman to the court. \u201cBy doing so, he will help correct generations of bias and underrepresentation that have kept Black women from interpreting the laws whose worst impacts we are most likely to face,\u201d wrote Fatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women\u2019s Law Center. Conservatives faulted Biden for his pledge: The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, \u201cMr. Biden\u2019s campaign promise that he\u2019d appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court is unfortunate because it elevates skin color over qualifications.\u201d But Ruth Marcus argued in the Washington Post that presidents have long applied similar thinking to their selection of Supreme Court justices: \u201cDoes Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor have an asterisk attached because Ronald Reagan pledged he would name a woman to the Supreme Court? \u2018It is time for a woman to sit among our highest jurists,\u2019 Reagan said during the 1980 presidential campaign. She turned out to be a fine justice, but her qualifications at the time were far less than those of the candidates on Biden\u2019s list.\u201d Jeffrey Toobin wrote that \u201cthe appointments of Supreme Court justices have always been political acts by presidents. And their choices have reflected the identity politics of their era. Far from striking out in some new direction, Biden has merely updated a tradition as old as the American presidency itself.\u201d Looking back at Breyer\u2019s career, Toobin described him as a man from another time. An Anglophile and devotee of Marcel Proust, Breyer is a technocrat who \u201cwas forever searching for the bipartisan solutions to society\u2019s problems. Breyer believed in compromise and competence. He thought reasonable people could always make progress if they worked together in good faith. It was Breyer\u2019s misfortune, though, to live in an ideological age. More to the point, he was mostly liberal on a mostly conservative court.\u201d Breyer was confirmed to the court in 1994, with 87 of the 100 senators backing him. We may not see such overwhelming bipartisanship again for a long time \u2013 each of Barack Obama\u2019s two confirmed appointees received no more than 68 votes, and Trump\u2019s appointees were confirmed with no more than 54. If Biden is unable to attract Republican votes for his nominee, he\u2019ll have to rely on the two Democrats who have defied him in recent months, Julian Zelizer noted. \u201cWith the midterms approaching, Senate Republicans are likely to oppose the nomination \u2013 whoever it is \u2013 and use it to rally the base. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his troops could warn that Biden\u2019s pick will threaten constitutional rights\u2026\u201d \u201cBiden should be able to ignore all of that \u2013 if he has the support of Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. But this raises the question of whether the President will face a repeat of the Build Back Better battle, with just two Democrats tanking the party\u2019s ability to move forward and allowing the Republican minority to rule the roost.\u201d Democrats should take a cue from the way Republicans handled the Barrett nomination, wrote Stephanie Cutter in the New York Times. \u201cWithin minutes of the president\u2019s nomination of Judge Barrett, Republican senators began to declare their support for her\u2026Qualifications are critical and must be verified. But speed is also essential. Democrats should take a page from Mr. McConnell\u2019s book and move as quickly as possible.\u201d For much of the world, the massing of Russian troops on Ukraine\u2019s border prompts an uneasy guessing game: what will President Vladimir Putin do \u2013 and when? But for Ukrainians it is much more personal. Writing from Kyiv, Olesia Markovic said, \u201cMany citizens choose to follow commonsense survival rules: stocking up on food and setting up meeting points with their loved ones in case communication is down\u2026The key facility designed to be a mass shelter in case of air strikes is the underground infrastructure of the Kyiv subway. Yet, its capacity is limited to \u2018hosting\u2019 about 200,000 people, which is not enough for Kyiv\u2019s population of at least 3 million.\u201d \u201cPeople admit the uncertainty and the lack of clear emergency instructions are draining their intellectual and emotional resources, making it hard to focus on current tasks and their ability to make long-term plans. Yet, denial would be even more harmful.\u201d On the timing of any potential Russian action, many people suspect Putin will not want to upstage the start of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The Russian President is due to attend the opening ceremony Friday with his fellow authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cTo cement their hold on power, autocrats love to stage mega-events, none better than the Olympics. They represent an opportunity to proclaim their success to their people and to the world; to make the unspoken argument that, whatever price they have extracted in repression, the ends have justified the means. For maximum impact, however, they need the world\u2019s rapt attention.\u201d Mark Twain described October as \u201cone of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.\u201d This January, the markets seem gripped with anxiety about the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s impending move to raise interest rates in an attempt to tame the worst inflation in nearly 40 years. But not all the economic news is dire \u2013 unemployment is low and the US economy grew 5.7% last year, the largest annual increase since 1984. Our friends at CNN Business Perspectives offered a variety of views on the economy this week, including Mark Zandi\u2019s take that \u201cthe economy has become prone to asset bubbles. There was the dot-com stock market bubble in 2000 and the housing bubble of the mid-2000s. When these bubbles ultimately deflated, they did significant damage to the economy. It is premature to think that we are in the next asset bubble, but it is not premature to worry that one is forming.\u201d Noted bear analyst Jeremy Grantham believes we\u2019re already in a stock market \u201csuperbubble,\u201d accompanied by a worldwide real estate bubble.

With her voice catching, Miranda confesses to feeling trapped in her marriage to Steve (David Eigenberg), telling Carrie, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be this person anymore, I want to be something more. This isn\u2019t enough.\u2019\u201d (Like CNN, HBO Max is owned by WarnerMedia.) In real life, as Bodenheimer noted, the divorce rate for couples over 50 has doubled in recent decades. \u201cSeeing more of my own peers get divorced in recent years has reinforced for me that although not free from pain, divorce can be a positive development, particularly for women who don\u2019t feel fulfilled in their partnerships. This is why, whenever I know a friend really wanted out of their marriage, I congratulate them on their divorce; I don\u2019t assume any announcement of divorce is necessarily a sad one.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Douglas Heye is the ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a GOP strategist and a CNN political commentator. Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. While former President Donald Trump continues to peddle lies about election fraud and attack fellow Republicans who refuse to go along with his conspiracy theories, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to point the GOP in a different direction. To keep this split within the GOP from becoming an unbridgeable chasm, McConnell has to tread carefully and avoid a destructive intraparty war with Trump that could thwart the GOP\u2019s chances at gaining control of Congress in 2022. Trump so far has endorsed several candidates who have parroted his lies about widespread voter fraud in 2020. McConnell, on the other hand, continues to coolly push back, telling CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Tuesday, \u201cIt\u2019s important for candidates to remember we need to respect the results of our democratic process unless the court system demonstrates that some significant fraud occurred that would change the outcome.\u201d For McConnell, this is not merely his theoretical take on democracy, but good politics. McConnell, who admitted the Senate GOP \u201cnominated some unelectable candidates\u201d in 2010, knows that peddling lies about election fraud is not the way to win \u2013 especially when President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of inflation, the withdrawal from Afghanistan and Covid-19 could be a boon for Republican candidates. Last year, during the Senate runoff elections in Georgia, Trump ended up putting the two incumbent Republicans, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, in a corner; they were forced to either echo his baseless claims of voter fraud or risk losing the support of his followers. The two chose to follow Trump \u2013 and lost, handing the Senate majority over to the Democrats. One word sums up Breyer's judicial philosophy It turns out that when the President of the United States tells people that their vote doesn\u2019t count, enough of them will believe the lies and decide not to vote, which can throw a Senate election or two in the other party\u2019s favor. And if there\u2019s anything that proves elections have consequences, it\u2019ll be the upcoming Senate vote to replace Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer \u2013 with the two Georgia Democrats helping to confirm a new liberal justice who could potentially sit on the Supreme Court bench for decades. This isn\u2019t the first time McConnell has seen Republicans tank their own races. In 2010, when the GOP gained 63 House seats and six Senate seats, the party made two unforced errors with the disastrous Senate campaigns in Delaware and Nevada. In Delaware, Republican candidate Christine O\u2019Donnell had to run a commercial denying she was a witch (after admitting to dabbling in witchcraft) while Sharron Angle, who was running in Nevada, was extremely press-shy. Indeed, as the Republican National Committee communications director at the time, I can attest to wasting time and resources dealing with these doomed campaigns. In 2012, the campaigns of both Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana tanked after they made inflammatory comments about rape and abortion, costing the GOP a further two seats. These candidates, all of whom found themselves mired in bizarre controversies, were seemingly unable and unwilling to try to appeal to a broader set of voters. The elephant in the room Biden can't ignore So while McConnell is on the same page as Trump on some candidates, such as Georgia\u2019s Herschel Walker, or staying neutral on others, he is mindful to avoid the mistakes of the past in order to secure a Republican Senate majority in 2022. And while Republicans are favored to make significant gains, McConnell is playing it safe, putting the GOP\u2019s chances to take back the Senate at \u201c50-50.\u201d With Trump promising more political rallies, we know we will hear more \u201cstop the steal\u201d rhetoric. For Trump followers, the lack of clear political goals (other than fundraising) and policy objectives may not matter. The rhetoric itself serves as cotton candy for a certain segment of the Republican base, with the airing of grievances over 2020 causing a temporary sugar high. But this strategy could be damaging to the Republican Party at large. Talk of a rigged election could cause Trump followers to stay home on Election Day. And it certainly doesn\u2019t help secure the votes of moderates and independents. A growing number of Americans disapprove of Biden, believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, and are consumed by issues such as inflation, supply chain disruptions, rising violent crime and border crossings. McConnell knows these are the issues that will drive voters to the polls \u2013 not something that happened, or, more accurately, did not happen \u2013 two years ago.  Focusing on these issues avoids depressing part of the GOP base or alienating independent voters who want to see candidates focus on the problems that affect their everyday lives. That may put McConnell at odds with Trump from time to time. But it\u2019s much firmer ground for Republican candidates who want to win in November. And McConnell knows that.",

She is the co-author of \u201cReimagining Global Abortion Politics.\u201d Pierson is co-chair of the Feminist Studies Association, a UK and Ireland-based network promoting feminist research and teaching, and board member of Alliance for Choice, a campaign group advocating for free and safe legal abortion. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. Roberta Metsola had double reason last Tuesday to celebrate \u2013 marking both her 43rd birthday and becoming the youngest ever president of the European Union\u2019s Parliament. She is also the first woman in 20 years to have the job. But at the first news conference following her victory, Metsola immediately faced questions around her stance on abortion rights. Metsola is a member of the center-right European People\u2019s party and is anti-abortion. She comes from Malta, which has the strictest abortion laws in Europe, criminalizing abortion under any circumstances. Malta is also the only EU member with a total ban. Indeed, Metsola voted against the 2021 EU Parliament Matic Resolution which declared abortion to be a human right, on the basis that Malta should have the right to legislate for itself on abortion. And in 2020, she voted against an EU resolution on Covid-19 which describes denial of abortion as a form of violence against women. In 2015 Metsola also signed a statement with other Maltese MEP\u2019s that stated they were \u201ccategorically against abortion.\u201d That said, Metsola was clear during her first news conference as president, that she would respect the Parliament\u2019s position on all matters, including abortion. \u201cMy position is that of the European Parliament,\u201d she said. \u201cThis parliament has always been clear and unambiguous on the issue of sexual and reproductive health rights.\u201d While over 95% of women of reproductive age in Europe live within liberal abortion regimes, the election of a president who is explicitly anti-abortion indicates that it is necessary to ensure abortion is clearly designated as a human rights issue, with decriminalization as a minimum standard. The current backlashes on gender equality in some EU member states mean that continued liberalization of abortion is not guaranteed throughout Europe, and a change in government can mean a regression in abortion access or laws. Some countries, like Poland, are attempting to roll back abortion provision. It should come as no shock that women leaders can be anti-feminist too The right to abortion is not guaranteed in Europe \u2013 states which oppose liberal abortion laws argue that they have national sovereignty over the issue, while those which support liberal laws argue that as a human right it is a supranational issue. While the majority of countries have laws allowing abortion on request or on broad social grounds, there continue to be barriers to accessing care, such as conscientious objection by health care providers, mandatory counselling and waiting periods, and gestational limits which mean some women and pregnant people continue to travel across borders to access care. The threat of sanctions can delay or prevent care. For example, doctors in Germany are banned from advertising abortion services or providing information online. Decriminalizing abortion would allow it to be governed like any other health procedure, helping to remove barriers to care, abortion travel and the associated stigma. The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic further highlighted inequality in abortion access across EU member states, and the need for a common public health response across the bloc. Abortion is an essential and often urgent health care requirement, but border closures and restrictions to movement made apparent the barriers to care women face. Countries such as Italy designated abortion as non-essential, therefore delaying care, while other nations like Poland sharply limited access to abortion. A culture war is raging in Poland. The battleground: Women's bodies Elsewhere, countries like France and Ireland used the pandemic as an opportunity to expand their telemedicine \u2013 or virtual care \u2013 allowing abortion seekers to access early medical abortion without having to travel to attend a clinic. While these measures were deemed as temporary necessities, their success indicates that in particular telemedicine for early medical abortion should become standard care. The EU is often described as a champion for gender equality, in particular on issues such as LGBTQ rights and gender-based violence. However, opposition to gender equality, including abortion, is growing in several states including Hungary and Poland through their government\u2019s nationalistic, populist discourse and political parties claiming to defend traditional family structures and gender roles. Research on the EU Parliament suggests that approximately 30% of current MEP\u2019s are anti-gender, viewing women\u2019s human rights as a threat to \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cfamily values.\u201d Metsola takes over the helm of a European Parliament at a critical moment in Europe\u2019s future, and can still play an important role in ensuring women\u2019s access to abortion. Indeed Europe\u2019s most recent resolution to focus on reproductive rights, the 2021 Matic resolution, was initiated by the Parliament who instructed the European Commission to introduce legislation on reproductive rights.  The resolution frames abortion as a human rights issue and specifically condemns Poland and Malta for their restrictive abortion laws. While the resolution was subject to a large number of amendments, and Metsola voted against it, the final text that was passed in 2021 urges decriminalization of abortion in member states and the removal of any obstacles to abortion. If Metsola is to stand by her claim of respecting the Parliament\u2019s position on abortion then she must put forward decriminalization of abortion \u2013 even in her home state of Malta.",

            "article_content": "Denver has formally apologized to early Chinese immigrants and their descendants for its role in an 1880 riot that destroyed the city\u2019s Chinatown. In an ceremony on April 16, Mayor Michael B. Hancock presented an apology letter to families whose ancestors had been targeted by xenophobia and mob violence in Denver more than a century ago. \u201cTo heal, we must be willing to face and address themes we have avoided, apologize for wrongs we have committed and follow through with the actions that are true to ongoing positive change,\u201d he said at the event. The first Chinese immigrants reportedly arrived in Denver in the late 1860s, relegated to enclaves where they faced poor living conditions, as historian William Wei detailed in his book \u201cAsians in Colorado: A History of Persecution and Perseverance in the Centennial State.\u201d Over the next decade, many Chinese opened their own laundry businesses, and the area where they lived and worked became a thriving commercial district. Chinese immigrants were targeted in 19th century America As Denver\u2019s Chinatown prospered, many of the city\u2019s White and European residents came to resent Chinese immigrants and scapegoated them for an array of issues. On October 30, 1880, political organizers held an anti-Chinese parade in advance of the presidential election, as CNN reported last year. The next day, a fight broke out at a bar and morphed into a mob that would end in the lynching of a Chinese man. Numerous other Chinese residents were attacked and beaten, and properties in the neighborhood were decimated. RELATED: Burned from the land: How 60 years of racial violence shaped America Survivors were never compensated for the estimated tens of thousands of dollars they were believed to have lost, according to History Colorado. Today, there\u2019s hardly a trace of the vibrant Chinatown that once was. The city of Denver said in its apology letter that its police force failed to keep Chinese residents safe leading up to and during the violence, and that it failed to hold the perpetrators in the lynching of a Chinese man accountable. In later years, the apology states, Denver aggressively harassed Chinese residents and raided their communities while enforcing the federal government\u2019s Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Denver is the fifth city in the US known to have formally apologized for its history of anti-Asian discrimination and violence, and the first outside California to do so. The 1880 riot was one of several such instances in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that targeted Asians in the West, and since last year, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose and Antioch have also apologized for past racism and discrimination against Chinese immigrants. Advocates for Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in Denver said the apology was an important step. \u201cThis is a start for a movement where we really start to recognize and honor the legacies of our communities,\u201d Joie Ha, who serves as vice-chair of the Colorado Asian Pacific United, told CNN affiliate KCNC-TV. Colorado Asian Pacific United helped lead the April 16 apology event. Denver also said in its apology letter that it was \u201ccommitted to supporting the establishment of an Asian Pacific Historic District, sponsoring the painting of public murals depicting the history and culture of Asian Pacific Coloradans, partnering on the development of a public education program about Asian Pacific Coloradans, and founding an Asian Pacific American community museum.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tami Luhby, Breeanna Hare, Channon Hodge contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Justice Department is ending its three-year-old China Initiative, a national security program intended to thwart China\u2019s intelligence activities in the US, including those aimed at stealing emerging technology from research universities, in the wake of a string of dismissals of cases and complaints that it fueled suspicion and bias against innocent Chinese Americans. Matthew Olsen, assistant attorney general for national security, announced the change of strategy Wednesday, following a months-long review of the initiative and his conclusion that there was merit to some of the criticism from Asian Americans and from universities that the program was not only fueling discrimination but was also harming efforts to attract top talent and to pursue cutting edge research. \u201cAnything that creates the impression that the Department of Justice applies different standards based on race or ethnicity harms the department and our efforts, and it harms the public,\u201d Olsen told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI do believe that the China Initiative was driven by genuine national security concerns. But I\u2019m also mindful that the department must maintain the trust of the people whom we serve.\u201d Olsen, in a speech at George Mason University\u2019s National Security Institute, announced that the department would pursue a broader strategy to counter not only threats from China but also from Russia, Iran and North Korea. It\u2019s a nuanced change, Olsen told reporters, noting that he agreed with comments recently from FBI Director Christopher Wray, who said that the Chinese government\u2019s activity have become \u201cmore brazen, more damaging than ever before.\u201d The China Initiative was launched in 2018 under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who early on had decided the intelligence, cyber and repressive threat that China posed to be worse than the Russian threat then dominating the headlines amid the investigation at the time of Russian election interference to aid Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The Justice Department has credited the initiative with some major prosecution victories, including against Chinese spies working to steal US technology. The department\u2019s website lists nearly 60 cases under the initiative ranging from hacking to spying to false statements in grant applications. But the initiative also ran into major problems in court, particularly in cases targeting what prosecutors said was grant fraud by university researchers who the government said failed to disclose ties to China. Last summer, the department was forced to drop charges against a half dozen people who faced charges related to their research grants and what the department said was an attempt to hide ties to China. In Tennessee, a judge dismissed a case against a Chinese Canadian researcher after a jury deadlocked on what prosecutors said was an attempt to defraud the US government. Olsen, in his speech Wednesday, said his national security prosecutors would more closely supervise cases involving grant fraud, which was the source of many of the complaints about the China initiative. In some cases, instead of criminal prosecution, he said, the department might seek civil or administrative sanctions. Asian Americans Advancing Justice, an Asian American civil rights group, called the end of the China initiative \u201can important step towards ending the cyclical and historic racial profiling of Asian Americans and immigrants.\u201d And Zhengyu Huang, president of Committee of 100, a group of prominent Chinese Americans, said in a statement: \u201cThe China Initiative is a failed program that has fueled racial animosity, xenophobia, and suspicion towards the AAPI community and Chinese Americans in particular.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step forward, but much more work needs to be done to ensure that all cases being prosecuted are based solely on evidence and not on perception.\u201d Olsen also highlighted recent Justice Department charges to show how prosecutors would redirect their efforts to broader threats. He noted charges against government officials from Belarus for using a false bomb threat to divert a passenger aircraft in order to arrest a prominent dissident, and charges against Iranian intelligence agents for plotting to kidnap a US-based journalist and human rights activist. Olsen took pains to say that while he is ending the China Initiative, he doesn\u2019t believe prosecutors and agents were acting with bias in cases that have run into trouble. But ending the initiative may not be embraced by some national security hawks, who believe the Biden administration has eased off the focus on threats from China. Wray, in his January speech, appeared to stake out a prebuttal position against any effort to soften the focus on China. \u201cThere is no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, our innovation and our economic security than China,\u201d Wray said, speaking at the Ronald Reagan Library. The FBI echoed Wray\u2019s comments in a statement later on Wednesday saying, \u201cNo government poses a broader, more severe threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than the government of China does,\u201d and vowing that it \u201cwill remain relentless countering the Chinese government in the long fight already underway. \u201c This story has been updated with additional details Wednesday.",
