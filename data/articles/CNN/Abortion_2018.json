            "article_content": "The Ohio House of Representatives is considering a bill that criminalizes abortion, redefines the state\u2019s definition of \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201cany unborn human\u201d and leaves the door open for extreme penalties for women and abortion providers. The law would effectively ban abortions in Ohio and means that women who get them \u2013 and the doctors who perform the procedure \u2013 could be charged with murder and potentially face the death penalty. In its current form, House Bill 565 makes no mention of exceptions for life-threatening pregnancies, or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. READ MORE: Facts about abortion in the United States The bill is sponsored by Republican Reps. Ron Hood and A. Nino Vitale, and co-sponsored by a group of 16 other Republican lawmakers that include 14 men and 2 women. \u201cI believe life begins at conception so the goal of this bill is to, first of all, continue to get the word out that life does begin at conception and move the debate in that direction and to protect unborn Ohioans from being aborted,\u201d Hood said when the bill was introduced. The bill is just the latest strict abortion legislation to come out of Ohio. Earlier this month, the state\u2019s House passed HB 258, known as the \u201cheartbeat bill,\u201d which would ban all abortions when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. This can occur as early as six weeks, possibly even before a woman knows she is pregnant. OPINION: Why the heartbeat law should worry you The heartbeat bill has sparked pushback. Governor John Kasich has vowed to veto the bill if it reaches his desk, as he did with a similar bill in 2016. NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, the state chapter of a national abortion-rights organization, called the heartbeat bill \u201chorrific\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d \u201cAnti-abortion ideologues should not attempt to insert politics between a patient and their physician,\u201d NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio Executive Director Kellie Copeland said in a statement regarding HB 258. HB 565 was first introduced in March, but has come back to public attention due several converging events: The midterm election, the appointment of conservative Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and the passage of the heartbeat bill. NARAL\u2019s Copeland told CNN she hasn\u2019t seen a big push to move HB 565 forward. But it\u2019s still a point of major concern for her group. \u201cThis bill is disturbing because it has been co-sponsored by a lot of legislators, and would equate abortion with murder in Ohio,\u201d she told CNN. Copeland says more abortion opponents are voicing support for punishing not just physicians for giving abortions, as they would be under HB 258, but women for getting them. \u201cThis tells you what our opponents ultimately would like to see. They wrote this because they and others would like to see this, in Ohio and in the country.\u201d she said. \u201cIt was also written to be a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, and now that conservatives have a majority on the Supreme Court, we can\u2019t know for sure that they would protect that ruling.\u201d The renewed attention over Ohio\u2019s HB 565 comes the same week a Mississippi judge struck down an extreme abortion law. Last spring Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed the Gestational Age Act into law, which would have banned any abortions after 15 weeks. But a federal judge just blocked the law, saying it defies Supreme Court precedents and \u201cunequivocally\u201d infringes upon a woman\u2019s constitutional rights.",

            "article_content": " This won\u2019t be over by Easter. President Trump has officially extended social distancing guidelines until April 30. Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) So, what did we learn about ourselves as a country after these more-contentious-than-normal midterms? We\u2019re still divided. And that\u2019s reflected in the opposite trends in the House and Senate results. CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson explains that the political and cultural gulf between diverse and affluent liberals in big cities and suburbs\u00a0and mostly\u00a0white, working-class voters in rural areas has never seemed wider. The election was most definitely a referendum on President Trump. Nearly 4 out of 10 voters said their vote was a sign of opposition to him. But you can\u2019t deny, by virtue of that strong GOP showing in the Senate, that Trump\u2019s allure endures for a big swath of the country. As for the much-talked-about blue wave, it gave\u00a0Democrats something big \u2013 the House \u2013 but didn\u2019t quite deliver the cathartic punch they\u2019d been craving since 2016. Here are\u00a0more takeaways from the 2018 midterms, and you can get the latest updates and results on all the races right here. As expected, the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives. CNN projects the Dems will gain as many as 35 seats in the chamber. It\u2019s a huge victory for the party, which was shut out of power after President Trump\u2019s big win two years ago. And it\u2019s an even bigger setback for the President, who will no doubt have to contend with a dizzying array of investigations brought by the newly empowered Democrats. The Republicans not only kept the Senate, but they increased their majority. They knocked off two vulnerable red state Democrats in North Dakota and Indiana and fought off Democratic challenges in Texas and Tennessee. The GOP has the President\u00a0to thank for this. Trump crisscrossed the country campaigning for Republican Senate candidates, even if it meant losing the House. Keeping the Senate means the GOP can continue confirming the conservative judges that Trump has been nominating. Democrats made some gains in governors\u2019 mansions, but what they\u2019ll remember most about 2018 are the races that got away. Yes, the Dems gained six seats in governor\u2019s races, including impressive pickups in Kansas and Wisconsin. But the losses by\u00a0Andrew Gillum in Florida and Richard Cordray in Ohio will surely sting for some time. Democrat Stacey Abrams refused to concede her high-profile race to Republican Brian Kemp in Georgia. He\u2019s ahead in votes with 99% of precincts reporting, but she wants to wait for the absentee ballots to be counted before giving up the fight. So much history has been made! Let\u2019s start with the\u00a0record number of women \u2013 at least 96 \u2013 projected to win seats in the House. The historic total\u00a0caps off a campaign season in the wake of President Trump\u2019s election that was defined in large part by female activism. But that\u2019s not all: \u2013\u00a0Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar will be the first\u00a0Muslim women in Congress. \u2013\u00a0Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland will become the first Native American women elected to Congress. \u2013 Marsha Blackburn\u00a0will be the first female senator to represent Tennessee. \u2013 Jared Polis of Colorado will become the nation\u2019s\u00a0first openly gay man elected governor. \u2013 Kristi Noem will become the first female governor in South Dakota. \u2013 Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia will be the first Hispanic women from Texas elected to Congress. \u2013 Arizona will have its first female senator, but as of this morning, we still don\u2019t know if it will be\u00a0Republican Martha McSally or Democrat\u00a0Kyrsten Sinema. Voters didn\u2019t just choose candidates. They also voted on\u00a0ballot measures that hit on the hot-button topics of the day. Abortion: Voters in Alabama and West Virginia OK\u2019d changes to their state constitutions to further restrict abortions. Election policies: Florida voted to restore\u00a0voting rights for felons after they complete their sentences. Marijuana: Michigan voters OK\u2019d letting people over 21 use marijuana. Crime: Florida,\u00a0Georgia,\u00a0Kentucky,\u00a0Nevada,\u00a0North Carolina\u00a0and\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0all approved a version of \u201cMarsy\u2019s Law,\u201d\u00a0which adds specific protections for victims of crime to a state\u2019s constitution. Minimum wage: Voters in Arkansas and Missouri voted to hike the minimum wage to $11 and $12, respectively.

Children released Seventy-eight schoolchildren kidnapped by armed men in Cameroon have\u00a0been released. But their principal and a teacher are still held captive. Not talking A high-level meeting between the US and North Korea set for Friday has been postponed. It\u2019s a setback in talks between the two countries. Guilty verdict A jury in New York found Akayed Ullah guilty in the December 2017 attack on an underground walkway in the city\u2019s subway system.

            "article_content": "New York GOP Rep. Chris Collins is the latest politician to be tapped on the shoulder by the long arm of the law, and this time it\u2019s for \u2026 drumroll \u2026 insider trading. Federal prosecutors yesterday charged Collins, his son and another man with 13 counts of securities fraud, wire fraud and false statements stemming from an alleged insider trading scheme centered on an Australian pharmaceutical company. Collins has called the charges \u201cmeritless\u201d and says he will not step down. It\u2019s still not clear what the political fallout will be, although with the midterms just months away, things could get ugly. The National Republican Congressional Committee has already distanced itself from Collins, calling the charges \u201cserious.\u201d Depending on how things go, the indictment could mean Collins\u2019 comfy seat could be up for grabs come November. Over the last week, a comment Canada made about Saudi Arabia has blown up into a full diplomatic feud. It started last Friday, when the Canadian Foreign Ministry expressed concern over the arrest of some Saudi activists. The Saudi government responded by expelling the Canadian ambassador from Riyadh and recalling the Saudi envoy to Ottawa, suspending Saudi state airline flights to Toronto, and ending thousands of Saudi scholarship programs in Canada. Then on Tuesday, Saudi authorities announced they would halt all medical treatment programs in Canada and transfer Saudi patients to hospitals outside the country. Overkill? Possibly. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Canada \u201cmade a mistake and needs to fix it.\u201d We\u2019re still feeling some rumblings from Tuesday\u2019s primaries. That special election in Ohio that was too close to call? Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor, who trails the GOP\u2019s Troy Balderson by fewer than 2,000 votes, is refusing to concede. Missouri voters made a big statement by apparently ousting the St. Louis County prosecutor who didn\u2019t charge the officer responsible for the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown. His replacement? A Ferguson councilman. In other parts of the country, women were dropping firsts all over the place. Ex-MMA fighter Sharice Davids won the Democratic nomination for a House seat in Kansas and could become the first openly gay Native American woman in Congress. And in Michigan, Rashida Tlaib clinched a Democratic congressional nom and will likely run unopposed in November. That means she\u2019ll probably be the first Muslim woman elected to Congress. Argentina\u2019s Senate has voted against a bill legalizing elective abortion. The proposed law was the subject of fiery debate in the mostly Catholic homeland of Pope Francis, and protesters and abortion rights activists had taken to the streets ahead of the decision. The bill had narrowly passed the lower house of Congress in June; the Senate voted it down, 38 to 31, early this morning. The bill would have expanded abortion rights to allow women to end a pregnancy in the first 14 weeks. Laws now allow the procedure only in cases of rape or when the mother\u2019s health is at risk. The frontrunner in Brazil\u2019s upcoming presidential election was stabbed during a rally. Video shows\u00a0shows Jair Bolsonaro being led through a crowd of supporters when a man suddenly stabs him in the chest. The suspect, who has a Facebook page full of anti-Bolsonaro posts, was arrested. Bolsonaro is recovering at a hospital after surgery and likely will be off the campaign trail for weeks. Bolsonaro\u2019s known for making\u00a0racist, sexist and homophobic remarks, but he\u2019s attracted millions\u00a0of supporters who believe he can shake up Brazil\u2019s corruption-marred political class. The election is set for October 7. A scourge of superbugs is killing Malawi\u2019s babies, and doctors are rushing to find a solution. A combination of poverty, unhygienic conditions, a lack of clean water and supplies, and substandard hospital environments means babies are especially at risk for deadly infections. In the last few years, doctors have seen more and more infections, like some strains of E. coli, that are resistant to typical antibiotics like penicillin. Antibiotic resistance is a real problem, and not just in places like Malawi where other factors contribute to crises. The CDC estimates 23,000 Americans die every year from antibiotic-resistant infections. \u201cVictims in New York deserve to be heard as well \u2013 and we are going to do everything in our power to bring them the\u00a0justice they deserve.\u201d Here\u2019s how they train service dogs like George H.W.

It\u2019s the only question that matters this morning, as Washington tries to solve a stunning political mystery:\u00a0Who is the \u201csenior official\u201d in the Trump administration who\u00a0wrote an\u00a0anonymous New York Times editorial that slams Donald Trump\u2019s \u201camorality\u201d and decision-making and claims to be part of an internal \u201cresistance\u201d force dedicated to thwarting his worst impulses? The bombshell op-ed, landing the same week as excerpts from Bob Woodward\u2019s new book, has reportedly heightened the already sky-high level of paranoia at the White House. The President was downright giddy at the prospect of not only making his second Supreme Court pick in less than two years\u00a0but also at the dream scenario it presents for him and the GOP: installing a consistently conservative court that can influence American law, life and culture for generations. It\u2019s the main reason so many Republicans voted for Trump in 2016. Democrats, already beaten down by days of SCOTUS rulings, were absolutely deflated. Some hoped to shame Republicans with cries of hypocrisy after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said hearings for Kennedy\u2019s replacement would be held this fall. They reminded anyone who would listen that the GOP blocked Barack Obama\u2019s high court nominee\u00a0from a hearing in 2016. But CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza says Senate Dems are powerless to stop Trump\u2019s pick.\u00a0And who will that be? Probably someone off the list of potential picks that Trump put out during the campaign and updated last year. Defense Secretary James Mattis made a surprise trip to Afghanistan today. He\u2019ll meet with\u00a0Army Gen. Scott Miller, the new Commander of Resolute Support and US Forces-Afghanistan. Mattis\u2019 visit comes as the US is trying to pump new energy into its Afghanistan strategy after 17 years of war. Just a few days ago, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0named veteran diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad as a special envoy to Afghanistan.\u00a0Khalilzad will focus on getting \u201cthe Afghans and the Taliban to come to a reconciliation.\u201d After his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un earlier this month, President Trump declared that the North Korean nuclear threat was over. Well, not so fast. New satellite images show the North has made improvements to a facility used to produce\u00a0weapons-grade fissile material. Infrastructure upgrades at the\u00a0Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center include modifications to the site\u2019s plutonium production reactor and construction of several support facilities. North Korea\u00a0says it \u201ccannot confirm the report,\u201d but one observer says this is \u201cstill an active site producing plutonium for\u201d the country. A ship stranded at sea for days \u2013 and loaded with 233 migrants \u2013 finally docked in Malta. The search and rescue ship, which belongs to German charity Mission Lifeline, was stuck in the Mediterranean for five days while European leaders bickered over the migrants\u2019 fate. A deal to let the ship dock in Malta was reached Tuesday. Malta, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland and France have all said they\u2019ll take in the migrants. How to deal with migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Mideast has become a hot-button issue in Europe, with some nations tightening their borders. Disney is\u00a0one huge step closer to buying most of 21st Century Fox. The Justice Department OK\u2019d a settlement with Disney that would let it purchase most of Fox\u2019s assets for $71.3 billion\u00a0(though Disney would have to sell off 22 of Fox\u2019s regional sports networks). But this mega deal isn\u2019t done yet. A federal judge still has to sign off, and Fox\u2019s shareholders have to vote on it. So,\u00a0where does this leave Comcast, which made its own $65 billion bid for\u00a0Fox? We\u2019re not sure; Comcast hasn\u2019t said yet.\u00a021st Century Fox is the next big prize as the media industry consolidates to survive against competitors like\u00a0Netflix and Facebook.

An official from the North\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the regime is still willing to meet with the US \u201cat any time.\u201d But that same official said Trump\u2019s decision isn\u2019t \u201cconsistent with the desire of humankind for peace and stability in the world.\u201d The summit\u2019s demise \u2013 after a North Korean official raised the specter of a nuclear showdown and called US VP Mike Pence a \u201cpolitical dummy\u201d \u2013 also puts South Korea, China and Japan under a new cloud of uncertainty.

The bombshell op-ed, landing the same week as excerpts from Bob Woodward\u2019s new book, has reportedly heightened the already sky-high level of paranoia at the White House. Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein will turn himself in to New York police this morning on rape charges, a source tells CNN. Prosecutors are expected to charge him with first- and third-degree rape in one case and first-degree sex act in a second case. Weinstein is also under investigation for alleged sex crimes in Los Angeles and London, and he\u2019s reportedly the subject of a probe by federal prosecutors in New York. The charges follow a flood of accusations against Weinsten that led women around the world to come forward with accounts of being sexually harassed by powerful men. Meanwhile, eight women have accused Hollywood legend Morgan Freeman of inappropriate behavior or harassment on movie sets, at his company and in interviews. The women, in the exclusive CNN report, made allegations of unwanted touching, demeaning comments and inappropriate staring. Freeman released a statement in which he apologized, saying it \u201cwas never my intent\u201d to make people feel \u201cuncomfortable or disrespected.\u201d Fifteen people were hurt last night in Mississauga, Ontario, after two men walked into an Indian restaurant there and set off an \u201cimprovised explosive device,\u201d police said. The men fled after the explosion; surveillance photos show them wearing jeans and dark-colored hoodies, with one covering his face with a black cloth. Of those hurt, three people suffered critical injuries and were taken to a trauma center in Toronto. No word yet on a motive. Investigators are working to try to find a motive in a shooting in Cincinnati\u2019s Fountain Square district that killed at least three people. Police say a man, armed with a pistol and more than 200 rounds of ammo, opened fire on the loading dock of a bank headquarters building before going to the lobby. There, he was shot and killed by police. \u201cThis could have been a bloodbath beyond imagination,\u201d a prosecutor said. The shooter, 29-year-old\u00a0Omar Enrique Santa Perez, had no known connections to the building, police said. Is Julian Assange\u2019s stay at Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London almost over? Sources tell CNN that Assange\u2019s situation is \u201cunusually bad\u201d and that he could leave \u201cany day now\u201d \u2013 either because he\u2019ll be forced out or made to feel so restricted he\u2019ll leave. Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been holed up in the embassy for almost six years. He was originally wanted for questioning in Sweden on a rape charge (prosecutors dropped that investigation last year). But he\u2019s still afraid to leave the protection of the embassy because the US has prepared charges to seek his arrest. US intel agencies think Russia used him as an intermediary to distribute hacked Hillary Clinton campaign emails during the 2016 presidential election.

Bolsonaro\u2019s known for making\u00a0racist, sexist and homophobic remarks, but he\u2019s attracted millions\u00a0of supporters who believe he can shake up Brazil\u2019s corruption-marred political class.

            "article_content": "Procter & Gamble never marched on Washington singing \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d Google was never blocked from eating in a diner that said, \u201cFor People Only.\u201d Nobody ever called the Pillsbury Doughboy the N-word. When people talk about the oppressed, they usually refer to groups like racial minorities or gays and lesbians. But a new book shows how corporations successfully staged their own freedom movement by employing tactics associated with civil rights struggles: civil disobedience, test court cases and portraying themselves as victims of political persecution. In \u201cWe The Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights,\u201d UCLA law professor Adam Winkler details how corporations waged a two century-long campaign to win nearly the same rights as ordinary people: freedom of speech, religious liberty and \u201cpersonhood\u201d \u2013 the notion former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney alluded to when he said, \u201cCorporations are people, my friend.\u201d We think of the Supreme Court as a bulwark to protect minorities, but it\u2019s used that power much more often to protect the rich and powerful Adam Winkler, author of \"We The Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights\" Romney\u2019s declaration was part of the rationale that produced Citizens United, a 2010 Supreme Court decision that eased restrictions on spending by corporations and unions in political campaigns. That decision was widely criticized, but questions over corporate power in politics persist. Facebook has been accused of swaying a presidential election. A recent overhaul of the nation\u2019s tax code has been depicted as a corporate giveaway.  In another victory for corporations, the Supreme Court said this week that companies could block workers from banding together to fight legal disputes in employment arbitration agreements. Some even say the US is no longer a democracy but a \u201ccorporatocracy.\u201d Supreme Court sides with employers in class action arbitration cases In an accessible and engaging read, Winkler shows how corporations took their cries for freedom, not to the streets but to the Supreme Court to become \u201cthe most powerful players in American politics.\u201d They successfully argued that their equal rights were being violated by unwanted regulations and taxes. And they engaged in civil disobedience by refusing to pay what they considered unlawful taxes, deliberately breaking the law to send test cases to court. \u201cWe think of the Supreme Court as a bulwark to protect minorities,\u201d Winkler says, \u201cbut it\u2019s used that power much more often to protect the rich and powerful.\u201d In one of the most astonishing sections in the book, Winkler recounts how the corporations and the court transformed the 14th Amendment \u2013 designed to protect the basic rights of freed slaves after the Civil War \u2013  into a weapon to boost corporate power. He writes: \u201cThe 14th Amendment was converted from a shield for the rights of racial minorities \u2013 who found little protection from the Supreme Court for the next half-century \u2013 into a weapon for corporations to use against state laws regulating business activity.\u201d Winkler recently sat down with CNN to talk about the book. This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity: Q: A lot of people complain about the growing power of corporate money in politics, particularly after the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision. You say that it\u2019s difficult for courts to control the power of corporations in politics. Why is that? A: We think of the courts as being a place of equal justice, of Lady Justice being blind to the relative finances of the parties. But the court system is also uniquely designed for those with money to take advantage. And corporations, unlike civil rights organizations, have had the resources to hire the best, most creative and most experienced lawyers in the country to represent their interests in court. Corporations have the resources and the willingness to think of litigation as just the cost of doing business. They fight over and over again to challenge nearly any law in court that regulates their activities in ways they don\u2019t like. It takes money to bring lawsuits, and they have the money to bring the lawsuits. Q: How did the 14th Amendment become this weapon to benefit the powerful? A: It\u2019s one of the most remarkable turnarounds in constitutional law. Corporations have been able to turn progressive reforms into reforms that help business and capital. The perfect example is the 14th Amendment, adopted after the Civil War to protect the rights of the newly freed slaves. But the Southern Pacific Railroad company 15 years later went to the Supreme Court and said this provision protects corporations, too. And eventually the Supreme Court would agree. In 1913, there was a study of Supreme Court cases under the 14th Amendment, and it discovered that the Supreme Court had, over the past half a century, heard 28 14th Amendment  cases on the rights of African-Americans \u2013 most of them ruling against African-Americans. And at the same time the court heard 312 cases on the right of business corporations, with corporations winning many of those cases. The 14th  Amendment was adopted for the dispossessed and the outcast. But it was used more vigorously and successfully by the forces of capital. Q: Why was the court so deferential to corporate power and less vigorous enforcing the rights of African-Americans? A: Part of the reason is that we misunderstand the Supreme Court. We think of it in terms of left vs. right \u2013 are they conservative or liberal. But what\u2019s united the justices over the course of American history is that they\u2019ve generally been pro-business, whether they are liberal or conservative. I think that reflects our political process, the influence that corporations have in getting their presidents elected and presidents who support business. And let\u2019s face it, in a capitalist system businesses will always be powerful and influential because they bring the material wealth that everyone depends on. That\u2019s why we see cities throwing money and tax breaks at corporations to come move there even when the economic benefits are not really crystal clear. So corporations are by necessity pretty powerful. Q: What are the potential consequences in America if corporate power continues to grow unchecked? A: We have such a complicated relationship with corporate politics. We criticize corporations for spending money on elections in the wake of Citizens United. At the same time, we celebrate Dick\u2019s  Sporting Goods when they announce they\u2019re not going to sell guns to people under the age of 21.  Or we complement a private company that says we won\u2019t do business with North Carolina because they\u2019re discriminating against transgender people. We have a complicated relationship with business and politics. On the one hand, we don\u2019t want business to take over our politics. On the other hand, we as consumers often recognize that business can sometimes be more responsive to our demands than elected officials are; especially in this era of partisan gerrymandering when we don\u2019t have much influence over who gets elected to office, we do have some choice about what we can do with our spending dollars. Q: Is it na\u00efve, though, to expect corporations to be a consistent force for social good? You talk in the book about corporations\u2019 primary duty, which is to their shareholders. A: I think it\u2019s true that corporations can be a vehicle for public good, but it\u2019ll only happen when that public good corresponds with the business interests of that corporation. And so that\u2019s the warning sign you have to watch out for. The same corporate power that can lead a state to say we\u2019re not going to pass a transgender bathroom bill because we\u2019re afraid of corporate boycotts can lead to a Trump tax bill, which provides massive tax breaks to corporations and hurts ordinary individuals. It\u2019s a real problem. Corporations get involved in politics and assert constitutional rights not because they\u2019re seeking dignity and the kind of freedom we\u2019re looking for. They\u2019re doing it so that they can pursue profit. And profit only. We have to remember when corporations are empowered that they are always going to be directed by that profit motive. Q: You talk about a time when the courts were more suspicious of corporate power in politics. What\u2019s the difference between that time and today? What was happening? A: There was a huge scandal between 1905 and 1907. It was known as The Great Wall Street Scandal. It showed that Teddy Roosevelt, who had created this public image as a trust buster who was going against corporations, was really in the pocket of big business. He had won an election in 1904 with a vast majority of financing coming from corporations. This led to a huge scandal. There were investigations into how corporations were getting involved in politics. People asked, how could we stop corporations from exerting this kind of power. And we saw the rise of campaign finance laws in response to this scandal. So there was the attitude that people recognized that corporations were important, but that they were important for business and making money. But they didn\u2019t have the same rights of personal liberty and personal conscience that people have. It\u2019s a lesson that today\u2019s Supreme Court has seemed to have forgotten. Q: You make an interesting point near the end of the book when you talk about the Supreme Court\u2019s 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision and the principle of equality that is basic in law. A: One reason why campaign finance laws keep getting struck down by the Supreme Court is because it says there is no legitimate government interest to promote equality in the political process. This is a very odd statement about politics. Equality is such an important principle in American politics. Everyone gets one vote. You don\u2019t get two votes. It\u2019s not like corporate America where shareholders can get as many votes as they can get shares for. Even the contest of speech around elections, we have a principle of equality. If we have a debate we have two candidates \u2013 they get equal time to argue their positions. For a long time we even had equal time rules for the big three broadcasters. Even in oral arguments in the Supreme Court, each side gets equal time. Q: If corporate power keeps expanding, where does America end up? I hear people already saying we\u2019re not a democracy but a corporatocracy. Is that hyperbole? A: I can\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s complicated. Corporations don\u2019t rule everything. But they rule in a lot of things. Political scientists often show that in issues of high public salience, like abortion or gun rights, those are issues that are not going to be affected that much by big business because people\u2019s views on those are really locked in personally. But where corporations are most powerful are on regulatory issues and environmental laws, little things that people aren\u2019t paying attention to. In those issues, like the [Trump] tax bill, corporations do really well. I do think we are moving into a world where corporations are gaining more power, and gaining more rights that are troublesome: rights of political speech, rights of religious liberty to give them exemption from generally applicable laws. At the same time, we are seeing people trying to use corporations to do good. Ultimately, if we are going to make our society a better and more just society, we\u2019re not going to end up getting rid of corporations. We have to make corporations serve us better.",

            "article_content": "On Friday, a federal judge in Texas added the latest chapter to the nearly decade-long legal and political fight over the Affordable Care Act by ruling that the individual mandate, which forced everyone to have some sort of health insurance, was unconstitutional \u2013 and predicting that the entire law would fail. But in a twist, the judge didn\u2019t throw the law out. In fact, the ACA \u2013 colloquially known as Obamacare \u2013 remains the law of the land today as it awaits certain appeal in higher courts. In an attempt to sort through all of this chaos and confusion, I reached out to CNN\u2019s health care guru, Tami Luhby, for answers. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Cillizza: The ruling out of Texas is very complicated and confusing. How does it affect the average person right now? Luhby: Right now, nothing changes. While the judge declared the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, he did not issue an injunction to stop federal or state officials from enforcing it. The Department of Health & Human Services said Monday it will \u201ccontinue administering and enforcing all aspects of the ACA as it had before the court issued its decision. This decision does not require that HHS make any changes to any of the ACA programs it administers or its enforcement of any portion of the ACA at this time.\u201d That means the more than 10 million people who have coverage on the exchanges this year \u2013 as well as the millions who signed up for policies for 2019 \u2013 will not be affected. Same goes for the millions of low-income Americans who are benefiting from Medicaid expansion. But it\u2019s important to remember that the Affordable Care Act affects nearly everyone, not just those in the individual market or on Medicaid. All the protections for those with pre-existing conditions remain in place, as do the provisions that provide folks with free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. Americans, including those on Medicare, will still be able to get a free preventive care. And children under age 26 will be able to stay on their parents\u2019 plan. Cillizza: What, if anything, can House Democrats do to counter this ruling when they take over the majority in 2019? Luhby: The Democrats have already promised to pass legislation to cement the law\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, who will chair the Ways and Means Committee, has said this will be among his top priorities come January. They may also float bills to protect other popular parts of the law. Why Trump can't count on the Supreme Court to kill Obamacare But much of the Democrats\u2019 focus in the past year is to go beyond the Affordable Care Act. In both the House and Senate, they have been focusing their energy on promoting more government involvement in health insurance. Progressive House lawmakers, including Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Washington), Mark Pocan (Wisconsin) and Ro Khanna (California), are leading a growing \u201cMedicare for All\u201d caucus, a counterpart to the Medicare for All push in the Senate, led by Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders, an independent. Then, there\u2019s a group who want to go halfway, allowing some Americans to buy into Medicare. There are a handful of these plans floating in the Senate and from think tanks. In the House, Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to reclaim the speakership in January, has promised to support New York Rep. Brian Higgins\u2019 plan to allow those 50 and older to buy into the popular program for senior citizens. Of course, the Democrats can\u2019t actually save Obamacare without support from Senate Republicans \u2013 who have backed the lawsuit even as some said they support a number of the protections it attacked \u2013 and President Donald Trump, who hailed the ruling as an opportunity to start over on health care. However, the popularity of certain provisions \u2013 particularly those that ban insurers from denying coverage or basing premiums on people\u2019s health histories \u2013 will put pressure on Republicans to keep their campaign promises to defend at least parts of the law. Cillizza: Let\u2019s say the ACA is ended. What sort of legislation do Republicans have waiting in the wings to fill that health care vacuum? Luhby: Not much. The Republicans largely moved on from Obamacare after their spectacular failure to slay it last year. They simply couldn\u2019t muster enough agreement \u2013 and votes \u2013 to repeal and replace it. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, along with nine other Republican senators, floated legislation this summer billed as guaranteeing \u201cAmericans have equal health care coverage, regardless of their health status or pre-existing conditions.\u201d It would prohibit insurers in the individual market from basing premiums on health, but it would allow them to exclude coverage of treatments for those pre-existing conditions. The bill was quickly panned by Democrats and health care experts alike. Even Republicans and Democrats who\u2019ve tried to work together to strengthen Obamacare have failed. There was a bid last year by Sens. Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, that would have funded Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing subsidies and allotted more money for outreach and enrollment assistance for two years, while providing more flexibility to states to adapt the law\u2019s regulations to their needs. It was co-sponsored by 12 Republican and 12 Democratic senators, but ultimately collapsed amid bipartisan bickering and a dispute about abortion restrictions. And just as Senate Republicans are not likely to get on board with any House Democratic measures, whatever Senate Republicans come up with would be a non-starter with Democrats in the House. Cillizza: Now, the alternative. ACA is eventually upheld. What can Trump do \u2013 and what has he been doing \u2013 to undermine the law? Luhby: The Trump administration has been very busy trying to weaken the law \u2013 at least the individual market provisions, which most people associate with Obamacare \u2013 from within. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has been starving the open enrollment period of resources. The agency not only slashed the sign-up season in half for the 39 states that use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, but it cut the budget for advertising by 90% and for enrollment assistance by 80%. Also, it has opened up alternatives to Obamacare, particularly short-term health plans, which don\u2019t have to adhere to all of the law\u2019s protections, and made it easier for consumers to connect with agents who sell these policies. CMS Administrator Seema Verma has even bigger plans for the future. Her agency has given states sweeping new powers to alter the Affordable Care Act \u2013 allowing them to redirect the federal premium subsidies considered crucial to keeping the individual insurance market working well, for instance. These expanded waivers are expected to deepen the divide in health care coverage among the states, with red states seeking to weaken Obamacare\u2019s grip and blue states trying to bolster their Obamacare markets. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cAt this time in 2019, the ACA will be ____________.\u201d Now, explain. Luhby: \u201cIn the spotlight, since the health care will likely be a key focus of the 2020 presidential election.\u201d US District Court Judge Reed O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling will likely be appealed up to the Supreme Court, where it could be overturned. But that\u2019s not certain. If the decision is upheld, Republicans will be on the hot seat to find a way to save the health insurance coverage of millions of Americans, not to mention figure out how to handle all the other provisions that the Affordable Care Act embedded into the nation\u2019s health care system. If the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land, Democrats will have the upper hand as the protectors of those with pre-existing conditions. Some 58% of respondents said they trust the party more to continue the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provisions, compared to 26% who chose Republicans, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation election tracking poll released in mid-October. Among independents, some 60% said Democrats would do a better job maintaining the protections, while 19% picked Republicans. And if the Supreme Court has yet to render a decision, everyone will be waiting to learn the law\u2019s fate.",

But it did again put a rare spotlight on one of the Supreme Court\u2019s least known but most important justices \u2013 as did his pungent questioning in oral arguments this week. As a lawyer faltered in the face of one of Alito\u2019s distinctive hypothetical questions on Thursday, Alito insisted, against his reputation as a tough interlocutor on the bench: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a surprise question, or a particularly difficult one.\u201d Through his opinions, Alito, who succeeded centrist Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor in 2006, has moved the court to the right on reproductive rights, religious freedom, job discrimination and campaign finance regulations. Since the February 2016 death Justice Antonin Scalia, Alito has anchored the right wing of the nation\u2019s high court with Justice Clarence Thomas. The addition of Trump appointees Justice Neil Gorsuch, in 2017, and Brett Kavanaugh in October, could bolster in upcoming years Alito\u2019s unflinching conservatism \u2013 to further restrict abortion rights, for example, and to continue last session\u2019s support of the Trump administration legal agenda. The New Jersey native with a caustic wit who still draws attention for his grimaces, rolled eyes and other expressions, stands out as a quirky, somewhat awkward figure among his colleagues on the right and the left. President George W. Bush, who appointed him, wrote in his 2010 memoir about loosening up Alito, a lifelong Phillies fan, with talk of baseball. At a welcome dinner at the court, the other justices even arranged for an appearance by the Phillie Phanatic mascot. More critically for the law, Alito has written some of the court\u2019s most substantial and controversial, opinions, from the 2007 Lilly Ledbetter pay-discrimination case to last term\u2019s labor union dispute. The latter reversed a 40-year-old precedent that had permitted public employee unions to charge non-members fees for collective bargaining activities. Alito\u2019s approach to the law has put him on the rightward flank of the court, alongside justices Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. The threesome, for example, recently sought to block a US district court trial over the Department of Commerce\u2019s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. (The court majority let the trial continue, and the court later said it would hear an appeal on a related evidentiary question in February.) Thirteen years ago, when President George W. Bush nominated Alito for the O\u2019Connor seat, law professors and legal experts speculated about how far the court might turn to the right \u2013 not unlike the current situation as Kavanaugh has succeeded the moderate conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy. Supreme Court double jeopardy case could impact presidential pardon power With Alito, those predictions immediately turned to reality. One year after his appointment, for example, the justices reversed course on an abortion controversy, upholding by a 5-4 vote a federal ban on a late-term procedure that critics called \u201cpartial birth.\u201d In an earlier case, while O\u2019Connor was still on the bench, the justices had struck down a similar state ban as interfering with a woman\u2019s right to end a pregnancy. (Some medical experts said the procedure, known medically as intact dilation and extraction, was the safest for women in certain circumstances.) Alito has similarly made a difference in religion cases with votes and opinions that would allow more religious expression in public. In a 2014 case, he was in the five-justice majority to uphold Christian prayers before council meetings in Greece, New York, and then wrote a separate concurring statement further defending legislative opening prayers and rejecting a key objection of the four dissenters as \u201creally quite niggling.\u201d In a separate 5-4 case in 2014, combining religious interests and reproductive rights, Alito wrote the court\u2019s opinion to allow the Hobby Lobby craft chain and other Christian-run for-profit corporations to escape an Obama administration rule that their insurance cover contraceptives. The regulation arose from the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Based on his past record, he could play a key role this term in dispute over a World War I Memorial cross on public land in Maryland, challenged as a breach of the constitutional separation of church and state. The Trump administration has been urging judges to rein in federal regulations, for example on the environment, and Alito has long joined in some conservative skepticism for agency regulations. Yet, he has also chastised his colleagues for chipping away at \u2013 but not directly confronting \u2013 a 1984 court precedent, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, that says judges should defer to agency interpretation of their legal power. \u201cIn recent years, several members of this court have questioned Chevron\u2019s foundations,\u201d he wrote in a June dissent. \u201cBut unless the court has overruled Chevron in a secret decision that has somehow escaped my attention, it remains good law.\u201d On the bench, Alito stands out with his sharp, methodical approach to questioning lawyers during oral arguments. His queries often involve layered hypothetical questions that can trap advocates. That happened earlier this year in a controversy over a Minnesota law that prohibited people from wearing any T-shirts or other clothing with a political insignia inside polling places on Election Day. A group called the Minnesota Voters Alliance challenged the ban on First Amendment grounds, and as the justices pressed the state lawyer defending the prohibition\u2019s breadth, Alito said, \u201cThe problem is that so many things have political connotations, and the connotations are in the eye of the beholder. \u2026 It\u2019s an invitation for arbitrary enforcement.\u201d The attorney defending the state prohibition insisted that it covered items that are \u201cclearly political.\u201d Brett Kavanaugh tries to shun the spotlight he can't avoid \u201cA shirt with a rainbow flag?\u201d Alito asked, eliciting a hesitant, \u201cyes, unless there was an issue on the ballot that related somehow to gay rights.\u201d Then Alito asked about a shirt that bearing the phrase \u201cParkland Strong,\u201d a reference to February\u2019s high school shooting in Florida that left 17 people dead. The state lawyer said he thought that would be allowed. Alito persisted, \u201cEven though gun control would very likely be an issue? \u2026 How about an NRA shirt? \u2026 How about a shirt with the text of the Second Amendment? \u2026 How about the First Amendment?\u201d The Supreme Court ended up striking down the prohibition on a 7-2 vote as a violation of the First Amendment\u2019s free speech guarantee. In a case Thursday testing a longstanding \u201cseparate sovereigns\u201d exception to the Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause, Alito was skeptical of a lawyer\u2019s assertion that the original understanding of the Constitution would forbid dual prosecutions for the same offense. \u201cSo, today,\u201d Alito began, \u201clet\u2019s say a group of American tourists are murdered by terrorists in a foreign country, and there is a prosecution in the foreign country for murder \u2026 and it\u2019s not a sham prosecution, but it\u2019s a fairly inept prosecution, lack of prosecutorial investigative resources in a poor country, and it results in an acquittal or a conviction with a very light sentence. And your position is that there could not be a prosecution here in the United States under the statute enacted by Congress to permit the prosecution of individuals who murder Americans abroad?\u201d \u201cSo let me address that in a few different ways\u2026. \u201d the lawyer began. \u201cCould you just answer whether that\u2019s correct or not?\u201d Alito rejoined, as the arguments continued, and the lawyer appeared unable to draw majority support for his position that separate sovereigns \u2013 typically the US government and a state \u2013 should not be able to prosecute a person for the same offense. After Trump last month criticized a US district judge\u2019s action in an asylum case and referred to the judge as an \u201cObama judge,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts issued a statement that said: \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.  What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d That led the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, to respond by bringing up the Obama-Alito incident from 2010. \u201cChief Justice Roberts rebuked Trump for a comment he made abt judge\u2019s decision on asylum I don\u2019t recall the Chief attacking Obama when that Prez rebuked Alito during a State of the Union,\u201d Grassley tweeted. Chief Justice Roberts rebuked Trump for a comment he made abt  judge\u2019s decision on asylum   I don\u2019t recall the Chief attacking Obama when that Prez rebuked Alito during a State of the Union But that\u2019s not exactly what happened. The controversy began with the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision on January 21, 2010, striking down federal regulations on corporate and labor union spending in elections, based on the First Amendment. On January 27, at a State of the Union address, Obama disparaged the ruling and referred at one point to the opening of \u201cfloodgates\u201d to special interests, including \u201cforeign corporations.\u201d As is customary, Supreme Court justices were sitting in the first two rows for the President\u2019s address. Caught on national TV coverage, Alito mouthed \u201cnot true,\u201d likely responding to the fact that the ruling did not cover foreign corporations. If Obama noticed Alito\u2019s expression at the time, he said nothing about it. Weeks later, Roberts complained in a speech at the University of Alabama about the State of the Union atmosphere, where the justices must remain silent as members of Congress cheer, and sometimes jeer, throughout a President\u2019s speech. Three years after that Alito moment, his facial expressions in response to a dissenting opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made headlines. In the staid courtroom, Alito had just presented the majority\u2019s opinion in a pair of cases limiting the reach of federal law against job discrimination based on race or sex. Then as Ginsburg began reading portions of her dissenting opinion from the bench, saying the majority had diluted the force of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Alito shook his head and rolled his eyes. The Atlantic ran a story with the headline, \u201cJustice Alito\u2019s Inexcusable Rudeness.\u201d The Washington Post posted a column with this headline: \u201cJustice Samuel Alito\u2019s middle-school antics.\u201d For his part, Alito declined to comment then and declined an interview request for this story. Ginsburg brushed off the incident at the time, and in an interview a few weeks after it happened remarked, \u201cI\u2019m in such good company. I\u2019m in the company of the President.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The midterm election was not just an opportunity to change the face of Congress and statehouses nationwide. Voters in 37 states also considered ballot measures on social and political issues such as health care, marijuana and election policies.  Some were initiated by citizens, others by lawmakers. The questions included whether to restrict abortion access, expand Medicaid, or change voting requirements. Here are some of the ballot measures we\u2019re keeping an eye on nationwide. We\u2019ll continue updating the results as they come in. Three measures in three states concerned abortion access and funding. In Alabama and West Virginia, voters approved changing their state constitutions to say that they do not protect the right to an abortion or require funding of abortions. Abortion wasn't always taboo in America Alabama\u2019s Amendment 2 will also change the state constitution to say that it supports the rights of unborn children, giving them constitutional protections. West Virginia\u2019s Amendment 1 also prevents state taxpayer money from being used to pay for abortions for those on Medicaid. Oregon voters rejected Measure 106, which would have prohibited publicly funded health care programs from covering abortion. Voters in six states \u2013 Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, North Carolina and Oklahoma \u2013 voted to approve some version of a measure often called \u201cMarsy\u2019s Law.\u201d South Dakota passed one in June. The proposals varied from state to state, but each would add specific protections for victims of crime to a state\u2019s constitution. Such protections include the right to be notified about hearings or the release of the accused, the right to restitution or the right to refuse an interview or deposition at the request of the accused. Supporters of Marsy\u2019s Law say it gives victims more say in what happens in their cases. Opponents, including the American Civil Liberties Union, said victims already have these types of rights through state laws and warned that enshrining victims\u2019 rights in state constitutions creates a false equivalency between them and the rights of the accused. They warn that Marsy\u2019s Law could undermine the rights of the accused and divert resources from those in need. Washington state\u2019s initiative 940 would change the legal standard for use of deadly force in officer-involved shootings. It would effectively lower the bar for prosecuting officers by establishing a good faith standard for opening fire. The measure would also require law enforcement officers to receive ongoing training in violence de-escalation and how to interact with people with mental health issues. And it would establish a duty for officers to render first aid. Florida voters passed Amendment 4, which restores voting rights for felons after they complete their sentences, including parole or probation, except for those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense. The law is expected to give the right to vote to 1.5 million people. Ohio voters in May approved a statewide measure to establish a new redistricting system. Four more states \u2013 Colorado, Michigan, Missouri and Utah \u2013 weighed similar measures for their state legislatures, their congressional districts, or both. Measures passed in Colorado and Michigan. The Colorado initiative will create a 12-member independent redistricting commission instead of having the state legislature draw district maps. Michigan\u2019s Proposition 2 establishes a 13-member redistricting commission and provides criteria for members and maps. More states considered measures related to voting requirements and ballot access. Voters in Arkansas and North Carolina approved amendments requiring voters to present a photo ID to vote in person. Maryland voters chose to authorize the general assembly to pass legislation that lets qualified people register to vote on Election Day. Ballots in Michigan and Nevada asked whether to allow automatic voter registration for those who interact with certain government agencies. Six measures on four state ballots concerned the legalization of recreational or medical marijuana. Voters in Michigan approved a measure that allows people 21 and older to use marijuana and changes current violations from crimes to civil infractions. Why weed is stuck in a legal limbo Missouri had three competing measures. All of them proposed to legalize marijuana for medical purposes, but with different proposed sales tax amounts and revenue uses: - 2% tax, with revenue to be spent on veterans\u2019 services, drug treatment, education and law enforcement - 15% tax, with revenue to be spent on a biomedical research institute - 4% tax, with revenue to be spent on health care services for veterans Voters in Utah are deciding whether to legalize medical marijuana, and Michigan and North Dakota voters weighed citizen initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana. Oklahoma voted in June to approve medical marijuana. Two measures in two states proposed increasing the minimum wage to $11 by the year 2021 in Arkansas, and to $12 by 2023 in Missouri. Four measures on four state ballots concerned Medicaid expansion or funding for Medicaid expansion. Voters in Idaho, Utah and Nebraska considered whether to require their state governments to accept the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. In Montana, voters had the chance to force the state to continue accepting the expansion. Nebraska, Utah and Idaho voters said yes to expanding Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, including individuals under age 65 whose income is 138% or below the federal poverty line who aren\u2019t eligible for other state insurance coverage. The initiatives in Montana and Utah proposed a tobacco tax increase and a sales tax increase, respectively, to provide funding for the expanded coverage. In January, Oregon voters approved a measure upholding legislation to provide funding for expanded Medicaid coverage through a tax on health insurers and revenue of certain hospitals. Your health is on the ballot in the midterm election In Nevada, Question 2 would amend the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 to remove taxes on feminine hygiene products, also known as the pink tax. Massachusetts voters chose to keep a state law that protects transgender people from discrimination in public places. Florida voters passed Amendment 13, which creates a prohibition on racing or betting on greyhounds or other dogs by 2020. More than 70% of Alabama voters approved an amendment to the state constitution authorizing the display of the Ten Commandments on state and public property, including schools, and to prohibit spending public funds to defend the constitutionality of the amendment. California\u2019s Proposition 6 would repeal fuel and vehicle taxes passed by the legislature in 2017 for road repairs and public transportation. CNN\u2019s Faith Karimi contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer will win his bid to be the next senator from North Dakota, CNN can project, ousting incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp and dealing a significant blow to Democrats\u2019 prospect at taking control of the Senate. Heitkamp, in the closing months of the campaign, was widely considered the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in the Senate, given Trump won North Dakota by 36 percentage points. That position was cemented when, weeks before Election Day, her campaign mistakenly identified sexual assault survivors in an ad, forcing the Democrats to emotionally apologize and promise to make up for the mistake. Heitkamp, in a move many Democrats applauded by questioned as political risky, decided to vote against Brett Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court who was confirmed despite being accused of sexual assault, which he denied. The Kavanaugh hearings became a contentious matter in the race, with Heitkamp arguing that she had to vote against the nominee to be able to look at herself in the mirror at night. The vote, however, was a boon for Heitkamp\u2019s fundraising. In the roughly two weeks after her vote against Kavanaugh, Heitkamp raised just over $12.5 million, money that was funneled directly into her the millions worth of ads her campaign ran in the final months. Cramer ran towards Trump throughout the race, looking to tap into the same base of voters that propelled him to the White House in 2016. Cramer accused Heitkamp of being out of step with North Dakota voters, slamming some of her votes on abortion and against the Republican tax plan.",

            "article_content": "We\u2019re in Paul B. Johnson State Park, and Democratic congressional candidate Jeramey Anderson is cleaning his campaign\u2019s RV. \u201cI just kind of like doing it,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cIt\u2019s an escape from my norm, I guess.\u201d With the bugs Windexed off the RV\u2019s windshield, Anderson changes from his Tulane T-shirt and flannel pajama pants into a button-down shirt and jeans. He\u2019s ready for the sixth day of his \u201cPeople\u2019s Tour\u201d \u2013 a campaign trip to all 14 counties in the congressional district that he\u2019s a long shot to win on November 6. The 26-year-old isn\u2019t a political newbie. Five years ago, a month shy of his 22nd birthday, he was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives, becoming the youngest African-American ever elected to a state legislature. Now he\u2019s ready for the next step. He\u2019s running to represent Mississippi\u2019s 4th Congressional District in the US House. The Moss Point native did not choose an easy road: He\u2019s facing three-term Republican Rep. Steve Palazzo, who beat his opponent two years ago by 37 points. How millennials could kill politics as we know it if they cared to A former Marine, Palazzo is a pro-Trump Republican who supports a strong national defense, opposes abortion and supports low taxes. Anderson is pro-abortion rights and pro-gun reform. His campaign platform focuses on raising the minimum wage, improving public education and implementing criminal justice reform. In a state with some of the most restrictive laws around abortion and some of the most lenient concealed carry laws in the country, Anderson is going against the grain. He believes that if he focuses on creating better communication and bipartisanship with his constituents, he can rake in votes from people who would have otherwise disagreed with his policies. \u201cI always tell my community, we\u2019re not going to always agree on every issue,\u201d Anderson says, \u201cBut the fact that we can come and sit down and talk about issues that are important to us and find solutions that work for everyone, that\u2019s how we move forward.\u201d Anderson says the purpose of this seven-day tour around the 4th district is to just show up and listen to people in the small rural parts of Mississippi that politicians don\u2019t often visit. \u201cWe\u2019re touching folks that have been forgotten about, that are disengaged from political process,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir votes count, too. Their voices count. Their issues are important to me as well.\u201d On the fifth day of the \u201cPeople\u2019s Tour,\u201d Anderson walked into Wards, a Mississippi fast-food chain in the town of Lumberton (population: 2,112) and started introducing himself to a group of men drinking coffee and chewing on eggs and bacon. The rest of the booths were full of people who were waiting for him to speak, but for these men, this was an unwelcome intrusion to their morning hangout. \u201cNever heard of him until today,\u201d Tim Hargrove said with a shrug. \u201cHe interrupted my breakfast,\u201d chimed in Joe Phelan, who identified himself as an anybody-but-Hillary-guy. \u201cBut I liked him.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see the other guy come to Wards and talk to us,\u201d Hargrove said, adding that he\u2019d never seen Palazzo come to his small town. That\u2019s a sentiment Anderson heard echoed a lot on his seven-day tour. Carol Brody, 60, of Vancleave, Mississippi, attended Anderson\u2019s rally in Biloxi with her husband, Philip. The couple, who identify themselves as independents, have tried \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to meet with Palazzo at scheduled town halls in years past. Inside Georgia Democrats' 'voter protection' war room \u201cPalazzo doesn\u2019t want to meet with any of his constituents or his opponents. He thinks he\u2019s going to rule from that little microcosm he has,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to town hall meetings where he did not show up. They just put his picture on the chair.\u201d Palazzo released a statement at the time, saying town halls \u201care no longer used for elected officials to share information and take questions\u201d but that he is willing to talk to anyone from his district who calls his Biloxi office. He did not respond to CNN\u2019s multiple requests to participate in this story. As a young black man in a state whose flag still incorporates the Confederate battle flag, Anderson is well aware of how people may perceive him when he knocks on their doors. It still makes him nervous and frustrated when people look at his age or race and don\u2019t give him a chance. \u201cBefore you can even get into whether you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican, it\u2019s your appearance,\u201d Anderson says. But he believes that doesn\u2019t represent the majority in Mississippi. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good people here, that want to see change,\u201d Anderson says, \u201cAnd that is what we\u2019re trying to do with this election, is energize and restore hope to this community, restore hope to this district and let them know that you have another option.\u201d A big goal of this tour, too, is encouraging young people and African-Americans who\u2019ve been historically more disengaged with the political process to vote. Only 64% of people aged 18 to 34 were registered to vote in 2016, compared to 72% of those over 34, according to the US Census Bureau. And November could deliver several firsts for African-American representation, including the first black female governor in the United States. \u201cWhile we\u2019re traveling talking about \u2018Jeramey Anderson for Congress,\u2019 we\u2019re also talking about other candidates and why it\u2019s so important to just get out and exercise your right to vote,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cThat\u2019s a very big voting population, but it\u2019s an underperforming population.\u201d Anderson attributes his interest in politics to his grandfather, Alton Joseph Sr., whom he describes as a community organizer who \u201cdidn\u2019t need a title to run.\u201d His grandfather passed away in 2010 of Alzheimer\u2019s. Three years later, Anderson ran for his first political seat. He still lives in his grandfather\u2019s home, now with just his grandmother, Fanny. Anderson\u2019s made a lot of sacrifices getting into politics at such a young age. He hasn\u2019t found the time to pursue a romantic relationship while in office, and he rarely goes out with friends. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to kind of get a lot of young people to understand that I can\u2019t go to the clubs with them,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cI always tell my friends, \u2018We can do the same things, but my name will hit the papers before (yours) do.\u2019\u201d Still, he doesn\u2019t regret how he\u2019s spent his 20s. Five factors that will impact the Hispanic vote in the midterms \u201cThe benefits of service, the benefits of helping your community, to me outweighs any of those sacrifices that I had to give up,\u201d he says. The slogan for his campaign \u201cRestoring Hope\u201d is by no means a coincidence. Former President Barack Obama is his biggest idol. He said he shook Obama\u2019s hand once back in 2008. He called the moment \u201csurreal.\u201d \u201cI saw what could possibly one day be me.\u201d",

Noem\u2019s team now seems to realize that.\u201d Noem directly denies that she didn\u2019t take Sutton seriously, but in an interview with CNN, she acknowledged that the race has been closer than she expected. \u201cI knew (the primary) would be hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about the general.\u201d The Sutton-Noem race anchors a series of gubernatorial contests in prairie states \u2013 namely South Dakota, Oklahoma and Kansas \u2013 where Democrats are on offense in 2018. The Democratic Governors Association has grown confident they could flip at least one governor\u2019s mansion in the three so-called \u201cTornado Alley\u201d states with authentic, local candidates who break the mold of how lean-Republican voters in each state see Republicans. South Dakota's Kristi Noem aims to break state's glass ceiling That Sutton is running a competitive race in South Dakota has also come as a surprise to some national Democrats who look at the fact that President Donald Trump nearly doubled Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s vote total here in 2016. In the state, however, Democrats and Republicans alike see Sutton as a formidable candidate with a singular story. It\u2019s that crossover appeal that is apparent when Sutton campaigns. As the candidate made his way down the Dakota Days Parade here in Vermillion and later shook hands at a tailgate for the University of South Dakota Coyotes, around a dozen people used some variation of the same move to back him: They grabbed Sutton\u2019s hand, leaned down to talk to the wheelchair-bound politician and in a markedly hushed tone said they would vote for him in November. \u201cI might be one of those lifelong Republicans who votes for you,\u201d said a Sioux Falls businessman who declined to provide his name. Sutton is getting used to picking up endorsements from whispering voters and those Sutton voters have distinct reasons for secrecy \u2013 \u201cI have too many Republican clients,\u201d said the businessman. But it\u2019s all the same to the Democrat: He just wants their vote as he looks to shock Republicans by defeating Noem, a South Dakota native who announced her run for governor almost two years ago. Even she, though, acknowledged Sutton\u2019s candidacy is potent in the state where she was born and raised. \u201cHe\u2019s the most talented candidate they have had in 30 years,\u201d Noem said of Sutton, who would be the youngest governor in the country if he wins. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you can underestimate a good story. The story of his accident and his tenacity in that situation really resonates with the people of South Dakota.\u201d Sutton is confident he will shock the political establishment and win come November, and he isn\u2019t shy about acknowledging that the accident that ended his rodeo career and landed him in a wheelchair is a big part of his success. \u201cIt is a big part of it,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cIt is a South Dakota story. It is about how we persevere in the face of challenges.\u201d After rolling down the Main Street parade route, where countless voters yelled his name \u2013 \u201cBillie, Billie\u201d a la the viral Bud Light ads titled \u201cDilly Dilly\u201d \u2013 he smiled and thought about how much his life changed in a decade. \u201cKnowing what I know now,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d There is little in common between Sutton and Trump. The cowboy-hat-wearing South Dakota Democrat backed Clinton in 2016, was raised about as culturally far away from New York City as one can get and had dreams of making the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas before a horse he was riding flipped in a chute and paralyzed him. But there is one key similarity: Sutton\u2019s primary campaign pledge to change the status quo in South Dakota and end corruption sounds remarkably similar to the messaging that vaulted Trump to the White House two years ago. Sutton has seized on a series of stunning scandals in South Dakota\u2019s state government and run hard as the candidate who will alter the status quo and clean out Pierre, the state\u2019s capitol. Listening to Sutton tell it, both in person and in television ads, the message is could easily be distilled as draining the swamp. \u201cIt\u2019s a similar message,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is one of the reasons I am getting a lot of support from a lot of people that supported President Trump. \u2026 They are tired of politics as usual, they want something different, they are tired of career politicians.\u201d The messaging has proven effective. People who meet Sutton often reference his ads, his story and his pledge to shake things up. And even Republicans who have voted for Noem for years are moved by his messaging. \u201cWe are in a state where it is hard for a Democrat to win,\u201d Mark Knippling, a 54-year old who lives near Noem in Watertown, South Dakota, said after meeting Sutton. \u201cBut if he is anyone who can do it, he\u2019s the man who can probably do it.\u201d Noem rejects the idea that Sutton has cornered the market on anti-corruption or change. She said she views herself as the change candidate, despite the fact her governorship would continue Republican rule. \u201cWe have had issues in South Dakota,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what we can trust and what we can put faith in and lately (the people of South Dakota) have struggled to put faith in their state government.\u201d It would be near impossible to know that the woman sitting in the misty cold of Hayti (pronounced Hay-tie), South Dakota, for a Friday night football game between the Hamlin Chargers and the Deuel Cardinals represented the entire state in the House. But there sat Noem, with her mother and daughter, cheering as her son and six of her relatives helped the Chargers throttle the Cardinals in nine-man football game that night. It\u2019s nights like this, despite the cold, that made Noem want to leave Washington and come back home. She said she was fed up with Congress and missed the place where she was born, met her husband and raised a family. So, when she announced she was running mere days after the 2016 election, it seemed like she would be a shoe in: She was a popular, four-term congresswoman whose business background seemed like a perfect fit to run the state. But then came a tougher than expected primary and stout challenge during the general election. \u201cTraditionally the governor\u2019s races aren\u2019t that tough when it gets to Republican and Democrats, at least recently,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, no, I don\u2019t think anyone could anticipate the environment.\u201d That environment is partly fueled by a deep antipathy towards Congress. Though Noem\u2019s neighbors are eminently friendly to her \u2013 parents from the opposing team even asked her campaign staff for lawn signs during the game \u2013 there is a sense in 2018 that the most damning line on a politician\u2019s resume is member of Congress. Trump's farmer bailout begins. USDA spends $1.2 billion to buy surplus food Noem rejects the idea that she is being weighed down by her time in Congress. She won the primary after all, she says. \u201cThere is a natural distaste for Congress, but I think these races can be pretty individualized,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is easy for him to say that. I don\u2019t think it resonates very well, but he says it a lot.\u201d Noem has mostly run towards Trump. But on trade, she has come out against the President whose trade wars have led to slumping commodity prices. Noem grew up growing soybeans, corn and wheat and said she still hears about the trade concerns from her brothers who continue to operate the family farm. \u201cAgriculture is our number one industry by far, and so the trade discussion has been tough,\u201d Noem said. \u201cFarmers are struggling, they need a price or their commodities. It is just a tough time in rural American because of that.\u201d Noem\u2019s campaign is clearly concerned about Sutton\u2019s standing. After not spending much on TV advertising for months, allowing Sutton to air upbeat ads about his unique story, the Noem campaign has begun to hit the Democrat. \u201cDemocrat Billie Sutton, he\u2019s anything but independent,\u201d says a narrator in a recently release Noem ad, which seeks to tie her opponent to Clinton. \u201cDemocrat Billie Sutton, he is more like Hillary Clinton than you think.\u201d The attack previews what will likely be the final salvo of the Sutton-Noem race: Questions about who represents the state\u2019s values. Before heading home to serve a buffalo stew she had on the stove, Noam said she would win because voters would realize \u201cshe reflected the values of South Dakota,\u201d a not so subtle hint that Democrats can\u2019t represent the state\u2019s red population. Sutton vehemently disagreed. \u201cWe value honesty here in South Dakota and she hasn\u2019t been telling the truth,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cMy values are South Dakota values \u2013 honesty, integrity and hard work. And people want something different.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect that a businessman who might vote for Sutton is from Sioux Falls.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke aggressively cast Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as \u201call talk and no action\u201d during the second \u2013 and potentially final \u2013 debate of the Texas Senate race Tuesday night. The hour-long debate showcased a major shift in tone for O\u2019Rourke, who rarely says the names of Cruz or President Donald Trump on the campaign trail and has often bypassed his opportunities to take direct shots at Cruz. The change in approach could be necessary for O\u2019Rourke. A new CNN poll out Tuesday showed Cruz with a 7 percentage point lead \u2013 consistent with other recent surveys that have shown the Republican clearly ahead. O\u2019Rourke had $22.9 million in the bank at the close of the third quarter of 2018, giving him enough money to advertise across the state in the race\u2019s final three weeks. Minutes into the debate, as Cruz accused O\u2019Rourke of supporting a $10-a-barrel tax on oil, the El Paso congressman shot back that Cruz is \u201cdishonest.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s why the President called him \u2018Lying Ted,\u2019 and it\u2019s why the nickname stuck \u2013 because it\u2019s true,\u201d he said. The vote in question was a 2016 House GOP resolution that rejected the idea of a new oil tax. O\u2019Rourke and most Democrats opposed the measure. CNN poll: Cruz leads O'Rourke with three weeks to go \u201cCongressman O\u2019Rourke sides with liberal extremists on the national level, instead of the people of Texas \u2013 instead of jobs in Texas,\u201d Cruz said. O\u2019Rourke continued his more combative approach through the debate. He highlighted Cruz\u2019s 2016 bid for the Republican presidential nomination, saying Cruz hasn\u2019t visited all of the 254 counties in Texas, \u201cbut has been to all 99 in Iowa.\u201d \u201cTed Cruz is for Ted Cruz,\u201d he said. The debate showcased differences over social media regulation to combat foreign interference in election \u2013 O\u2019Rourke said he was open to it; Cruz was opposed \u2013 and a stark split on the Supreme Court and the potential for the reversal of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. In a line that underscored Democratic worries that O\u2019Rourke hasn\u2019t won over enough Latino voters, Cruz said: \u201cThe people of Texas, and I will say, especially the Hispanic community, we don\u2019t want to see taxpayer-funded, Medicaid-funded abortions.\u201d A question over trade led to a battle about party control in Congress. Cruz claimed that O\u2019Rourke is the only Senate Democratic candidate this cycle who has explicitly supported Trump\u2019s impeachment. He said that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s election would lead to \u201ctwo years of a partisan circus, shutting down the federal government in a witch hunt on the President.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus after your last six years in the US Senate,\u201d O\u2019Rourke fired back. \u201cIf you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that? You are all talk and no action.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m against tariffs. I\u2019m against the trade war,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf we\u2019re erecting barriers and shutting down trade, that is a bad thing. This is one of the few issues where Congressman O\u2019Rourke and I have some common ground.\u201d The difference, Cruz said, is that he has a relationship with Trump and can advocate for expanded trade. He praised Trump for negotiating a \u201cnew NAFTA, a new trade deal,\u201d with benefits for Texas. O\u2019Rourke criticized Trump for alienating trade partners like Canada and Mexico, and said his trade war is \u201churting no state more than it\u2019s hurting Texas.\u201d Trump has thrown his support behind Cruz and plans to host a rally for his former rival\u2019s benefit. On Wednesday morning, he tweeted that the senator has \u201cdone so much for Texas\u201d and that O\u2019Rourke would \u201cblow it all.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Senate voted to send Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court on Saturday, ushering in a generational conservative majority and delivering a huge victory to President Donald Trump after a vicious confirmation battle inflamed by allegations of sexual assault against the nominee. As shrieks of \u201cshame, shame, shame\u201d echoed from the public galleries, divided and angry senators voted 50-48 to endorse a lifetime seat on the court for Kavanaugh. The protests underscored the vital importance of an appointment that will have sweeping consequences for some of the nation\u2019s most contested disputes over abortion, LGBT rights, the scope of presidential power and the role of religion in society. Hours later, Kavanaugh was sworn in at a private ceremony at the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Roberts and the man he will replace, retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. Outside, a crowd of noisy protestors gathered, and was eventually pushed back from the ornate building\u2019s steps by police. The bitter fight over Kavanaugh now moves into the epicenter of the campaign for the midterm elections in November. Republicans are convinced it will motivate their sleepy base. Democrats believe a backlash against the GOP from women voters could help deliver the House of Representatives. And the nature of the fight over Kavanaugh will trigger recriminations inside the Senate and political reverberations outside for years to come. In the end, Republicans were able to use their stranglehold on Capitol Hill and the White House to muscle through the confirmation in a power play that reflected the momentous importance of Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory over Hillary Clinton. Still, it was a close-run thing: Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination was nearly derailed by Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations that the judge assaulted her when they were teenagers in the 1980s, which sparked uproar and forced Republicans to delay the confirmation vote for a week to allow time for a supplemental FBI background check. Trump took a victory lap before an enthusiastic crowd at a rally in Topeka, Kansas, on what he hailed as a \u201chistoric night.\u201d \u201cI stand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our nation, our people and our beloved Constitution,\u201d Trump said. He dismissed the allegations against Kavanaugh by accusing Democrats of waging a \u201cshameless campaign of political and personal destruction.\u201d How senators voted on Brett Kavanaugh Democrats furiously accused the GOP of short-circuiting efforts to examine Ford\u2019s allegations and of rushing the nomination through while ignoring the changed political dynamics surrounding complaints of misconduct against powerful men ushered in by the #MeToo movement. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the nomination \u201cone of the saddest moments in the history of the Senate,\u201d and said, \u201cthis chapter will be a flashing red warning light of what to avoid.\u201d Republicans \u201cconducted one of the least transparent, least fair, most biased processes in Senate history, slanting the table from the very beginning to produce their desired result,\u201d he added. How Kavanaugh maneuvered to win his confirmation fight Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described Kavanaugh as a \u201csuperstar.\u201d McConnell, who stalled Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the court in his final year in office and for whom the new conservative majority represents a defining achievement, predicted that Democratic tactics during confirmation battle would electrify Republican voters in November. \u201cThey managed to deliver the only thing we had not been able to figure out how to do, which is to get our folks fired up,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThe other side is obviously fired up, they have been all year.\u201d President Donald Trump's winning streak Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation leaves the Senate traumatized with Republicans and Democrats as estranged as at any time in recent memory, reflecting the cavernous divides in the country itself during a presidency that has ignited rare political passions. It represents the culmination of a decades-long project by the conservative movement to construct a like-minded majority on the Supreme Court which has been a defining and unifying cause in successive congressional and presidential campaigns. The new profile of the court immediately makes Trump a consequential president, for all of the chaos and discord that rages around his White House, and means his legacy will include an achievement that eluded previous Republican presidents \u2013 all of whom had more authentic conservative credentials. The ferocious nature of the confirmation battle could also have an impact on the Court itself, as Kavanaugh\u2019s vehement and politicized defense of his own behavior raised questions about his temperament and whether he could genuinely be a honest broker and implementer of the law in the most sensitive cases. The path to Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation cleared on Friday when two wavering Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona, said they would vote for Kavanaugh after concluding that Ford\u2019s allegations, voiced by her in an emotional hearing last week, could not be corroborated. Their move meant that McConnell could forge the narrowest of majorities to clear Kavanaugh, despite the fact that another Republican, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, opposed him. Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat facing a tough re-election fight in West Virginia, a state where the President rolled to victory in 2016, also supported Kavanaugh. Murkowski ultimately withdrew herself from the final tally as a gesture of goodwill toward her Republican colleague, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who supports Kavanaugh but was in Montana to walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding. But the move did not affect the ultimate result of the vote. Murkowski to vote 'present' on Kavanaugh so Daines won't have to leave daughter's wedding CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly, Laurie Ure, Manu Raju, Eric Bradner, Sophie Tatum and Dan Berman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Brett Kavanaugh is set to become the Supreme Court justice who inaugurates a conservative majority for a generation, after wavering Republicans closed ranks to give him sufficient votes for confirmation in a historic victory for President Donald Trump. Partisanship questions threaten to shadow Kavanaugh on the court The final Senate vote is expected Saturday, but enough senators have committed to backing him after a tumultuous political battle inflamed by allegations by California professor Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers in the early 1980s. A dramatic and draining showdown that held Washington in thrall for weeks finally moved toward resolution when Maine Sen. Susan Collins \u2013 the last undecided GOP senator \u2013 said in a combative speech on Friday afternoon that she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh, after concluding there was not sufficient corroboration for Ford\u2019s claims. Despite being a key player in the most partisan confirmation process in decades, Collins said she hoped Kavanaugh, a former political operative in the George W. Bush White House, would work to depoliticize the court. Bush, in fact, had spoken repeatedly to Collins over the past few weeks and reassured her about his character and temperament, a person familiar with the conversations says. \u201cSo that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is restored. \u2026 I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh,\u201d Collins said, in a 40-minute speech. Earlier, another GOP holdout, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said he would back Kavanaugh. And after Collins spoke, Sen Joe Manchin, a Democrat of West Virginia who is running for re-election in a staunchly pro-Trump state, said he would also back confirmation, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill surrounded by protesters urging him to change his vote. One lone Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said she would oppose Kavanaugh. The vote to confirm Kavanaugh, when it comes, will reconcile a cause that has unified and electrified the conservative movement dating to its rebirth as a modern political force led by former President Ronald Reagan. Once Kavanaugh is seated, Chief Justice John Roberts, by no means a moderate, will become the swing vote on the Supreme Court. The conservative majority will have a sweeping impact on American life, possibly for decades, on issues that are at the epicenter of the nation\u2019s poisoned political debate including LGBT rights, the limits on presidential power, campaign finance, abortion and the role of religion in society. The Kavanaugh saga however also forced the GOP to come down on the opposite side of the #MeToo movement, that has forced society to give greater credence to women who make allegations about powerful men and is now a significant political force. The decision may have further eroded the GOP\u2019s already shaky status among women voters. Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation could also spike Democratic enthusiasm in midterm elections in just five weeks \u2013 especially in House races. Still, failing to confirm Kavanaugh would have been a disaster for the Republicans and the party\u2019s victory may also energize conservatives. Collins has a reputation as a moderate and a pragmatist who rarely trades in the fiercely partisan rhetoric of colleagues on both sides of the aisle and often seems an odd fit for a party taken over by Trump. But as soon as she began speaking, she adopted her party\u2019s arguments on Kavanaugh and rejected Democratic critiques of the judge on issues including birth control, health care, his views of expansive presidential power and abortion. When it came to Ford\u2019s allegations, she said the evidence did not preclude the notion that she had been assaulted at a party on the night in question or elsewhere. But she said that none of the four witnesses who Ford said were present could remember any such event. She said that the confirmation process was not a trial and therefore the allegations did not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201c[F]airness would dictate that the claims at least should meet a threshold as more likely than not.\u201d She went on to say that the allegations \u201cfail to meet the more likely than not standard.\u201d \u201cTherefore I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court.\u201d Murkowski in contrast, defied her party and voted against advancing the nomination. \u201cHe\u2019s not the right man for the court at this time,\u201d Murkowski told reporters. Kavanaugh\u2019s candidacy has stirred a furious political debate and whipped up protests and recriminations and a clash between the mostly male power structure of the Republican Party and the emerging influence of the #MeToo movement which has become an important force in liberal politics. The road to final confirmation became clearer on Friday morning when Kavanaugh survived a crucial procedural vote 51-49 in the Senate and Collins and Flake lined up with their Republican colleagues \u2013 an outcome that was in doubt up until the last minute. Kavanaugh repeatedly denied Ford\u2019s allegations and condemned Democrats for drilling down on his teenage drinking and yearbook postings. But emotional testimony Ford delivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, and the judge\u2019s own explosive and partisan performance, raised doubts about his temperament and left his hopes hanging by a thread. In the tense moments before the morning vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for whom a conservative Supreme Court majority would represent a career defining achievement, accused Democrats of trying to derail Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination with delaying tactics and obstruction \u2013 even though he is a possibly Washington\u2019s most accomplished master of the dark arts. \u201cWe know the Senate is better than this, we know the nation deserves better than this,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cLet\u2019s seize the golden opportunity before us today, confirm a Supreme Court justice who will make us proud.\u201d Had the vote fallen short, it would have thrown a major blow to the nomination and throw the possibility of confirmation into serious doubt. There was immense relief at the White House where Trump watched a vote that takes him one final step closer to becoming the Republican president who enshrined a conservative majority on the Supreme Court \u2013 an achievement that will elevate him in history. \u201cVery proud of the U.S. Senate for voting \u2018YES\u2019 to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh!\u201d the President tweeted, moments after the final tally became official. Ford\u2019s lawyers said their client did not watch the vote unfold on television. Friday\u2019s vote took place after yet another extraordinary twist in the Kavanaugh confirmation process, when the nominee penned a last minute Wall Street Journal op-ed that was seen as an effort to put to rest questions about his temperament. \u201cI was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in the Journal. \u201cI might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband and dad. I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all my daughters.\u201d CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly, Dana Bash, Manu Raju, Ted Barrett, Ashley Killough, Gloria Borger, Jeff Zeleny, Kevin Liptak, Aaron Pellish, Jeremy Herb, Sunlen Serfaty and Dan Berman contributed to this report.",

Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the political arm of the nonprofit reproductive health care organization, Organizing for Action, a group closely tied with former President Barack Obama, and Swing Left, a progressive congressional organization that sprung up out of the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, will have hundreds of organizers knocking doors and working in seven states on Saturday in what the groups are calling a Women\u2019s Health Day of Action. Kavanaugh swing votes facing new surge of progressive pressure While the groups, particularly Planned Parenthood, have opposed Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court over his views on abortion, the recent spate of news on alleged sexual assault and excessive drinking in the nominee\u2019s youth, which culminated in closely watched testimony by professor Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh, has altered the focus of the door knocking with volunteers now looking to draw a direct line between women\u2019s health and the allegations against Kavanaugh, which he has denied. \u201cWomen are fed up with politicians dismissing sexual assault survivors, undermining access to Planned Parenthood health centers, and reshaping the Supreme Court to gut the constitutional right to safe, legal abortion,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \u201cWomen are poised to serve a reckoning this November that is decades in the making, and this partnership is a signal that we\u2019re all right there with them.\u201d Although the debate over Kavanaugh has put the Senate in the spotlight, namely Democrats Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp, Republican and Democratic operatives alike believe that the impacts of the national conversation on Ford\u2019s allegations could most directly impact key House races that are being fought in the suburbs of America\u2019s largest cities. Door knocking efforts like the one organized by Planned Parenthood, Organizing for Action and Swing Left are an effort to turn those fears into reality, especially in key House races where the balance of the legislative body could be determined in November. Organizers, according to the groups, will be in AZ-2, CA-10, CA-45, CA-48, IA-1, IA-3, NJ-11, NJ-7, NJ-3, TX-7, TX-23, TX-32, VA-2, VA-5, VA-7 and VA-10 on behalf of Democrats in each race. All races are competitive and highlight how Democratic organizations believe in anti-Kavanaugh messaging with an emphasis on women\u2019s health, especially in contested House districts. \u201cIf we want to protect women\u2019s health from the constant Republican attacks, it\u2019s not enough to just vote this year,\u201d Adrienne Lever, political director at Swing Left, said in a statement. \u201cWe need each and every person to knock on doors and make calls so that we can break out of our silos and bring about electoral change.\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination has invigorated the fight over women\u2019s reproductive rights in the United States, with groups like Planned Parenthood fearing his ascension to the highest court could mean the end to laws outlined in Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision. Recent polling has shown, however, that voters overwhelmingly believe Roe v. Wade should remain the law of the land. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released in July found 71 percent of American voters think the decision should stand, with 23 percent believing it should be overturned. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found a similar landscape, with 67 percent of Americans believing the decision should stand and 29 percent thinking the decision should be overturned. Organizers of Saturday\u2019s day of action said those sentiments contribute to an enthusiasm on the left to stop Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination and get voters to the polls in November. \u201cThe level of engagement and enthusiasm OFA has seen this cycle, among seasoned organizers and brand new volunteers alike, has been overwhelming,\u201d said Katie Hogan, executive director of Organizing for Action. \u201cAnd women have been leading the charge.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Progressive activists and other left-leaning outside groups are ramping up their efforts to convince a bipartisan band of swing senators to vote against the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Their 11th-hour efforts \u2013 mostly targeting Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Arizona\u2019s Jeff Flake, along with uncommitted Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota \u2013 got another surge of adrenaline on Tuesday night, when President Donald Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who testified that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. Less than two hours after Trump spoke in Mississippi, the liberal group Demand Justice posted a digital ad with a recording of the President\u2019s words played over a black and white still image of Ford \u2013 eyes closed, right hand raised \u2013 before she gave her opening statement last week. \u201cTrump mocking Dr. Blasey Ford at a rally makes it clear: if these so-called Senate moderates vote for Kavanaugh now, they are siding with Trump\u2019s cruelty over the bravery of a sexual assault survivor,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for Hillary Clinton and the Justice Department, who leads the new nonprofit. The ad, he said in a tweet when it was first posted, will target voters in Maine, Alaska and Arizona. Why Susan Collins is in a very unfamiliar place on the Kavanaugh vote The People\u2019s Defense, a grassroots coalition led by the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, also began running a new radio spot on Tuesday, taking aim at Flake, the retiring Republican who set in a motion a deal last week to delay the Senate vote on Kavanaugh pending a new FBI background investigation. \u201cSenator Flake now faces a choice: confirm the most dishonest nominee in modern history, or stand with the people, the truth, and the rule of law,\u201d the ad says before giving listeners an office number to call. On the ground, groups like MoveOn and the Center for Popular Democracy, whose co-executive director Ana Maria Archila was one of the two women who confronted Flake last week \u2013 in a raw and wrenching scene that quickly went viral \u2013 over his decision then to back Kavanaugh, are seeking to mobilize nationwide protests and vigils. \u201cThousands of people are taking action in DC and in communities across the country to put pressure on key Senators and urge them to do the right thing by voting down this nomination,\u201d said MoveOn spokesman Karthik Ganapathy. Anger over the initial allegations, he said, had been compounded by \u201cthe Judiciary Committee\u2019s eagerness to ignore them, and stirred by Dr. Blasey Ford\u2019s compelling testimony last week.\u201d The \u201cBe A Hero\u201d campaign, led by activist Ady Barkan, a young father dying of ALS, is promoting the gatherings on Wednesday night and what they hope will be mass protests against Kavanaugh in Washington on Thursday and Friday. In a series of tweets late Tuesday, Barkan called on the anti-Kavanaugh grassroots to \u201cthrow in $25 to help us pay for the buses and food and bail money that we need to resist this nomination.\u201d For those who planned to travel, he and others have circulated a form for gathering names and contacts that also asks, \u201cCan you participate in civil disobedience/risk arrest?\u201d \u201cWhen millions of Americans heard Dr. Ford\u2019s historic testimony last week, they believed her,\u201d Barkan said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAnd in Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s rage, sexual assault survivors felt their own private pain echoed on a national scale. Now they are refusing to be ignored \u2026 We have never seen this kind of activist intensity around a Supreme Court nomination.\u201d In the aftermath of Ford\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill and, as importantly, the politically charged and at times petulant defense offered by Kavanaugh, the American Civil Liberties Union took the rare step on Saturday of publicly opposing his confirmation. On Monday, it began running more than $1 million of ads in four states \u2013 West Virginia, Alaska, Nebraska and Colorado \u2013 that compared the judge to former President Bill Clinton and convicted sex offender Bill Cosby. Trump\u2019s performance on Tuesday night in Mississippi, coming perhaps only a day or two before the FBI wraps its follow-up probe into Kavanaugh, enraged activists, emboldened the organized opposition and potentially swung the political calculus for the fence-sitting senators whose decisions will ultimately decide Kavanaugh\u2019s fate. On Wednesday, the Republicans among them condemned Trump\u2019s remarks in interviews. Collins called them \u201cjust plain wrong,\u201d Murkowski said they were \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Flake, who labeled the comments \u201cobviously insensitive and appalling\u201d was the only one of the three to say they would not affect his final decision. Manchin, who along with Heitkamp is facing a tough red state re-election fight this fall, said Trump\u2019s words \u201cwere wrong,\u201d but that he remains \u201ccompletely undecided\u201d on Kavanaugh pending the FBI\u2019s findings. The pair\u2019s indecision has drawn the ire of progressive left groups. The Justice Democrats, a relatively new organization that scored a series of notable wins during the primaries backing candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, is both rallying supporters to protests and casting Heitkamp and Manchin\u2019s deliberations as evidence of the need for progressive alternatives. Manchin easily defeated a Justice Democrats-backed progressive challenger, Paula Jean Swearengin, in a Democratic primary this spring. But the group\u2019s executive director Alexandra Rojas said his potential vote to confirm Kavanaugh would further \u201cvalidate the necessity of getting in early (to primary contests) with working class candidates.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Manchin and Heitkamp are undecided right now,\u201d Rojas said, \u201cis exactly the reason why we challenged Manchin.\u201d",

            "article_content": "David Hansen tried to get the words out. \u201cI lost my health care,\u201d he began to say, his voice unexpectedly cracking, barely audible in the din of a people-packed and sweltering warehouse in Nicholasville, Kentucky. At 59, a US Navy veteran and registered Republican, Hansen lowered his head, unable to look at Democrat Amy McGrath, the congressional candidate headlining this political event in the small town outside Lexington. A retired US Marine and a decade and a half his junior, McGrath put her hand on his shoulder. Hansen had voted for Trump in 2016. He also voted for the Republican congressman for Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District, Andy Barr. But Hansen\u2019s fortunes changed in 2017 after he had a stroke, an event so debilitating, he said, he couldn\u2019t work, losing his health care coverage. He said he now pays for outside insurance, even though he\u2019s entitled to get service from the Department of Veterans Affairs, because he said the care there is so poor. \u201cThere\u2019s 535 people up there and they\u2019re not doing anything,\u201d he said of the members of the House and Senate. Hansen\u2019s struggles illustrate why health care is among the top issues in the midterm elections, dominating political ads, particularly among Democrats, who are attacking Republicans over their efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. In August, a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS found that 81% of voters considered health care important to their vote, including nearly half (48%) who said it was \u201cextremely important.\u201d 30-second ad on health care tells the story of Democrats in 2018 \u201cCongress isn\u2019t doing anything,\u201d Hansen reiterated, frustration woven into every word. \u201cThey need to fix the health care program because it\u2019s broken. They have to get off their high horse and just do it.\u201d Some of the same politically insurgent reasons he voted for Trump are why he\u2019s at a McGrath rally. \u201cShe\u2019s not a politician,\u201d said Hansen, pointing out the national Democrats didn\u2019t back McGrath in the primary. \u201cShe\u2019s also been in the military. She knows what it means to honor her commitments.\u201d McGrath leaned over to Hansen and said the words that sealed his support for her. \u201cI\u2019m going to work very hard. That\u2019s all I can promise you.\u201d The issue of health care has made Hansen a Democratic voter in the upcoming midterm elections. And in this ruby red area of Kentucky, it seems he is not the only one. Indeed, there are some signs of a blue wave in a corner of the Bluegrass State. To the standing-room crowd that came to see her in a district Trump won by 16 percentage points, McGrath raised her fist in the air, punctuating her pledge to voters. \u201cThis election is about the soul of our country,\u201d she said into a microphone, applause reverberating against the walls of the warehouse. \u201cWe need to stand up and be a part of this and move our country in the direction that you know America is. \u201cHealth care is a right for all Americans. Education is a right. I\u2019m doing my part for my country right now. I\u2019m doing the best that I can and I\u2019m gonna work my ass off for you!\u201d People stood up, waving \u201cAmy McGrath\u201d fans and stomping their feet. Two days later, McGrath opened up rural offices in Irvine and Campton, both towns with populations of less than 2,500. Her campaign is pushing deeper into rural Kentucky than any other national Democrat has before, say local organizers, driven by the promise to protect and fix health care. Kentucky expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, adding nearly half a million people to Medicaid rolls. Approximately 1.4 million people receive Medicaid benefits in Kentucky in 2018, about one-third of the state\u2019s population, according to the state\u2019s Cabinet for Health and Family Services. While most of the funding to cover the program comes from the federal government, state officials calculate the state\u2019s budget will be potentially $300 million short by 2020. Incumbent Barr, who won his last election by more than 20 points, is running neck-and-neck with McGrath, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll. Barr has won his previous races promising to repeal and replace Obamacare. Now Democrats are turning that health care issue against incumbents like Barr. Along with her core issue, McGrath has a soaring and patriotic biography to impress the electorate. By age 12, she knew she wanted to fly military fighter jets, only to be told that a federal law prohibited women from combat roles. She wrote letters to members of Congress, including her own US senator, Mitch McConnell, who she said never replied. During her senior year in high school, the exclusion was lifted, and McGrath took advantage. She graduated from the Naval Academy and flew combat missions for the US Marine Corps in both Afghanistan and Iraq. She retired as a lieutenant colonel and after the 2016 election, again felt the need to serve, this time in Congress. She had given birth to her third child just months earlier, she had never run for office and her own party already had its own favorite: Lexington Mayor Jim Gray. Undeterred, McGrath introduced herself in a campaign ad that went viral and  turned her into a national darling of progressives eager to fund a new generation of politicians. She took an anti-party establishment, anti-Washington message into all 19 counties of her district and upset the Democratic favorite, winning the primary. \u201cThe Democratic national party didn\u2019t really want me, if you haven\u2019t noticed,\u201d she said to more than one rally. \u201cThe cool thing about that is, I don\u2019t owe them anything. I just owe you guys.\u201d If McGrath is working to step out of the lane of her party, Barr is running to stay on pace with Trump. At the Powell County Parade, Barr stood between two banners, \u201cVeterans for Barr\u201d and \u201cRe-elect Congressman Andy Barr\u201d before leading his supporters. \u201cOK, say it with me everyone. 1, 2, 3: Make America great again!\u201d chanted Barr. The congressman then started jogging down the parade route, smiling and shaking hand after hand, pausing often to talk to the people watching. Barr may be a three-time incumbent, but the affable, sixth-generation Kentuckian clearly enjoys the campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s a very common person,\u201d said Eddie Barnes approvingly. \u201cHe\u2019ll sit here and talk to anyone, doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s rich or poor,\u201d said Barnes, a Powell County resident and retired police officer working the parade. He\u2019s the kind of voter who has re-elected Barr twice in this formerly Democratic district and who could stomp any nascent blue wave here. \u201cHe\u2019s a good person and we don\u2019t have a problem with him.\u201d On the days CNN followed Barr at campaign events, he made multiple stops, from high school students at a military academy to the Central Kentucky Right to Life Walk. His schedule was packed hour by hour, taking only Sunday off to go to church with his family. At each stop, he underscored conservative values, like limiting access to abortion, and what a Democratic victory would mean to conservative ideology. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have a more important congressional election that will make a difference in the future of the US House of Representatives,\u201d said Barr at the Right to Life event. \u201cYou have an opportunity to make a profound difference in the cause for life in November.\u201d Barr understands while Trump is not on the ballot, the President hangs over his race. \u201cThere are suburban Republicans who are maybe dissatisfied with the President\u2019s personality but there\u2019s people, like in this part of the district, who are very supportive of the President,\u201d said Barr on the sidelines of the Powell County parade. While health care and tariffs may hang in the balance of critical issues for Kentucky, Barr is betting conservative ideology will bring his base to the ballot box. Barr\u2019s attack ads have called McGrath \u201ctoo liberal for Kentucky,\u201d using audio recordings in which she calls herself a \u201cfeminist\u201d and \u201cpro-choice.\u201d \u201cThere are fundamental differences between me and my opponent. I\u2019m a conservative and she\u2019s a liberal,\u201d said Barr. \u201cAt the end of the day, we trust the voters. Every two years they give us a report card and we\u2019re hearing good things,\u201d Barr said. Donald Storm is one of those supportive voters. Storm is a retired major general in the Kentucky Army National Guard. While he said McGrath\u2019s service makes him proud as a fellow veteran, he added, \u201cTalk is cheap.\u201d \u201cAndy has spent a lot of his political time and capital and his staff has helped veterans and families,\u201d said Storm. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what he\u2019s done, what he\u2019s proven and where he comes down on people. I think that\u2019s going to make him a winner.\u201d On the opposite end of the political spectrum there are those who believe the grassroots are growing, they are blue not red, and they are being boosted by McGrath. \u201cOn most days, it feels like Republicans in Irvine outnumber Democrats 5 to 1,\u201d said Miller, a registered Democrat, with McGrath at the opening of a rural campaign office in Estill County. \u201cBut not today,\u201d she said, as chants of \u201cAmy, Amy\u201d broke out all around.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration is opening \u201ca comprehensive review of all research involving fetal tissue\u201d and canceling a contract that conservative lawmakers said supported \u201cresearch using the body parts of children whose lives have been violently ended by abortion.\u201d Fetal tissue is a modern equivalent of the stem cell research question that confronted Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama: how to balance ethical and moral questions about life, health, abortion and emerging science aimed at addressing stubborn medical issues. The Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement it \u201cis now conducting an audit of all acquisitions involving human fetal tissue to ensure conformity with procurement and human fetal tissue research laws and regulations.\u201d The review will consider \u201cthe serious regulatory, moral, and ethical considerations involved.\u201d Fetal tissue is generally obtained through abortions, and is used to develop cells that \u201cmimic many of the properties that they have in a living body, and therefore can be used as a model for researchers studying basic biological processes,\u201d according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2015. The National Institutes of Health now spends around $100 million a year on research involving human fetal tissue, government data shows. The issue was brought to the fore in recent months by a comparatively small contract for fetal tissue the Food and Drug Administration announced in June. It planned to purchase around $16,000 of \u201chuman fetal tissue\u201d for tests to determine how humans might respond to medications. \u201cFresh human tissues are required for implantation into severely immune-compromised mice to create chimeric animals that have a human immune system,\u201d FDA said at the time. \u201cThis human immune system allows us to test biological drug products for safety and efficacy.\u201d How exactly fetal tissue is used for medicine The organization contracted to provide the fetal tissue, Advanced Bioscience Resources, did not return a call from CNN seeking comment Tuesday morning. Human tissue was required, FDA said, for testing drugs that only work on humans. More than 80 House Republicans wrote a letter to the FDA earlier this month calling for the cancellation of the contract. \u201cUnborn children are not commodities to be bought and sold,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe practice of conducting research using the body parts of children whose lives have been violently ended by abortion is abhorrent.\u201d The move did not satisfy the Susan B. Anthony List, a high-profile group that opposes abortion and spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each election cycle to support and oppose candidates. \u201cCanceling a single contract and conducting a review is a small step forward, but overall is completely inadequate,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group\u2019s president. Andrew Rosenberg of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocate for science steering public policy, said reviews like the one HHS is conducting can have a \u201creally chilling effect.\u201d He voiced concern that scientists conducting \u201ccritically important research\u201d will be put under the type of scrutiny that makes their universities or other institutions nervous about funding their work. Bush handled controversial but promising research involving stem cells, which generally involved the cells of embryos rather than fetuses, with a compromise that allowed federal funding of research using cells that existed at the time. He also publicly called for the use of alternatives. The HHS statement said the administration will push for alternatives to fetal tissue research be \u201cfunded and accelerated.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Brett Kavanaugh is facing the confirmation of a lifetime. President Donald Trump announced in July that he is nominating the DC Appeals Court judge to the Supreme Court bench. Whether Kavanaugh is successfully confirmed has become a question of Senate math. Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority in the chamber. And ahead of the midterms, all eyes are on the 10 Democrats running for re-election in states Trump carried in 2016. Three of them \u2013 North Dakota\u2019s Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Indiana\u2019s Sen. Joe Donnelly and West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin \u2013 voted for Trump\u2019s last Supreme Court nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, last year and face re-election in 2018. Democrats are also watching Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who have expressed concerns, among other issues, about any action to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling. For those who have already weighed in, here\u2019s the latest look at what senators have said about Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination and how they will vote: Bill Nelson of Florida on July 9 \u2013 \u201cI look forward to meeting with the President\u2019s nominee in the coming weeks to discuss his views on several important issues such as protecting women\u2019s rights, guaranteeing access to health care for those with pre-existing conditions and protecting the right to vote, just to name a few. I will make my decision after that.\u201d Jon Tester of Montana on September 12 \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to be reviewing the transcript of the judiciary hearing pretty hard over the next couple of days to see how he answered the questions, if he answered the questions. And then also I want to add the in-person meeting. I\u2019m going to be visiting with him about issues on security and campaign finance and choice and other things.\u201d Joe Donnelly of Indiana on September 12 \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m still reviewing everything at this point.\u201d Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota on September 12 \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m still reviewing the record.\u201d Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada on July 9 \u2013 \u201cI plan to meet with Judge Kavanaugh in the coming months and will review his qualifications thoroughly.\u201d Chris Coons of Delaware on September 12 \u2013 \u201cI sent Judge Kavanaugh a substantial list of questions for the record yesterday, maybe Monday. I\u2019m giving him a week to respond. I\u2019ll make up my mind and make a public announcement after that. As should have been clear from my questioning in the confirmation hearing, I have grave concerns about his judicial philosophy around presidential power and a number of settled and important individual liberty rights.\u201d Chuck Schumer of New York on July 9 \u2013 \u201cI will oppose Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination with everything I have, and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same. The stakes are simply too high for anything less.\u201d Kamala Harris of California on July 9 \u2013 \u201cJudge Brett Kavanaugh represents a direct and fundamental threat to that promise of equality and so I will oppose his nomination to the Supreme Court.\u201d Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on July 9 \u2013 \u201cI will be a \u2018no\u2019 vote on this nominee. Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s record and writings \u2013 which I have reviewed \u2013 signal an extreme hostility to the precious rights and liberties that make our nation great.\u201d Bob Casey of Pennsylvania on July 9 -- \u201cI will oppose the nomination the President will make tonight because it represents a corrupt bargain with the far right, big corporations and Washington special interests.\u201d Patty Murray of Washington state on July 10 \u2013 \u201cI voted against Judge Kavanaugh when he was nominated for the circuit court and I strongly oppose this nomination now. I will be urging my colleagues to stand with me in rejecting him, and in calling on President Trump to send us someone who would stand with women, workers and families, and who would truly commit to respecting settled law and the rights and freedoms we hold so dear. And I will be urging people across the country to stand up, speak out and make their voices heard.\u201d Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin on July 12 \u2013 \u201cAfter reviewing this nominee\u2019s record, I know why powerful special interests in Washington selected Judge Brett Kavanaugh to work on the Supreme Court for them, not the people of Wisconsin,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe people of Wisconsin need a fair, impartial and independent Supreme Court Justice who will stand up for them, not for powerful special interests. I don\u2019t have confidence that Judge Kavanaugh would be that justice.\u201d Tammy Duckworth of Illinois on July 19 \u2013 \u201cBased on his own words and writing, I fear that Judge Kavanaugh would be the deciding vote in critical cases that restrict a woman\u2019s freedom to make health care decisions with her doctor, tear away protections that guarantee Americans with pre-existing conditions may obtain health insurance and empower a president of the United States to act as though he is above the law. Judge Kavanaugh should not be confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice, and he will not have my vote.\u201d Brian Schatz of Hawaii on September 4 \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough. As long as the Republicans refuse to release 96% of the Kavanaugh records, this process is illegitimate. Every other Supreme Court nominee has turned over nearly everything, and I am now convinced they are hiding something. I will vote no.\u201d Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire on September 10 \u2013 \u201cJudge Kavanaugh\u2019s past rulings on abortion demonstrate that he is willing to infringe on a woman\u2019s constitutionally protected right to make her own reproductive decisions, and his failure to answer questions about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for pre-existing conditions puts the health and well-being of millions of Americans at risk. After careful consideration of his record and reviewing the limited documents made available to the US Senate, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot support Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to serve on the US Supreme Court.\u201d Mark Warner of Virginia on September 11: \u201cI would have liked to meet with Judge Kavanaugh personally before deciding how I\u2019d vote. Even attempted to set up a meeting with him, though unfortunately the White House never responded. So I\u2019m just going to say it. I\u2019ll be voting no on Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d Claire McCaskill of Missouri in a statement on September 19: \u201cWhile I am also uncomfortable about his view on Presidential power as it relates to the rule of law, and his position that corporations are people, it is his allegiance to the position that unlimited donations and dark anonymous money, from even foreign interests, should be allowed to swamp the voices of individuals that has been the determining factor in my decision to vote no on his nomination.\u201d Dianne Feinstein of California on July 9 \u2013 \u201cHis views are far outside the legal mainstream when it comes to access to health care, executive power, gun safety, worker protections, women\u2019s reproductive freedom and the government\u2019s ability to ensure clean air and water, to name a few. \u2026 We need a nominee who understands that the court is there to protect the rights of all Americans, not just political interest groups and the powerful.\u201d Patrick Leahy of Vermont on July 9 \u2013 \u201cBased on an initial review of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s record, we are right to be concerned. \u2026 He must not evade fundamental questions that judicial nominees have answered for decades until recently. He needs to explain why we should believe he would be a justice for all Americans, independent of the President and the ideologically driven interest groups that selected him.\u201d Bernie Sanders of Vermont on July 10 \u2013 \u201cI do not believe a person with those views should be given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. We must mobilize the American people to defeat Trump\u2019s right-wing, reactionary nominee.\u201d Angus King of Maine on September 12: \u2013 \u201cBrett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is one of the most important votes I will take in the Senate \u2013 and after carefully studying his record (at least the part that is available) and judicial philosophy, I have decided that I will vote no on his confirmation.\u201d Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on July 9 \u2013 \u201cWhile I have not met Judge Kavanaugh, I look forward to sitting down for a personal meeting with him. I intend to review Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s decisions on the bench and writings off the bench, and pay careful attention to his responses to questions posed by my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\u201d Jeff Flake of Arizona on July 9 \u2013 \u201cAs I have said before, approving a nominee who will interpret the Constitution rather than legislate from the bench should be our top priority. I look forward to meeting with Judge Kavanaugh and reviewing his record throughout the confirmation process.\u201d Susan Collins of Maine on September 12 \u2013 \u201cI am still completing my due diligence. I spent an hour today going through the committee\u2019s sensitive documents at the Judiciary Committee that have not yet been released. I would note, however, that every document Democrats asked to have cleared and released was released by the order of the Justice Department and President Bush. So what I\u2019m finding is that a lot of the information has not necessarily been accurately presented, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s really important I continue my review. I am also going to be talking to the judge later this week with a few more questions that I have.\u201d Ted Cruz of Texas on July 9 \u2013 \u201cBy any measure, Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most respected federal judges in the country and I look forward to supporting his nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d Dan Sullivan of Alaska on July 9 \u2013 \u201cI think he meets all the qualifications of what we as a Senate should be looking for in terms of the confirmation process and I plan on supporting Judge Kavanaugh as a next associate justice of the Supreme Court.\u201d Orrin Hatch of Utah on July 11 \u2013 \u201cI was very pleased to meet with Judge Kavanaugh this morning. He\u2019s handled himself very well and comes with a lot of experience, coming from the second-greatest court in the land. I expect his confirmation to go well. I very much enjoyed talking with him for a few minutes.\u201d Rob Portman of Ohio on July 11 \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody better qualified to be on the United States Supreme Court. He obviously has had a distinguished record.\u201d Ben Sasse of Nebraska on July 12 \u2013 \u201cThe judge I met today doesn\u2019t sound anything like the imaginary bogeyman that Democrats are railing against. I think Nebraskans are going to like this humble judge who is clearly most proud of his two daughters. Judge Kavanaugh is a serious thinker and a careful jurist who understands that our system of checks and balances and our First Amendment freedoms make America great.\u201d John Cornyn of Texas on July 12 \u2013 \u201cI have known the judge for a long time. I\u2019ve followed his record. I think he is the type of judge that we need on the Supreme Court, not one who is going to be making policy or legislating from the bench. I think he very much shares the same judicial philosophy as Justice Gorsuch so I look forward to supporting his confirmation.\u201d Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia on July 12 \u2013 \u201cAfter meeting with Judge Kavanaugh today, I\u2019m even more certain that he is a man of integrity and that he understands and respects the responsibilities of a Supreme Court justice, which is why I plan to support his nomination. Judge Kavanaugh and I had a wide-ranging discussion about our separation-of-powers system, the court\u2019s responsibility to properly apply laws passed by Congress to guard against overreach by federal agencies, and the importance of respecting precedent to promote stability in the law. I know Judge Kavanaugh will be an excellent addition to the court and will honor and strengthen this important branch of our democracy.\u201d Thom Tillis of North Carolina on July 18 -- \u201cAs a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I look forward to strongly supporting his nomination and will work to ensure the Senate moves swiftly to confirm him.\u201d Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi on July 25 \u2013 \u201cI firmly believe the President made a great decision in nominating Judge Kavanaugh.  I\u2019m excited about his nomination, and look forward to supporting him and being an advocate for his confirmation.\u201d Richard Shelby of Alabama on July 30 \u2013 \u201cConfirming Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most important things we will do during this Congress.  I look forward to supporting his nomination to serve on our nation\u2019s highest court, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\u201d Rand Paul of Kentucky on July 30 \u2013 \u201cAfter meeting Judge Kavanaugh and reviewing his record, I have decided to support his nomination. No one will ever completely agree with a nominee (unless of course, you are the nominee). Each nominee however, must be judged on the totality of their views character and opinions,\u201d Paul wrote in a series of tweets. Marco Rubio of Florida on August 1 \u2013 \u201cHis answers reflected what the American people voted for when they elected the president and a Republican-controlled Senate less than two years ago. I intend to support his nomination because of his stated commitment to interpreting and defending the Constitution as written.\u201d John Thune of South Dakota on August 1 \u2013 \u201cI will support his nomination to the Supreme Court this fall, and I hope my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, reach the same conclusion about this well-qualified, mainstream jurist.\u201d John Boozman of Arkansas on August 1 \u2013 \u201cThe first thing that stood out when Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination was announced was his exceptional record on the bench and the high level of respect his peers hold for him. After having an opportunity to visit with him, I find Judge Kavanaugh to be even more impressive than his resume and reputation alone suggest. I am confident that he is a fair and thoughtful jurist who will respect the Constitution and refrain from legislating from the bench. He is the exact type of judge we need on the Supreme Court.\u201d John Hoeven of North Dakota on August 1 \u2013 \u201cI appreciated the opportunity to meet with Judge Kavanaugh today to discuss his judicial philosophy. Having served for more than a decade on the federal appeals court, he is highly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanuagh has a strong record of upholding the law rather than legislating from the bench and his approach to the law shows a deep respect for the Constitution. Given his years of experience on the bench and his commitment to upholding the law, I believe that Judge Kavanaugh is a solid choice for the Supreme Court and I look forward to supporting his confirmation to serve on the Supreme Court.\u201d Ron Johnson of Wisconsin on August 15 \u2013 \u201cJudge Kavanaugh\u2019s impressive legal background combined with his compelling personal history makes his nomination an easy one to support. Most importantly, as I have reviewed his judicial record I am confident of his intent to apply the law as a judge, not alter it as a super-legislator. I look forward to voting to confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court once the Senate has thoroughly but expeditiously completed the confirmation process.\u201d Johnny Isakson of Georgia on August 16 \u2013\u201dHe\u2019s a regular guy. He\u2019s a brilliant man. He cares about his country deeply. He believes in his country and feels a responsibility he wants to assume at this time in life. I can\u2019t think of any better reason to vote for him. I\u2019m going to vote for him with pride, and I encourage my fellow senators\u2026 to join me as well.\u201d Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on September 4 \u2013 \u201cThe antidote to our problems in this country when it comes to judges and politics is not to deny you (Kavanaugh) a place on the Supreme Court. This is exactly where you need to be. This is exactly the time you need to be there.\u201d Todd Young of Indiana on September 6 \u2013 \u201cEarlier this week, I spoke with @WSBT about Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing. Judge Kavanaugh will be an excellent addition to our nation\u2019s highest court, and the Republican-led Senate will continue to move through regular order to confirm him.\u201d Richard Burr of North Carolina on July 9 \u2013 \u201cIn nominating Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, President Trump has put forth a highly qualified and respected candidate committed to the rule of law. Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s credentials are impeccable, and as a judge for the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit he has considered many of the most pressing legal questions of our time.\u201d Ted Cruz of Texas on July 9 \u2013 \u201cBy any measure, Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most respected federal judges in the country and I look forward to supporting his nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d Mike Enzi of Wyoming on July 19 \u2013 \u201cIt was great to talk with Judge Kavanaugh about his years of experience and dedication to the judicial system. He is an extremely well qualified nominee whose prior rulings and writings demonstrate his commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law. I appreciated his thoughtful answers to my questions and look forward to the Senate\u2019s consideration of his nomination this fall.\u201d This story will be updated with additional developments.

            "article_content": "As Republicans and Democrats reckoned Monday with new sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, both parties began to process how the rapidly shifting politics of the nomination fight might upend the midterm elections less than two months away. Republicans, already fearing their standing with suburban women, are confronting a potential disaster as they head into the first post-#MeToo election with a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault. Democrats, particularly those running in states President Donald Trump won in 2016, risk inflaming the Republican base, which could view the allegations as an unfair Democratic effort to halt Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. RELATED: Brett Kavanaugh, Christine Blasey Ford to testify on assault allegations in public Monday In the immediate aftermath of California professor Christine Blasey Ford publicly alleging that Kavanaugh had physically and sexually assaulted her at a party when he was 17 years old \u2013 which Kavanaugh has denied \u2013 Democrats and Republicans agreed the political impact of the still-developing story is not yet fully clear. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee planned hearings next Monday in which Ford and Kavanaugh would testify under oath. Those hearings come as early voting will begin in four states Friday. Other states will quickly follow, with voters in key states like California and New Jersey, both with several competitive House races, and Montana, Indiana, Arizona and Ohio, each with close Senate contests, among the first to begin casting ballots over the following three weeks. For Republicans, alienating women could hurt the party\u2019s Senate candidates and carry a heavy cost in other contests, particularly House races in moderate, suburban districts that could determine which party controls the chamber. It\u2019s \u201ca little more gasoline to the flames\u201d driving women who were \u201calready riled up\u201d to vote against congressional Republicans, said Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILY\u2019s List, a progressive group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights. These senators could make or break Kavanaugh's nomination \u201cBut it is on fire out there, and women voters in particular are ready to see big, big change,\u201d Schriock said. Clinging to a two-seat Senate majority, Republicans had for months pointed to Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination as their best tool to energize conservative voters who might otherwise sit out the midterms. \u201cAt this very moment the issue is moving so fast that accurate predictions are difficult to make,\u201d said Steven Law, the president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cI think it\u2019s likely this will inflame partisan energy on both sides \u2013 and that could make the confirmation vote a lose-lose proposition either way for red-state Democrat senators.\u201d Democratic senators up for re-election in red states were cautious Monday, refusing to signal whether they\u2019ll vote yes or no on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. The three Democrats who voted for Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation \u2013 Sens Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 each said they want Ford to have an opportunity to discuss the matter in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cProfessor Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard and Judge Kavanaugh deserves a chance to clear his name,\u201d Manchin said on Twitter, echoing several other red-state Democrats. \u201cBoth have said they are willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and I hope they will be given the opportunity to do that as quickly as possible.\u201d Timeline: How the Kavanaugh accusations have unfolded Republicans in competitive races were also cautious Monday, backing Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley\u2019s plans for additional hearings without addressing whether they support Kavanaugh. \u201cThis is a very serious allegation. Sen. Grassley said he\u2019s reaching out to both parties for more information, and Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford have said they are willing to provide testimony on this matter. That is a sensible way forward,\u201d said Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, the Republican nominee in the state\u2019s US Senate race. Right-wing groups were scrambling Monday afternoon to rescue the man they expected to deliver a long-term 5-4 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The Judicial Crisis Network launched a $1.5 million TV ad campaign featuring a close friend of Kavanaugh\u2019s. \u201cWe are not going to allow a last-minute smear campaign (to) destroy a good and decent man who has an unblemished personal record,\u201d a spokesman for the conservative group said. Democrats launched advertising campaigns of their own that would heap pressure on Republicans seen as swing votes. Demand Justice, a progressive group leading the anti-Kavanaugh fight, announced a $700,000 ad buy targeting four Republicans: Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada and Cory Gardner of Colorado. NARAL Pro-Choice America, a progressive group that opposes Kavanaugh, launched online advertisements Monday targeting Collins and Heller. The ads highlight Ford\u2019s accusation and urge Heller and Collins to vote against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Anita Hill's accusations did not hurt public support for Clarence Thomas in '91 Heller is the most vulnerable Republican senator up for re-election this year, in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Collins and Gardner are likely to be Democratic targets in 2020. Publicly, beyond the Judicial Crisis Network ad, Republican groups were largely silent about their strategies around Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination Monday. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee did not respond to a request for comment. Democratic operatives, meanwhile, said they believe new concern about a Trump nominee underscores one of their core arguments in this year\u2019s midterms. \u201cThis will intensify voters\u2019 already-existing feelings that there should be a check and balance on total Republican control of government, and that dynamic boosts Democrats,\u201d said one Democratic strategist working on Senate races. Another result of the accusation facing Kavanaugh, the Democratic strategist said, is that it keeps the national focus on Republicans \u2013 Murkowski and Collins, seen as swing votes \u2013 rather than red-state Democrats who had been facing political pressure. One reason operatives said the political impact of the accusation facing Kavanaugh is difficult to forecast is that much could change in the two months before the midterms. Trump defends Kavanaugh amid allegations Among the difficult scenarios to game out: If Kavanaugh is defeated or his nomination is withdrawn, it would launch a battle over a different nominee even closer to Election Day. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, downplayed the idea that killing Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination would come with political ramifications in November. \u201cKavanaugh, according to surveys I\u2019ve seen, isn\u2019t hugely popular around the country, and my sense is that if he doesn\u2019t get the nomination as a result of these revelations, then I don\u2019t see that having a major impact,\u201d Van Hollen told reporters Monday. \u201cIf he were to have to drop out because of recent revelations, I don\u2019t see how that would mobilize voters.\u201d Some Republican allies of Trump\u2019s White House questioned the credibility of Ford\u2019s allegations. But doing so comes with political risks, too. Donald Trump Jr. posted an Instagram photo depicting the letter Ford sent Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, in July accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault as an elementary-school style love note and referring to Ford\u2019s allegations as \u201cDems and their usual nonsense games.\u201d Pointing to Trump Jr.\u2019s post, Amanda Carpenter, a former aide to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and CNN political commentator, tweeted: \u201cKeep up these attacks and Trump won\u2019t only lose Kavanaugh as the nominee but the seat altogether when Dems make comments like this a campaign issue.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser now has a name, and the Republican Party\u2019s bid to swiftly lift him onto the Supreme Court seems to be spinning out of control. The emergence of California professor Christine Blasey Ford, and her willingness to testify to Congress about the allegations, unleashed a frenetic sequence of events Monday that threatened to unravel the confirmation process of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee, who had seemed on a smooth glide path to becoming the man to enshrine a conservative majority for a generation. Democrats demanded that Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process should be put on hold pending an investigation. A planned vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday on the nomination now appears to be at risk of slipping. In a significant development, one of the Republican senators who may hold Kavanaugh\u2019s fate in her hands, Maine\u2019s Susan Collins, called for both the nominee and his accuser to \u201ctestify under oath before the Judiciary Committee\u201d in a statement on Twitter. Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee. Ford\u2019s lawyer, Debra Katz, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Monday that her client would be willing to testify in public to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the allegations \u2013 which Kavanaugh has strongly denied. \u201cThe answer is yes,\u201d Katz said, adding that so far her client had not been asked by anyone to make an appearance. Kavanaugh too is willing to share his point of view and answer questions about the allegation, according to two sources close to the process. The judge confirmed that in a statement, saying he would be willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee \u201cin any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation.\u201d \u201cThis is a completely false allegation,\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s statement said. \u201cI have never done anything like what the accuser describes \u2013 to her or to anyone.\u201d Ford told The Washington Post that she went public about the alleged assault, which she says occurred more than three decades ago while she and Kavanaugh were in high school, because of the magnitude of his appointment. \u201cNow I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation,\u201d Ford told the paper, ahead of what is likely to be an ordeal characterized by political attacks and fearsome scrutiny of her life, family, mental health and political leanings. Ford\u2019s gambit looked set to provoke the kind of spectacle triggered by attorney Anita Hill\u2019s harassment claims against Clarence Thomas during his confirmation process in 1991. If so, it will elevate the debate on Kavanaugh from a Washington squabble to a national zeitgeist moment. Public testimony by Ford would significantly increase pressure on Republican senators who hold the key to Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to take her story seriously even as some conservatives argue that the allegations, and their emergence after three decades, is proof of a politically inspired plot by Democrats to derail the nomination. There was no immediate reaction from Trump to the latest developments. But the President\u2019s senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News: \u201cThis woman should not be ignored and should not be insulted. She should be heard.\u201d Kavanaugh was at the White House on Monday morning, as prospects mounted that he would again have to appear before the Judiciary Committee. Echoes of Anita Hill in allegations against Kavanaugh The showdown will unfold amid the still-unsettled politics of the #MeToo movement, which has transformed the way allegations by women of sexual harassment by now-powerful men, even from decades ago, are viewed by society. But it also takes place at a pivotal moment for the conservative movement, which is within reach of a goal it has pursued for decades of cementing a majority on the Supreme Court at a time of key rulings on issues like abortion, same-sex marriage and the role of religion in American life. That turbulent backdrop has not, so far, changed the relentless math of the GOP\u2019s Senate majority, but it could significantly increase the political cost to the party of confirming him. Ford\u2019s move puts a human face on what had previously been more an indirect, impersonal controversy and made it more difficult for Republicans simply to dismiss what, after all, is an accusation of a crime against a pivotal nominee. Dems call for delay of Kavanaugh vote after accuser comes forward Until Sunday, there was a feeling among many Republicans that Kavanaugh had been unfairly targeted, and was the victim of an 11th-hour Democratic bid to destroy his nomination. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein had known about the allegations for weeks, but did not bring them up during the confirmation hearings. That feeling was especially acute because Ford had chosen to make her allegations anonymously \u2013 although advocates pointed out that the privacy of women who say they have been assaulted must be preserved. Kavanaugh has categorically and unequivocally denied he did anything wrong, despite Ford\u2019s claims that at a party in the 1980s, he was drunk, forced himself upon her and tried to take off her clothes. Furthermore, Ford did not appear to report the alleged assault at a house in Washington\u2019s Maryland suburbs at the time. Kavanaugh was never investigated over it and the alleged assault was not uncovered by multiple FBI background checks conducted during his career in politics and as a judge. Ford says she has lived with the aftereffects of the alleged assault for years and that it caused her trauma and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Her account in the Post offers far more detail than has previously been available, another factor that could influence the politics of the nomination this week. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, is seeing his entire career and reputation put on the line in a controversy that is certain to draw in his young family and will surely tarnish his image even if he is cleared of wrongdoing and is confirmed to sit on the Supreme Court. The sudden developments place Republican senators who the White House is relying on to shepherd his nomination with a choice. Will they stick together in the view that Kavanaugh is being unfairly treated on accusations that date from decades ago? Or will they be forced by political and public pressure to agree to an investigation that could slow his confirmation? Presidential nominations often unfold according to an intangible logic. Even candidates that look unassailable can be suddenly weakened by sudden disclosures. Once a nominee is wounded, his or her confirmation hopes can quickly splinter as political support fractures, so Kavanaugh can ill afford any roadblocks, even if his prospects look good now. And any slowed momentum could give time for more problems to emerge and allow his fate to become even more embroiled in the midterm elections, which are only seven weeks away. Pressure will be especially intense on Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who have been seen as two Republicans who could be wavering on Kavanaugh over the issue of abortion. If those two senators oppose Kavanaugh and all of the Democrats stick together, his nomination could be defeated. So far, Collins is not saying whether the allegations, which first emerged in a letter sent in July that reached Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, would sway her vote on the nomination. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough to create the judgment at this point,\u201d she told CNN on Sunday evening. Ford\u2019s emergence might also change the political equation for Democrats running for re-election in red states, offering them an excuse to stick with their party despite calls of conservative constituents to support Kavanaugh. Republican Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley said that it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d that such \u201cuncorroborated\u201d allegations had emerged ahead of the committee vote. But there was just a hint of an opening for Democrats. Three Republican senators urge committee to hear out Kavanaugh accuser before vote A spokesman said that the Iowa senator was working to set up calls with Kavanaugh and Ford before Thursday\u2019s vote, and South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham raised the possibility that the committee should hear testimony from Ford. When asked about delaying the vote, Murkowski told CNN the committee should consider doing so. \u201cI think that might be something they might have to consider, at least having that discussion,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not something that came up during the hearings. And if there is real substance to this, it demands a response.\u201d And in another sign of potential trouble for Kavanaugh, two senators who are not running for re-election and are therefore insulated somewhat from the Republican base, Arizona\u2019s Jeff Flake and Tennessee\u2019s Bob Corker, said they need to hear more from Ford. \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that I\u2019m not comfortable moving ahead with the vote on Thursday if we have not heard her side of the story or explored this further,\u201d the Arizona senator told the Post. The future trajectory of Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is especially difficult to predict because of the change in how alleged sexual assaults are now handled in public life, following a long series of scandals that have felled key figures in politics, the media and Hollywood in recent months. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer played directly into the idea that the #MeToo campaign had changed everything. \u201cFor too long, when woman have made serious allegations of abuse, they have been ignored. That cannot happen in this case,\u201d Schumer said. At the very least, the decision of Ford to unmask herself offered Democrats a rallying point as they seek to make the Kavanaugh nomination and the fate of the Supreme Court generally a key issue in the midterm elections. Democratic senators had previously assailed Kavanaugh in his hearing over abortion and past rulings on corporations. They had also condemned the White House for withholding tens of thousands of documents relevant to Kavanaugh\u2019s time as a key aide to President George W. Bush. But Ford\u2019s emergence now gives Democratic candidates, especially those in suburban House districts where women voters are crucial, a chance to make some GOP lawmakers pay a significant price for the party\u2019s support of Kavanaugh. The spectacle of white, middle-aged or elderly men on the GOP bench voting to confirm Kavanaugh in the committee could prove a damaging image in districts that could turn on a younger, more diverse electorate.

            "article_content": "Pressure is mounting for a small group of undecided senators from each party who have about two weeks to decide how they will vote on Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Several Democrats running for re-election in Republican stronghold states won by President Donald Trump are facing tough political choices ahead of the midterm election: Vote for Kavanaugh and upset their base Democratic voters, possibly dampening turnout in November, or vote against the judge and risk angering Trump supporters in their states who might otherwise vote for them. For now, they aren\u2019t saying how they will vote, but it\u2019s notable that they haven\u2019t come out against him, as so many of their Democratic colleagues have done. Asked Wednesday if she had seen any red flags about Kavanaugh, North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said, \u201cnot that I\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d But she said she is still \u201creviewing his record.\u201d Sen. Joe Donnelly, an Indiana Democrat up for re-election this year, also declined to say how he will vote. \u201cI\u2019m still reviewing everything at this point,\u201d he said. Another undecided Democrat, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, said he wants to review the confirmation hearings transcript and meet in-person with Kavanaugh soon to \u201cset the record straight\u201d on some issues. Tester said he has concerns about Kavanaugh\u2019s record on abortion rights, security and campaign finance. In the wake of Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious confirmation hearings last week, outside liberal groups including those who fear Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation could lead to an overturning of Roe vs. Wade are ratcheting up pressure on Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine \u2013 both seen as potential swing votes in the nomination because they are pro-abortion rights \u2013 with some attacks on Collins growing increasingly hostile, according to her staff. In recent days, Collins\u2019s office has reported an increase in vulgar messages being directed at the senator and her staff. Several GOP senators blasted the liberal groups for targeting Collins. \u201cThe increasingly aggressive behavior being employed by liberal activists and opponents of Judge Kavanaugh is extremely concerning. Targeting members in such a personal and hostile way has no place in public discourse, and Senator Schumer\u2019s continued silence sends a dangerous message to the Senate and country,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Senator Schumer to make clear where he stands and disavow the mob rule of the radical Left.\u201d Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a member of the Judiciary Committee and the most senior Republican in the Senate, predicted the campaign against Collins wouldn\u2019t work and she would vote for the judge. \u201cShe knows he\u2019s a class act and a reasonable guy,\u201d said Hatch who also said he expects Kavanaugh to be confirmed when a vote is expected during the last week of September. A crowdfunding campaign has also threatened to fund a challenger against Collins if she votes for Kavanaugh. \u201cBribery will not work on Senator Collins,\u201d said Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for Collins. \u201cExtortion will not work on Senator Collins. And anybody who thinks these tactics would work on Senator Collins obviously doesn\u2019t know her. This crowdedfunded money to pressure her is based on a quid pro quo \u2013 you vote the way we want and we will keep more than a million dollars away from your opponent \u2013 vote against us and we give her the money. It is basically a bribe.  Senator Collins will make up her mind based on the merits of the nomination. Threats or other attempts to bully her will not play a factor in her decision making whatsoever.\u201d While Murkowski and Collins as well as three red state Democrats \u2013 Heitkamp, Donnelly and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 voted to advance Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court pick,  the pressure from the liberal base has only intensified with Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. If all Republicans vote for Kavanaugh, they can clear him without Democrat support. It\u2019s not clear when the closely-watched bipartisan groups of senators will announce their decisions. It\u2019s possible the Democrats, if any are going to support Kavanaugh, would hold off until after the Republicans announce they are backing him, so to avoid being tagged as the deciding vote in his favor and potentially angering liberal voters.",

Susan Collins on Wednesday from liberal protesters pushing the the Maine senator to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Collins told The Wall Street Journal in an editorial published Tuesday that the attacks, which includes phone calls, from protestors have been profane. \u201cIn one case \u2013 and we are going to turn this over to the police, but unfortunately, of course, the person didn\u2019t leave a name or number \u2013 but they actually threatened to rape one of my young female staffers,\u201d she said of the attacks. Cornyn wasn\u2019t the only senator to defend Collins. GOP Sens.

Cruz later quote-tweeted Hatch and said: \u201cThe harassment campaign from the far Left against Susan Collins\u2014including threats of sexual violence against her staffers and potential illegal bribery\u2014is truly shameful, and shows the desperation of the radicals to try to stop the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.

As of Wednesday, 40,908 have pledged $1,138,067 on the website. The groups note on the platform that if Collins votes no for Kavanaugh, none of the money they\u2019ve raised will be collected to use against her opponent. But if she votes yes for Kavanaugh, the money will go toward whoever she faces in a reelection bid. \u201cIf you fail to stand up for the people of Maine and for Americans across the country, every dollar donated to this campaign will go to your eventual Democratic opponent in 2020.  We will get you out of office,\u201d the page states.

            "article_content": "Brett Kavanaugh spent much of 12 hours in a packed and raucous Senate hearing room Wednesday trying not to talk about politics \u2013 or how he would act in cases involving the man who nominated him to the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump.  Should the Senate confirm Kavanaugh, it would likely ensure a conservative majority for a generation and bolster Trump\u2019s legacy in reshaping the judiciary. But special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and other legal controversies surrounding the White House mean a Trump-specific case could hit the Supreme Court sooner rather than later. \u201cNo one is above the law in our constitutional system,\u201d Kavanaugh said, adding that the presidency is not a monarchy. But he refused to be drawn by Democrats into treacherous political areas. He declined to say if a sitting president must respond to a subpoena, and would not budge when asked whether a president could pardon himself. \u201cThe question of self pardons is something I have never analyzed, it is a question I have not written about, it\u2019s a question therefore that is a hypothetical question that I cannot begin to answer in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to Supreme Court,\u201d Kavanaugh said. Trump earlier this year claimed he had an \u201cabsolute\u201d right to pardon himself should he choose to. Senate Democrats have suggested that Kavanaugh could be biased in favor of the President and worry that his views on the primacy of executive power could help Trump evade legal scrutiny. When asked whether a sitting President should be forced to respond to a subpoena, Kavanaugh said, \u201cMy understanding is that you\u2019re asking me to give my view on a potential hypothetical, and that is something that each of the eight justices currently sitting on the Supreme Court, when they were sitting in my seat, declined to decide potential hypothetical cases.\u201d On whether he would recuse himself if an issue involving the President\u2019s criminal or civil liability came before the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh said: \u201cI should not and may not make a commitment.\u201d Kavanaugh also avoided a chance to discuss \u201cpolitical controversy\u201d when GOP Sen. Jeff Flake asked about Trump\u2019s recent tweet on the Justice Department prosecuting two Republican congressmen \u2013 both early Trump allies. Roe v Wade is 'precedent,' Kavanaugh says, but there's more to the future of abortion \u201cI don\u2019t think we want judges commenting on the latest political controversy, because that would ultimately lead the people to doubt whether we\u2019re independent or whether we\u2019re politicians in robes, and so maintaining that strict independence of the judiciary requires me, I think, to avoid commenting on any current events,\u201d Kavanaugh said. He repeated that sentiment just before 10 p.m. Wednesday night, when Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris asked about Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cboth sides\u201d were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville last year. \u201cI am not here to assess comments made in the political arena, because the risk is I\u2019ll be drawn into the political arena,\u201d Kavanaugh said. Over and over Wednesday, Kavanaugh, who was calm and disciplined during a long day of scrutiny from Democrats under pressure from grassroots activists to show vigorous resistance to Trump\u2019s nominee, argued that judges must be independent and must confine their rulings to precedent. On abortion, Kavanaugh said that he viewed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision upholding a woman\u2019s right to an abortion as settled precedent of the Supreme Court under the doctrine of stare decisis. Roe v. Wade is \u201centitled to respect\u201d he said, adding that he understands the passion around the decision. \u201cI don\u2019t live in a bubble. I understand. I live in the real world. I understand the importance of the issue,\u201d he said. Meet the protesters interrupting Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing But Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein raised doubts that a nominee\u2019s position would hold when it comes to ruling on abortion from the bench. \u201cWhen the subject comes up, the person says we will follow stare decisis, and then they get confirmed and they don\u2019t,\u201d she said of previous nominees. Feinstein also chose to drill down on gun control and school shootings, asking Kavanaugh to explain his dissent in a 2011 DC Circuit case upholding the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on the possession of most semi-automatic rifles. Kavanaugh argued that his reasoning was based on the Supreme Court\u2019s majority decision in the Heller case, a 2008 ruling authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, that held that semi-automatic rifles were constitutionally protected. While decrying gun violence and sympathizing with Feinstein\u2019s horror over school shootings, Kavanaugh said, \u201cI understand the issue, but as a judge, my job was to follow the Second Amendment opinion of the Supreme Court whether I agree with it or disagree with it.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s testimony was frequently interrupted by protestors who were led screaming out of the hearing room. But the proceedings lacked the bitterness and partisan sniping that characterized the opening day of the hearing on Tuesday. Democrats are under pressure to show their voters that they have the backbone to challenge the administration and also want to make clear to their voters the huge stakes of getting out to vote \u2013 since the GOP victory in 2016 gave Trump the chance to significantly tug the Supreme Court to the right, possibly for decades. The President himself said that he was pleased with Kavanaugh\u2019s performance so far, saying he was \u201cborn for the position.\u201d \u201cI watched today for a little while. I saw some incredible answers to some very complex questions,\u201d Trump told reporters. In order to stop Kavanaugh from being confirmed, Democrats must keep their entire coalition together in the Senate and hope to pick off two Republicans, with the most likely options being Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins of Maine. Senators signal Kavanaugh appears on solid ground to win confirmation But there is also the chance that some Democrats, facing tough re-election races in states that Trump won handsomely in 2016, will be forced by their own hopes of political survival to vote for Kavanaugh. One potential Democratic defector, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, told CNN that he has so far seen nothing disqualifying in the nominee\u2019s testimony. \u201cHe\u2019s handled himself very professionally. \u2026 His dialogue is more specific in his approach to being a jurist,\u201d Manchin said, adding that he felt the behavior of Republican and Democratic senators in the hearing had been deplorable. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes people sick,\u201d he said. Republicans, meanwhile, remain confident. Kavanaugh has not only testified twice before, he worked on judicial nominations while serving in the George W. Bush White House. He understands the process better than most. He\u2019s been participating in \u201cmurder boards\u201d \u2013 practice sessions \u2013 with clerks and Justice Department lawyers taking on the roles of senators, according to a participant. The hearing will resume at 9:30 a.m. Thursday with another round of questions from senators.

            "article_content": "Two Democratic senators weighing 2020 presidential bids are set to have a high-stakes tryout Wednesday in the confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey are both on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which means they\u2019ll get their chances to grill Kavanaugh as senators begin asking him questions Wednesday. RELATED: Partisan shouting marks first day of Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearing They\u2019ve been at the forefront of the broad Democratic opposition to the nominee, both trying Tuesday to delay the confirmation hearing with complaints that reams of Kavanaugh documents had not yet been examined. They also sent emails to their fundraising lists highlighting their opposition. Harris, in her email, called Kavanaugh an ideologue \u201chand picked by special interest groups because of his opposition to Roe v. Wade,\u201d the 1973 decision that legalized abortion. Booker\u2019s email cast Kavanaugh as a threat to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Trump. \u201cPresident Trump should not be able to handpick a judge who could effectively serve as his \u2018get-out-of-jail free\u2019 card,\u201d he said. Their opposition is unlikely to slow Kavanaugh\u2019s march to confirmation. Republicans have 51 votes in the Senate, meaning the GOP can afford to lose one vote and still confirm Kavanaugh, with Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie. So far, no Republicans have broken ranks. Capitol Police arrest 70 on first day of Kavanaugh hearings But it is an opportunity to demonstrate their styles and show how they would confront Trump\u2019s administration just months before high-profile Democrats are expected to begin launching their 2020 campaigns. Harris and Booker have traveled and fundraised extensively during this year\u2019s midterm election campaigns, laying the groundwork for presidential bids. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, chided ambitious Democrats for casting Kavanaugh as fulfilling a Trump anti-abortion litmus test, pointing to Hillary Clinton saying she\u2019d choose Supreme Court justices who would uphold Roe v. Wade. \u201cAnyone running for President over there, I dare you to disagree with her. You will wind up like I did, getting 1%,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou can\u2019t lose the election and pick judges,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIf you want to pick judges, you better win.\u201d The confirmation hearing \u2013 with Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, another possible 2020 contender, also among the Democratic committee members \u2013 is likely to showcase their different styles. Harris, in particular, has won praise from progressives for her sharp questioning of Trump appointees in previous hearings. How Democrats coordinated a tense start to Kavanaugh hearing The former California attorney general is the last member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask questions in hearings, as its most junior member. That gives Harris, who prepares extensively for the hearings, an opportunity to identify questions she believes the person testifying hasn\u2019t sufficiently answered \u2013 and then pounce, serving as the closer for Democrats. That\u2019s what happened with Gina Haspel, Trump\u2019s CIA director, in her May confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which Harris is also a member. In the hearing, Harris asked Haspel whether the President George W. Bush-era techniques for interrogating terrorism suspects, like waterboarding, were immoral, and Haspel deflected. \u201cAnswer yes or no,\u201d Harris shot back. She interrupted when Haspel tried to dodge the question. \u201cPlease answer, yes or no: Do you believe in hindsight that those techniques were immoral?\u201d Haspel deflected again, and Harris said, \u201cWill you please answer the question?\u201d When Haspel said, \u201cSenator, I think I\u2019ve answered the question,\u201d Harris responded, \u201cNo, you\u2019ve not.\u201d The definitive ranking of 2020 Democrats Later, Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, alluded to Harris\u2019 line of questioning when he announced his opposition to Haspel\u2019s nomination, saying, \u201cHer refusal to acknowledge torture\u2019s immorality is disqualifying.\u201d Stylistically, Booker tends to ask longer, bigger-picture questions than Harris does, though he\u2019s been part of key moments as well. One such moment came in January, when he told Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that her \u201csilence and \u2026 amnesia is complicity\u201d when she denied hearing Trump refer to \u201cs***hole countries\u201d in a private meeting. Even more prominently, in January 2017, Booker testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, before he became a member of that panel, against Jeff Sessions\u2019 nomination for attorney general. \u201cSen. Sessions has not demonstrated a commitment to a central requisite of the job: to aggressively pursue the congressional mandate of civil rights, equal rights and justice for all of our citizens,\u201d Booker said then.",

            "article_content": "Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court pick who could tilt American jurisprudence to the right for a generation, vowed to be neutral and impartial, shrugging off bitter Democratic demands for him to stall his own confirmation hearing until questions about his past are fully answered.  President Donald Trump\u2019s second pick for the nation\u2019s highest court sat silently for much of the day as Democrats staged an aggressive, coordinated effort to slow his apparent march to confirmation \u2013 in exchanges that highlighted several potential 2020 presidential contenders, including California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. In addition, Capitol Police said they made 70 arrests Tuesday for protests during the hearing and in other parts of Capitol Hill. After seven hours of political sparring mostly aimed by senators at their constituencies outside the hearing room, Kavanaugh finally got the chance to speak, and delivered emotional tributes to members of his family and his friends \u2013 but resolved none of the issues that Democrats say should derail his nomination. In a comment that seemed to fly in the face of a day of political estrangement, he warned that the Supreme Court \u201cmust never be viewed as a partisan institution\u201d and argued that \u201ca good judge must be an umpire \u2013 a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy.\u201d Democrats angrily accused the White House and Republicans of hiding key details about Kavanaugh\u2019s time as a Bush-era White House lawyer by refusing to publicly release tens of thousands of documents. They also decried a dump of 42,000 documents on Monday night, hours before the hearing. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, put the issue directly to Kavanaugh: \u201cFor the sake of this nation, for the sanctity of the Constitution that we both honor, step up, ask this meeting, this gathering to suspend until all the documents of your public career are there for the American people to see.\u201d How Democrats coordinated a tense start to Kavanaugh hearing Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nominee, is poised to succeed swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, the conservative-centrist who joined with liberals in some key decisions to uphold abortion rights. Kennedy was also the decisive vote for same-sex marriage and university affirmative action. Trump, watching the hearings from the White House, lashed out at Democrats for attacking Kavanaugh, whose arrival on the Supreme Court bench would represent a historic triumph for the President. \u201cThe Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is. They will say anything, and are only\u2026.looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see!\u201d Trump tweeted. His hardball language contrasted with the optimistic cadence of the closing remarks from Kavanaugh, who likely faces an even more contentious day when senators begin to ply him with questions on Wednesday. \u201cI live on the sunny side of the mountain,\u201d Kavanaugh said. The hearing opened with an hour of squabbling between Democrats and Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, that was punctuated by screaming protests from the public gallery as anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators were bundled out by Capitol Police. The theatrics reflect the impotence of Democrats who lack the votes in the Senate to block Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. It is not even certain all Democrats will stick together since endangered liberal senators up for re-election in red states are under intense pressure to back the confirmation. Father of slain Parkland student approaches Kavanaugh at hearing The clashes in the hearing were part of a long awaited political spectacle. But consistent with the uproar of the Trump era, Kavanaugh was upstaged even before he delivered his opening statement, as stunning revelations began to emerge of a new book by veteran reporter Bob Woodward that portrays Trump as a grave threat to national security and raging and incompetent. \u201cWhat are we trying to hide, why are we rushing?\u201d Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy asked as the hearing began. But Grassley denied Democratic attempts to get a vote in the committee on whether to adjourn the hearing, and complaints that the late arrival of the documents and other controversies flew in the face of committee rules and basic fairness. \u201cThis is something I have never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations. I was interrupted before I got a chance to say the agenda for today,\u201d said Grassley. Republican Sen John Cornyn of Texas complained the hearing was being overtaken by \u201cmob rule\u201d His colleague Orrin Hatch from Utah demanded that a \u201cloudmouth\u201d protester who was drowning out his remarks should be removed. Kavanaugh watched the arguments in the committee with a bemused look on his face, with his pen poised over a white legal pad. When the hearing turned from controversy over process to substance, Durbin thrust home the meat of the Democratic case. \u201cYou are the nominee of President Donald John Trump. This is a President who has shown us consistently that he is contemptuous of the rule of law,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cIt\u2019s that President who has decided you are his man.\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s use of the umpire analogy to refer to the duties of a judge recalled Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 confirmation hearing back in 2005, when he said his \u201cjob is to call balls and strikes and not to pitch or bat.\u201d He also praised Kennedy, who announced his retirement earlier this summer. \u201cAs Justice Kennedy showed us, a judge must be independent, not swayed by public pressure. Our independent Judiciary is the crown jewel of our Constitutional republic\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cIf confirmed to the Supreme Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States.  I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine.\u201d READ: Brett Kavanaugh's opening statement to Senate Judiciary Committee Kavanaugh, currently a circuit judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, also praised his colleague Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee, as a \u201csuperb chief judge.\u201d The hearing will continue Wednesday morning with questions from senators.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump couldn\u2019t wait to launch into the fall political season, an intense 10-week conflagration that marks a hugely consequential chapter in his turbulent presidency. He spent Labor Day, when campaign politicking goes into overdrive, unleashing a raging tweet storm blasting his beleaguered Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other favorite targets, such as fired FBI Director James Comey, officials leading the Russian probe and the media. But the critical period that might lay the foundations for the nation\u2019s ideological course for years and even decades to come will truly get underway on Tuesday morning when confirmation hearings start for Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh. The likely confirmation of Kavanaugh will drag the court to the right and make an ardent conservative, Chief Justice John Roberts, the bench\u2019s swing vote. It is a scenario that may take several Democratic presidencies to undo, could supercharge conservative voters and will on its own elevate the Trump presidency to undeniable historic significance. Brett Kavanaugh in his own words: The CNN interviews The battle that unfolds in Room 216 of the Hart Senate Office Building will also juice the fight between the parties before November\u2019s midterm elections \u2013 the culmination of weeks of political combat that could have grave implications for the Trump presidency itself. The elections, for the entire House of Representatives, one third of the Senate and a clutch of critical gubernatorial and statehouse races, will mark the first time a nationwide electorate has had the chance to cast judgment on Trump\u2019s tumultuous impact as the 45th president. If history is any guide, Trump could be slammed by a corrective wave building since his 2016 election triumph that sweeps Democrats to significant gains, including the possible capture of the House. This would be a nightmare scenario for Trump, since it could tighten a vise of investigations around his White House or even lead to impeachment hearings. But if the President drives his fabled political base to the polls in sufficient numbers to save the House he would surely interpret his triumph as validation of his tempestuous style and emerge more powerful and even less constrained than ever before. In between the Kavanaugh hearings and the midterms, a succession of challenges loom, from the Mueller investigation to the stuttering effort to force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, that will have considerable implications for Trump and the rest of the world. Trump blasts Sessions over indictments of two of his earliest congressional supporters Everyone else might have been enjoying the last long weekend of summer on Monday. But for Trump, there is no off season for attack politics. After aborting an apparent trip to play golf on a steamy Monday afternoon, he set off on a Twitter tear against some of his favorite targets. First, he lambasted Sessions, this time over corruption indictments laid against Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York, the first two House members to endorse him. \u201cTwo easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff\u2026.,\u201d Trump tweeted. Two long running, Obama era, investigations of  two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff...... The intervention held a mirror up to Trump\u2019s mood and nature: It revealed his nervousness about the midterms and his disdain for the traditional firewall between the White House and the Justice Department, meant to guard against the politicization of the law. It again hinted at the thin ice under Sessions, who Trump appears to believe should be acting as his own personal protector and lawyer rather than as an independent guardian of justice. Several Republican senators appear to have softened their support for Sessions in recent weeks, sparking speculation that the President could dismiss him after the midterm elections, a period that could be especially volatile if Democrats win the House. Trump told Bloomberg Sessions\u2019 job was safe at least until then. Some Trump critics fear that the President could dispense with Sessions, who is recused from the Russia investigation, in order to get an attorney general that could frustrate it or even prevent the public release of any final report that Mueller chooses to write. It remains unclear however whether the President could get a nominee with such an agenda through Senate confirmation. Trump on Monday also seized on a more positive aspect of his midterm election message, the strength of the economy, at the start of the week that will include the latest jobs report from his government. \u201cThe U.S. is respected again!\u201d Trump wrote, as he retweeted a message from his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, from which GOP leaders would love him never to deviate. \u201cOur economy is booming, millions are working again, and our country is back on the right track thanks to President @realDonaldTrump\u2019s policies. Happy Labor Day!\u201d Sanders wrote. Our economy is booming, millions are working again, and our country is back on the right track thanks to President @realDonaldTrump\u2019s policies. Happy Labor Day! Robust economic growth and low unemployment constitute the best incentive Republicans can put before voters this fall. But there is also an argument to be made that Trump\u2019s approval ratings \u2013 he dipped to just 36% in one recent poll -- should be far higher given current prosperity. The fact they are not could be a warning sign that Trump\u2019s disinclination to reach out to voters that do not already support him could help doom many Republican lawmakers come November. Papadopoulos says Sessions supported Putin campaign meeting, asks for most lenient sentence Another dark cloud hanging over the midterm elections is the Russia investigation. Washington is waiting to see whether special counsel Robert Mueller will make any significant moves in the intensely political period ahead or whether he will choose to try to insulate his prosecutors from Republican accusations of trying to influence voters. The White House has given every sign that it would welcome a campaign season clash with Mueller as a way to fan scare talk of impeachment that could convince any wavering Trump voters that their champion needs their support at the polls. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has promised to put out his own report debunking notions of Russian collusion or obstruction of justice. Trump must also worry about widening legal complications from the guilty plea lodged by his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen in a tax and fraud case in which prosecutors also granted immunity to the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. His worries on this score may intersect with the Kavanaugh hearings since a debate is expected on the extent to which the President should be exposed to legal scrutiny while in office. Despite being an aggressive member of independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s team during the Lewinsky scandal that led to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, Kavanaugh now appears to believe that Congress should shield sitting presidents from civil and criminal cases and takes a sweeping view of executive power. He is likely to face calls from Democrats to recuse himself from any such cases that make it to the Supreme Court. Though the Republican majority in the Senate and the demise of the filibuster rule for Supreme Court nominees means Kavanaugh is likely to be confirmed, both parties will use this week\u2019s confirmation hearings to engage their most committed activists before the midterms. Republicans will effectively be making good on a bargain that Trump made with evangelical voters \u2013 an important part of his coalition that has held firm despite questions over his conduct and character \u2013 following his vow to anoint authentic conservatives to the Supreme Court. Democrats are likely to use the hearings to build on fears among liberals that the right to have an abortion could be at risk from the new Supreme Court\u2019s conservative lurch \u2013 a factor that could send moderate voters flocking to the polls in November. Trump will be sure to capitalize on the Kavanaugh hearing when he kicks his midterm campaign into a higher gear at the end of the week, with visits to Montana and North and South Dakota. Before then, his administration is braced for the resumption of trade talks with Canada, following his warning to exclude the US ally and top export market from the new iteration of the North American Free Trade Agreement that he put at the center of his 2016 campaign.",

            "article_content": "After serving as a deputy to Ken Starr, Brett Kavanaugh went into private practice. During that time he spoke to CNN on a range of topics including abortion restrictions, judicial nominations and Bush v. Gore. In June 2000, Kavanaugh talked about a recently decided case that struck down a state ban on a procedure sometimes called partial birth abortion. Justice Anthony Kennedy, even though he had voted before to uphold Roe, was in dissent in this case. Kavanaugh noted how abortion, so many years after two landmark opinions, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey, still played such a central role at the court. Later on in the conversation about abortion restrictions, Kavanaugh nodded to the fact that Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, a Ronald Reagan nominee, had sided with the liberals in the case. Further, he suggested that presidents sometimes choose \u201cconsensus\u201d candidates instead of more conservative nominees who could raise a fight in Congress. His comments are interesting because they give insight to his thought process on judicial nominations just before he would enter the White House Counsel\u2019s Office and work at nominating more conservative judges. Kavanaugh also spoke broadly about the Supreme Court, suggesting that the court under Chief Justice William Rehnquist had not gone as far in overruling landmark opinions as conservatives might have hoped and expected when Rehqnuist became chief justice in 1986. For instance, in Dickerson v. United States, the court struck down an act of Congress that had attempted to narrow the scope of the Miranda rule in federal cases. Rehnquist wrote for the court that Miranda, as a constitutional ruling, could not be narrowed by Congress. Kavanaugh\u2019s comments on abortion restrictions and judicial nominations set the conservative tone that followed him the rest of his career. Along with dozens of other conservative lawyers, Kavanaugh volunteered to help George W. Bush during the 2000 election dispute that landed before the Supreme Court. After oral arguments in December, Kavanaugh did an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer trying to read the tea leaves during the argument. As a former clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy, he foreshadowed the fact that Kennedy was troubled by the arguments put forth by the Democrats.",

            "article_content": "Rising Democratic star Ayanna Pressley is testing whether her party is willing to cast aside its experienced and reliable veterans in favor of a new generation of leaders who argue they are more suited for politics in the Donald Trump era. Pressley, the 44-year-old who became Boston\u2019s first black female city councilor in 2009, is challenging 10-term incumbent Rep. Mike Capuano in the September 4 primary in one of the most heavily Democratic regions in the nation once represented in Congress by John F. Kennedy. It\u2019s an urban and diverse district winding through Boston, Somerville, Cambridge and other nearby towns. Some Democrats see Pressley as the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-style giant-slayer. But taking down the 66-year-old Capuano, who is one of the most progressive members of Congress, could be an even tougher task. Pressley\u2019s chances at victory depend on whether she can drive young people and minorities who she says have been forgotten in the district to the polls, despite state laws that make turning out new and infrequent voters difficult. And it will gauge whether the Democratic energy that has helped women win most contested primaries this year can be turned against an incumbent who hasn\u2019t broken with the left on any important votes. \u201cThis is a fight for the soul of our party. This is a fight for the future of our democracy,\u201d Pressley said at a recent canvassing event in Cambridge. \u201cWe might vote the same way but we will lead differently. These times require and this district deserves bold, activist leadership.\u201d Pressley has long been a Democratic star in the making. Her campaign slogan \u2013 \u201cChange Can\u2019t Wait\u201d \u2013 connects the Democratic optimism of the early Barack Obama years to the urgency of Trump\u2019s presidency. Pressley is a commanding stage presence who frequently ditches microphones; she doesn\u2019t need them. She talks openly about her father being incarcerated for much of her childhood and about being a rape victim. Her go-to line, that \u201cthe people closest to the pain should be closest to the power,\u201d explains her calls for change in a district where people of color now outnumber white people. Over late-night tacos at a Mexican restaurant after an event in Everett, Pressley said the district is among the nation\u2019s most uneven. \u201cThe systemic inequalities and disparities are worsening,\u201d she said.  That she\u2019d diversify Massachusetts\u2019 all-white, mostly male House delegation, she said, is \u201cthe bonus.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about who I listen to and it\u2019s about who I govern with. And there are a lot of people in this district who feel left out and left behind and ignored \u2013 and it\u2019s not just women, it\u2019s not just people of color,\u201d Pressley said. \u201cIt runs the gamut. And I think after a generation, the district deserves a choice.\u201d Thirty minutes later, Pressley watched as her campaign\u2019s first television commercial \u2013 a Spanish-language spot \u2013 played on Tacos El Paso\u2019s TV. One of the most telling clashes in the Capuano versus Pressley race so far has been over Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who triggered a national debate by kneeling during the National Anthem. In a town hall in Boston last year, Capuano took issue with Kaepernick\u2019s tactics. \u201cIt was the way he said it that turned off half of America, which I don\u2019t think is productive,\u201d Capuano said then. The issue was raised at the candidates\u2019 final debate, and Capuano stuck to his position that kneeling during the anthem \u201cdivided America.\u201d \u201cI thought that particular action divided America, because he chose to do it on the National Anthem,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cI understand what he\u2019s doing. I actually agree with the concept of what he\u2019s doing. I just thought it could have been done in a way that would have brung more people into the discussion, rather than actually anger an awful lot of America.\u201d Pressley, though, said she backed Kaepernick\u2019s concerns and his tactics, saying that police brutality toward black men \u201cstrikes at the soul and consciousness of this country, and this should be of consequence and concern to everyone.\u201d \u201cIt is necessary,\u201d she said, \u201cthat we are disruptive right now and making people uncomfortable.\u201d In the wake of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s stunning upset of the No. 4-ranking House Democrat, New York Rep. Joe Crowley, in June, Pressley was seen as the next potential challenger to take down a House Democratic incumbent \u2013 in part because, hours after her victory, Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to highlight Pressley and said: \u201cVote her in next, Massachusetts.\u201d But there are important differences in the two races. A factor that complicates Pressley\u2019s chances: Massachusetts\u2019 laws, like New York\u2019s, are far behind most Democratic pushes to expand voting access. In New York, those restrictive voting laws created an opening for Ocasio-Cortez to win a low-turnout affair in which most voters weren\u2019t paying attention. In Massachusetts, they make it tougher for Pressley to win what\u2019s likely to be a higher-turnout election that most Democrats are watching closely, but that low-propensity voters may be more likely to skip, since it takes place the day after Labor Day. Who's next? Progressive primary insurgents to watch Ocasio-Cortez was a 28-year-old political newcomer who shocked the political world in part because Crowley didn\u2019t take her challenge seriously enough. Pressley, though, is a well-known figure in Massachusetts politics: She worked for former Rep. Joe Kennedy II and former Sen. John Kerry before being elected to the Boston city council, and her congressional bid has drawn the endorsements of high-profile Democratic figures like Attorney General Maura Healey. Her higher profile has made for a different race: While Ocasio-Cortez largely flew under the radar outside progressive media, Pressley was endorsed by the Boston Globe. Knowing the threat Pressley poses, Capuano has prepared for a close race for months. His campaign has highlighted progressive positions like his early support for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d his opposition to the Iraq war, his opposition to the creation of ICE and his perfect scores from Democratic groups on issues like gun control and abortion rights. Pressley, meanwhile, has never identified a specific fireable offense from Capuano. Pressley, a Hillary Clinton surrogate who in 2016 warned about the cost of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d now supports single-payer health care. She wants to abolish ICE and has sworn off corporate PAC money. Capuano, meanwhile, has a long record of opposing war. But Pressley has never offered herself as a progressive insurgent taking on the moderate Democratic establishment. Pressley concedes that she and Capuano would likely cast the same votes \u2013 though she gives Capuano no credit for those votes, saying at a campaign stop in Cambridge that it\u2019s \u201cno profile in courage; that\u2019s baseline doing your job.\u201d Capuano, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who\u2019s been in office since 1999, wasn\u2019t eager to draw policy contrasts, either. Even after several debates, he said he has \u201cno idea\u201d how he\u2019s more progressive than Pressley, and declined to point to any key distinctions. \u201cMy opponent has an obligation to say what she would be doing differently,\u201d Capuano said in an interview on a recent Tuesday as he stood on a street corner outside S&S Deli in Cambridge holding signs with a nurses\u2019 union that endorsed him. He said Pressley \u201chasn\u2019t done that, except to say that she\u2019d do it differently.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d Capuano said. Capuano\u2019s campaign has the support of much of the state and national Democratic power structure \u2013 including Kennedy, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and civil rights icon Georgia Rep. John Lewis. He said Pressley is fundamentally misstating his record in Congress. He pointed to a series of projects \u2013 including $1 billion for a Green Line commuter rail project and other housing and rail efforts. \u201cThat\u2019s not a vote, that\u2019s advocacy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s getting things done in Washington.\u201d He also declined to address Pressley\u2019s argument that the district needs activist leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t have a response. I don\u2019t respond to generic comments like that, because there\u2019s nothing to respond to,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cI point to my record.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democratic senators facing tough races in Republican-leaning states are the target of a new ad from a Democratic group that pressures them to vote down President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court. In a new six-figure ad campaign, Demand Justice \u2013 a Democratic group aiming to sink Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination \u2013 will hit three red-state Democrats with ads urging them to vote against Kavanaugh because Republican pundits and television personalities have raised questions about his credentials and ties to the President\u2019s message. The ads, which will target Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia, will begin airing on Thursday. Donnelly, Heitkamp and Manchin are three of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018 and they all voted for Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch. All three also represent states Trump handily won in 2016 and their decision on Kavanaugh will be closely watched ahead of the November elections to see how they plan to run in the final weeks of the campaign. Two red state Democratic senators to meet with Trump's Supreme Court nominee \u201cMeet Brett Kavanaugh: Son of a Washington lobbyist, as a judge ruled for special interests, lived the high life in Washington,\u201d the narrator says in the piece. \u201cNo wonder conservatives are upset.\u201d The ad paints Kavanaugh as a Washington insider who is out of step with Trump\u2019s campaign promises. When the narrator says Kavanaugh has \u201clived the high life in Washington,\u201d the price tag of his $92,000-a-year membership to the Chevy Chase Club country club, outside Washington, flashes on the screen. The ad then pivots to the words of Republicans. \u201cA lot of the folks in the base really were sort of turned off to Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d says former Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican. \u201cHe is from Washington. He is the establishment pick.\u201d Ben Shapiro, the conservative commentator, then adds: \u201cI\u2019ve got problems with Kavanaugh in general. He\u2019s kind of the DC insider pick.\u201d Judge Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News analyst, is shown saying, \u201cThis person is at the heart and soul of the DC establishment.\u201d When a Fox News hosts asks the analyst whether Kavanaugh is a \u201cswamp pick\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington \u2013 Napolitano says yes. \u201cThese Republicans have it right,\u201d the narrator says before urging viewers to tell their respective senators to \u201coppose Kavanaugh for Supreme Court.\u201d Brian Fallon, Demand Justice\u2019s top operative, told CNN, \u201cIf (Kavanaugh) gets confirmed for the Supreme Court, he will be a reliable vote for special interests. This should not be considered a hard vote even for red-state Democrats.\u201d Heitkamp and Donnelly met with Kavanaugh on Wednesday. \u201cI want to get a sense of who he is as a person,\u201d Heitkamp told CNN before the meeting. \u201cThe single most important thing for me is somebody who approaches every case with a completely open mind.\u201d Democratic groups like Demand Justice have been worried that the party\u2019s long odds of stopping Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick could get longer if senators like Heitkamp back Kavanaugh, so the group has aired a series of ads pushing them to stay with the party. Demand Justice also has leaned on moderate Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska with ads urging them to protect abortion rights. \u201cIf Donald Trump has his way,\u201d says the narrator in an ad released earlier this year, \u201cthe next Supreme Court pick will turn the court against a woman\u2019s constitutional right to safe, legal abortion.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A key Republican senator said Monday he will support Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court. In a series of tweets Monday morning, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who had expressed some concerns about Kavanaugh\u2019s record related to privacy and the 4th Amendment, said he would vote for Kavanaugh. \u201cAfter meeting Judge Kavanaugh and reviewing his record, I have decided to support his nomination. No one will ever completely agree with a nominee (unless of course, you are the nominee). Each nominee however, must be judged on the totality of their views character and opinions,\u201d Paul said in one of those tweets. Kavanaugh's Obamacare rulings under microscope as he meets Manchin Paul followed up his initial comment with an entire series highlighting why he was backing Kavanaugh. \u201cI have expressed my concern over Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s record on warrantless bulk collection of data and how that might apply to very important privacy cases before the Supreme Court,\u201d Paul tweeted. \u201cIn reviewing his record on other privacy cases like Jones, and through my conversation with him, I have hope that in light of the new precedent in Carpenter v. United States, Judge Kavanaugh will be more open to a Fourth Amendment that protects digital records and property.\u201d Trump Supreme Court pick: I would \u2018put the nail\u2019 in ruling upholding independent counsel Paul also applauded Kavanaugh\u2019s record on the Second and First Amendments. \u201cHis strong defenses of the First and Second Amendments in landmark cases show someone who isn\u2019t afraid to challenge the status quo and will fight with backbone,\u201d Paul wrote, adding, \u201cJudge Kavanaugh will have my support and my vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court.\u201d Paul\u2019s decision to back Kavanaugh comes as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, works to try and hold his caucus together and keep moderate Democrats from coming out in support of the nominee before Republicans get the votes on their own. Republicans don\u2019t need Democratic votes to approve Kavanaugh, but with Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain back home fighting brain cancer, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can\u2019t afford to lose a single Republican vote without convincing Democrats to cross the aisle and vote for Kavanaugh. Whip list: Where senators stand on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh It\u2019s been nearly a month since Kavanaugh was nominated, and Monday will mark his first meeting with a Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who is facing re-election in a state President Donald Trump easily won. Meanwhile, all eyes are still on Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two key moderate votes. The senators were instrumental in stopping the repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 more commonly known as Obamacare \u2013 and have bucked their party in the past on issues related to abortion rights, two topics that are sure to come up in their meetings with Kavanaugh.",

            "article_content": "From party leaders to the progressive challengers trying to uproot them, there\u2019s at least one thing uniting most Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterms: When it comes to Russian election interference, let special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictments do the talking. Voters \u201care not asking me about Russian bots, OK,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat up for re-election in Minnesota this year, said at a liberal conference back in May. \u201cThey\u2019re asking me about soybean exports.\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, the speaker\u2019s gavel back in her sights, has offered up similar warnings and tried to quell calls from within her ranks for Trump\u2019s impeachment. Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, has also sought to steer the party\u2019s focus away from President Donald Trump and All Things Russia. For the most part, Democrats on the front lines this fall say they\u2019re on board, poised to keep their focus on bread and butter (and soy, at least in the Midwest) questions. But in weeks like this one, it\u2019s easy to see how that discipline \u2013 and the required balancing act \u2014 could fall apart. Trump Supreme Court pick: I would 'put the nail' in ruling upholding independent counsel Which brings us to Wednesday\u2019s news, as first reported by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, that Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \u201cexpressed his desire (in March 2016) to overturn a three-decade-old Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of an independent counsel.\u201d His remarks came during a discussion at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Asked to name a decision he thought should be ditched, Kavanaugh said he\u2019d like to the \u201cput the final nail\u201d in Morrison v. Olson, a 1988 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the constitutionality of a now-defunct federal statute creating independent counsels. Though the statute has expired, Kavanaugh\u2019s opinions on executive power \u2013 as heard at AEI and read, as an example, in the Minnesota Law Review \u2013 are concerning to Democrats worried about a potential Trump challenge to Justice Department regulations governing Mueller. It\u2019s worth noting two things here: Which bring us back to the fundamental thing: Whether Democrats can keep their focus on a potentially winning issue, like the future of Roe v. Wade, and avoid a partisan slap fight over Russia-adjacent questions \u2013 which, in turn, makes it a preview of how and if they might react to similar worries and temptations closer to Election Day. (Schumer and New Jersey\u2019s Sen. Cory Booker have already called for Kavanaugh to recuse himself, if confirmed, from any cases involving the Mueller investigation. It\u2019s unclear how much more energy they\u2019ll direct to the issue.) Like with midterm strategy, the consensus on the political left when it comes to Kavanaugh is actually pretty simple. There isn\u2019t much internal dissent. If Senate Democrats and activists can turn the hearings and vote into a referendum on abortion rights, the logic goes, they stand a sliver of a chance of blocking Kavanaugh\u2019s ascent. A partisan slap fight over Trump\u2019s legitimacy, on the other hand, is generally viewed as a losing proposition \u2013 particularly given the need to keep Democrats in lockstep opposition while bringing into the fold at least one Republican. Democrats have mapped out a road to (potential) victory, now and in November. The question now: Can they keep their hands on the wheel?",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump had a golden opportunity on Monday to stare down Russian President Vladimir Putin and tell him, in no uncertain terms, that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election was totally unacceptable, and that if anything like it continued going forward, there would be major and serious penalties to pay. Instead, standing next to Putin at the US-Russia summit in Helsinki, Trump did the opposite. \u201cI hold both countries responsible,\u201d Trump said in response to a question from the American press about Russia\u2019s interference. \u201cI think that the United States has been foolish. We\u2019ve all been foolish. We\u2019re all to blame.\u201d He went on to deride the FBI, special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, the US intelligence community, I mean, WHAT? W-H-A-T? Make no mistake what happened in Finland on Monday: An American President \u2013 contrary to the unanimous findings of his intelligence community and the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee \u2013 sought to split blame with a foreign adversary who actively interfered in an American election to help him and hurt his opponent. And he did so while standing next to the Russian President \u2013 a man who heads a country that not only sought to sway the 2016 election through interference but also invaded and annexed Crimea and allegedly poisoned a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil. It was the most stunning moment yet of a presidency filled with them. (On a domestic scale, his \u201cboth sides\u201d response to the racially motivated violence in Charlottesville was equally stunning, but Monday\u2019s summit sets a new bar for the global implications of Trump\u2019s actions.) Not only has Trump actively worked to realign geopolitics with his attacks on the European Union and NATO but, as of Monday, he made clear that he trusts Putin at least as much \u2013 and maybe more \u2013 than his own intelligence officials. Asked directly how he reconciled the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia had meddled in the election with Putin\u2019s denials, Trump punted \u2013 saying both sides made good points and believed their view strongly. Putin was \u201cextremely strong and powerful in his denials,\u201d said Trump. What clearer evidence could you ask for that Trump sees Putin as just as credible as the AMERICAN intelligence community? I mean, Putin denied he meddled in the election strongly. So we have to believe him, right? RIGHT??? Donald Trump sent the worst tweet of his presidency this morning It\u2019s impossible to accurately describe how remarkable that sort of equal footing is when it comes to recent US relations with Russia \u2013 particularly as seen from the Republican point of view. Prior to Trump\u2019s ascendancy, Republicans had spent the better part of the last four decades casting Russia as a savvy and dangerous enemy. Ronald Reagan famously described the Soviet Union as a bear \u2013 insisting that America needed to be as strong and powerful as Russia as quickly as possible. In the 2012 campaign, Mitt Romney, to some mockery from Democrats, said that Russia was America\u2019s No. 1 geopolitical foe. \u201cThere\u2019s no question but that in terms of geopolitics \u2013 I\u2019m talking about votes at the United Nations and actions of a geopolitical nature \u2013 Russia is the No. 1 adversary in that regard,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. The gulf between that sort of rhetoric and what we saw on Monday in Helsinki is as wide as the Grand Canyon. In fact, the difference between Trump\u2019s treatment of Russia and Putin and that of his party isn\u2019t even the stuff of an intraparty disagreement. It\u2019s a disagreement on fundamental principles. It\u2019s as though Donald Trump was pro-abortion rights and his party opposed abortion rights. Oh wait \u2026   The reaction, as you might expect, watching what can only be described as a jaw-dropping performance by the President of the United States was immediate and hugely critical. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of \u2018high crimes & misdemeanors,\u2019\u201d tweeted former CIA Director John Brennan. \u201cIt was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump\u2019s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???\u201d Former Illinois Republican congressman and conservative talk radio host Joe Walsh voiced a similar sentiment. \u201cThis press conference is an absolute disgrace,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cTrump won\u2019t even side with America. What Trump did today was commit treason. He cannot be supported anymore. He is a clear & present danger to America. Republicans can no longer be quiet. I won\u2019t be quiet. I am done with him.\u201d There may be a tendency in some circles \u2013 primarily occupied by Trump allies who believe whatever he says \u2013 to cast the sorts of reactions from Brennan and Walsh as just the carping of losers, people who disagree with Trump or who he beat. Sore losers. Haters. Libruls. Don\u2019t fall for it. Trump\u2019s decision to throw over the conclusions of his intelligence community (and the Senate Intelligence Committee) because Putin says he didn\u2019t meddle in the election has ZERO to do with partisanship. This isn\u2019t about Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s about Americans and Russians. Or maybe more accurately, it\u2019s about western democracy versus a Russian leader who has made destabilizing the West a long-term goal of his. Why is President Trump unable or unwilling to see that reality? Yes, there is the possibility that the Russians have something compromising on him, something he is so embarrassed about that he is willing to ignore the clear and present danger posed by Russia to keep it from going public. Putin denied the existence of any sort of \u201ckompromat\u201d on Trump in the news conference Monday, arguing that he didn\u2019t even know Trump was in Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013. To which I would say: Ask yourself if a former KGB official who is now the president would be unaware of someone as wealthy and high-profile as Trump being in his country. I mean, come on. Unless and until we find out about whether \u201ckompromat\u201d on Trump actually exists \u2013 and what the compromising information is \u2013 I think the clear motivation for Trump\u2019s stunning performance on Monday is his total and complete inability to see beyond his own self-interest. In Trump\u2019s mind, any talk of Russian interference in the election is an attempt to undermine the \u201cbrilliant campaign\u201d (his words) he ran in 2016 and somehow invalidate his victory. Why else would Trump launch into an extended riff about his Electoral College margin in front of the President of Russia and almost two years removed from that election? What does Putin care how many electoral votes Trump won? And what difference does it makes anyway? Trump is President. He won. The end. Conservative pundit Brit Hume summed up Trump\u2019s remarkable blindness to anything beyond his own nose in this tweet: \u201cBecause Trump is unable to see past himself, he sees the Russia meddling investigation as only about him and the collusion claim, and thus calls it a witch hunt. But the investigations are much more about what Russia did, as the House and Senate reports long since established.\u201d Not everything in the world is about Donald Trump. Attempting to get to the bottom of the meddling of a foreign power in a US presidential election isn\u2019t about trying to hurt Trump. It\u2019s way, way, way bigger than that. It\u2019s about trying to protect democracy from those who would tear it down from the inside out. A President who can\u2019t or won\u2019t see that is someone who is actively dangerous not only to the United States but to the world.",

            "article_content": "Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont will have a busy next 72 hours as he dives into the Supreme Court fight while stumping for four 2018 candidates in three states. He rallied with Rep. Keith Ellison, now a candidate for attorney general in Minnesota, on Friday morning and again in the afternoon. On Saturday he\u2019s in Wisconsin alongside Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who\u2019s up for re-election in the fall, and later on, Randy Bryce, a Democratic primary candidate looking to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan in the state\u2019s 1st District. Sanders wraps the weekend in Pennsylvania on Sunday, with a morning speech at the American Federation of Teachers convention and afternoon rally with Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. (Ahead of his trip to western Pennsylvania, Sanders in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised Summer Lee and Sara Innamorato, a pair of Democratic Socialists of America-backed state House candidates who won primaries against incumbent Democrats, calling their campaigns \u201creally quite incredible.\u201d) The swing is reminiscent of Sanders\u2019 travels during the 2017 Obamacare fight. This time, though, it\u2019s about defeating the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh while elevating Democrats ahead of the fall and, Sanders hopes, merging the two issues in the process. These are all states that could be important in the 2020 Democratic primary and general election. President Donald Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and only narrowly lost in Minnesota. Sanders now hits them all alongside colleagues and candidates who largely share his politics. Monday means it\u2019s back to Washington, but the show only ramps up from there. Sanders will host a town hall event on Capitol Hill that will feature workers from a bunch of major, super-rich American companies \u2013 to talk about how they\u2019ve been treated (not well, they say) by their corporate bosses, who were invited to join. The event will be livestreamed, like others Sanders has done, pulling in millions of viewers, by a combination of progressive activist groups and media outlets. \u2014 This weekend, Monday and Tuesday, several prospective 2020 Democrats are slated to speak at the NAACP National Convention in San Antonio. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick will keynote the Clarence Mitchell, Jr., Memorial Luncheon on Monday, and the Civic Engagement Workshop on Tuesday will feature activist and philanthropist Tom Steyer. Finally, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro will deliver the keynote address at the closing plenary session. \u2014 While he\u2019s in Texas, Patrick will campaign with congressional hopeful Colin Allred on Sunday and meet with Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke on Monday, CNN\u2019s Terence Burlij notes. \u2014 On Friday, former Vice President Joe Biden will head to Phoenix to headline a fundraiser for Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat running for retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s seat. \u2014 None of the 2020 Democratic prospects are booked this week. HARRIS AND BOOKER VS. KAVANAUGH: Two 2020 Democratic prospects, Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, are preparing for an elevated role in the progressive opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Both are on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which positions them to grill Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearing. Harris is focusing on abortion rights and health care, while Booker is so far arguing that Trump shouldn\u2019t be able to appoint a justice while under investigation. Here\u2019s Eric\u2019s story. RICHARDS\u2019 BIG CROWD IN DES MOINES: Cecile Richards, the former Planned Parenthood president, drew a crowd of 250 at the annual Polk County Democratic Party Women\u2019s Event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday night. Polk County Chairman Sean Bagniewski tweeted that it was the largest crowd in the event\u2019s 18-year history. \u201cAnd everyone here wants her to run for something,\u201d he said. GARCETTI TALKS 2020: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti made news in an interview with CNN\u2019s Van Jones set to air Saturday at 7 p.m. ET on \u201cThe Van Jones Show.\u201d Here\u2019s his answer on whether he\u2019s running for president: \u201cI have no idea. I really don\u2019t. I mean, I have to talk with family.\u201d But the rest of Garcetti\u2019s answer is more revealing. Watch him name-drop two of the first four states to vote in the nominating process: \u201cBut I\u2019m exploring and looking at America and realizing when I go to a place like Iowa, the number one wind state in America with the number one solar city in America, that should bring us together. Jobs in the green economy, as you know, don\u2019t just exist in the coastal areas. When I talk to folks that are in South Carolina, they say it\u2019s still not where we need to be in terms of civil rights and police and community relations. As a mayor, I think I can bring something to that conversation.\u201d LANDRIEU\u2019S UNCERTAINTY: Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu sat down with Hill.TV this week and discussed his political future now that he\u2019s no longer in office. When asked about potentially running in 2020, he said he doesn\u2019t intend to run for president. \u201cI want a little time to think and get some perspective on life and just see where the future takes me, but it\u2019s not my intention right now to do that,\u201d Landrieu said. 2020 RNC IN CHARLOTTE? According to The Wall Street Journal, the Republican National Committee is nearing a final agreement with the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, to host the 2020 Republican National Convention, moving away from Las Vegas, which was previously reported to be a top contender along with Charlotte. With a Republican President, it would be expected to be the site of the nomination of Donald Trump for a second term. Charlotte hosted the Democratic National Convention in 2012, when President Barack Obama was nominated for second term. The city\u2019s location within a battleground state makes it a highly coveted spot for a convention, which draws thousands of delegates and political operatives. KASICH NOT BACKING DOWN: Ohio Gov. John Kasich is still playing coy about his political aspirations. The term-limited governor, who will leave office in January 2019, was asked again on Thursday during an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington if he will run for president again. \u201cThe Lord is largely going to determine my future, and I don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI have no clue what I\u2019m going to do, and I mean it sincerely.\u201d Kasich spent time at the event criticizing Trump\u2019s foreign policy and trade agreements, saying the administration has used a \u201cwrecking ball strategy\u201d to dismantle the nation\u2019s trade and military alliances.",

            "article_content": "Complaining about the process or Republican tactics is a dead end for Democrats fighting to block Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation, Sen. Bernie Sanders argued on Thursday, as he prepared to hit the road and rally opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s second nominee in less than two years. \u201cThis is political,\u201d the Vermont independent, who caucuses with Senate Democrats and ran for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said in an interview. \u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about women\u2019s rights and you\u2019re concerned about health care, the environment, (you need to) understand that the majority of this Supreme Court is about is working for the wealthy and the powerful against the needs of ordinary Americans.\u201d But if the confirmation debate becomes an argument over manners or how Republicans maneuvered to get to this point, Sanders suggested, the public \u2013 which he believes is mostly detached from Supreme Court-related jousting \u2013 will switch off. RELATED: Whip list: Where senators stand on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \u201cThe point now is to make people understand the real-life consequences of these decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you frame it like that, you will be successful.\u201d With confirmation hearings creeping up faster than Democrats might hope, the party and its progressive allies \u2013 stung and, initially, frozen in the aftermath of the announcement that swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy would retire \u2013 are beginning to make clear their strategy to muddy up Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh stands to be more than just a reliable vote for the right It looks a lot like what they were doing this time last year. In the spring and summer of 2017, Democrats in Congress and progressive activists rallied opposition to the GOP plan to gut Obamacare, eventually creating enough of a backlash that, after months of protests, Republicans in the Senate fell short of delivering the long-promised overhaul. This is an election year, and Democratic senators facing GOP challengers in red states are no sure bet to oppose Kavanaugh. Still, Sanders said he was confident that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was committed to \u2013 and capable of \u2013 keeping the caucus united, citing the New Yorker\u2019s work during previous high-stakes, high-profile fights. \u201cHe has a surprisingly good record in that regard,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou would not have predicted that on the tax bill and the (Obamacare) effort that that was possible, to keep all Democrats together, and he did. That\u2019s a pretty good record.\u201d Defeating Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination would be an even more significant victory and \u2013 given what appears to be a unified Republican Senate majority \u2013 much less likely. Sanders will speak at a pair of rallies with Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who\u2019s now a candidate for state attorney general, on Friday before spending Saturday in Wisconsin with Sen. Tammy Baldwin and, that evening, House candidate Randy Bryce. Sanders will wind up the weekend in Pennsylvania at the American Federation of Teachers convention and an event with Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. Rosenstein asks prosecutors to assist with Kavanaugh document review As he stands alongside that handful of Democrats on the ballot this year, Sanders will argue that victory this summer, and in the fall midterms, will require a pointed argument against the political implications of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation \u2013 a focus on what it means for abortion rights, Obamacare and the dwindling prospect of campaign finance revisions. \u201cAnybody who thinks that (Kavanaugh) is some kind of objective guy who\u2019s going to come on and look at each of the cases objectively \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the situation today. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Donald Trump thinks,\u201d Sanders said, arguing that the traditional deference, the tap-dancing around the edges of the nominee\u2019s politics, would amount to surrender at this stage. \u201cTrump campaigned and said, among other things, I will appoint pro-life candidates and, in so many words, implied that he wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump lies a whole lot but on this one he is probably right.\u201d Kavanaugh, in his previous court rulings, has steered clear, if only just, of offering clear insight into his views about abortion, but experts generally rate him as more conservative than all but Justice Clarence Thomas among the court\u2019s current occupants.",

            "article_content": "Judge Brett Kavanaugh is more likely than not going to win Senate confirmation to join the Supreme Court. After all, most nominees to the Supreme Court win confirmation. And with at least 50 Republican senators able to vote, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick doesn\u2019t need to win a single Democratic vote. But is it possible Kavanaugh doesn\u2019t get confirmed? The answer to that question is yes. It\u2019s likely to happen only if the public turns against his confirmation, though, as they did with Robert Bork in 1987. Last year, I fine-tuned a model that tries to explain the factors behind how each lawmaker voted in Senate confirmations since Bork and then tries predicting how Supreme Court future confirmation votes will go. It came within one vote of correctly predicting how many votes Neil Gorsuch would get during his Senate vote. We shouldn\u2019t expect the model to be this good every time. Still it gives us a good idea of what to expect. The model looks at the ideology of each senator and nominee, how often each senator votes with his or her party on votes where at least 50% of Democrats vote one way and 50% of Republicans vote another, the party of each senator, the qualifications of the nominee, the president\u2019s popularity and the nominee\u2019s popularity. (No polling was done on Anthony Kennedy\u2019s popularity before his confirmation.) We already know or can estimate the values of most of these variables. Trump\u2019s approval rating is, for example, in the low 40s, and Kavanaugh is seen as a very conservative and a very well-qualified nominee. Whip list: Where senators stand on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh What we don\u2019t know is how the public is going to react to the nominee. I reran the model with the known variables and then plugged in different popularity ratings for Kavanaugh. The model suggests that the only way Kavanaugh goes down is if he ends up as unpopular as Trump. With a net favorability rating of between -10 and -15 percentage points, Kavanaugh would be predicted to get 49 votes. That\u2019s, of course, one short of the 50 he needs. In this scenario, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is the most moderate and has voted against her party most often, is projected as the Republican senator who\u2019d vote against Kavanaugh. It\u2019s not too difficult to imagine why this would occur. Given how Trump seems to manage to polarize nearly everything he touches, it seems at least somewhat possible that his Supreme Court nominee ends up as unpopular as he is. Furthermore, Democrats and liberal groups are likely to be more active during this confirmation process than during Gorsuch\u2019s. This could help rally the Democratic base and bring up some swing voters. Put another way, Kavanaugh needs to be unpopular enough that he won\u2019t be seen as an electoral liability for moderate Democratic senators to vote against. These include red state senators up for re-election such as Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. On the other end, Collins needs to feel electoral pressure to vote against Kavanaugh. Keep in mind, Democratic senators and liberal groups were able to pull off such a feat with the Bork nomination. Bork\u2019s net favorability ended up at -11 points nationally. Bork finished the nomination process so unpopular because Democrats and liberal groups went after him for his views on the Constitution, such as privacy and the right to an abortion. They also brought up his views on executive privilege, which could be the cornerstone of a Democratic argument against Kavanaugh. The obvious difficulty for Democrats is that it\u2019s unlikely Kavanaugh will end up as unpopular as Bork was or Trump is. Among those who form opinions of Supreme Court nominees, their feelings are usually positive. Kavanaugh wins confirmation under most realistic scenarios. If he has a net favorability rating equal to the average nominee since 1987, he\u2019d be expected to win somewhere in the area of 54 to 56 votes. Red-state Democrats will feel pressure to vote for Trump\u2019s nominee in this instance. Collins will feel safe going with her party. (Something she was more likely to do in 2017 than in any previous year of her Senate career.) Perhaps the most probable scenario is for Kavanaugh\u2019s net favorability rating to end equal to Gorsuch\u2019s. He\u2019d probably win somewhere between 51 and 53 votes in this case. Again, he\u2019d take all the Republicans and a few Democrats. Now, the model mis-predicts by four votes on average. So given the relatively close vote margins, it\u2019s conceivable that Kavanaugh wins confirmation even if he is really unpopular. He could also be voted down if he is relatively popular. Still the point remains: Democrats\u2019 best chance to sabotage the nomination is by making Kavanaugh disliked.",

            "article_content": "The party lines are set. Republicans want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court and Democratic leaders like Chuck Schumer are already mobilizing against Kavanaugh. With ailing Sen. John McCain not voting, neither party can afford to lose a vote from their side. And that will put some senators in a tough position as Democrats move to make Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination specifically about abortion rights. \u201cI believe if we can prove to the American people, which I believe is truly the case, that this nominee will lead to a court that repeals women\u2019s reproductive freedom, repeals ACA with its protections for pre-existing conditions, we will get a majority of the Senate to vote for it,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday on CBS. Alabama Sen. Doug Jones is a Democrat representing a red state, which probably has something to do with his open mind to Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. Jones said Sunday, before the nominee was revealed as Brett Kavanaugh, that he could vote either way. \u201cI don\u2019t think my role is to rubber stamp for the President, but it\u2019s also not an automatic knee-jerk no, either,\u201d Jones told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d before Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. While the majority in state Jones represents is likely to be very supportive of Kavanaugh, it\u2019s equally likely that those who voted Jones in to office in 2017 will be equally unsupportive. Take the issue of abortion, which was a key issue in Jones\u2019 upset victory and it\u2019s gearing up as a key issue in Kavanaugh\u2019s impending nomination. According to CNN\u2019s exit polling taken after the 2017 special election, more than half of Alabama voters in that special election (52%) said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. But the 42% who said that abortion should be legal in all or most cases overwhelmingly voted for Doug Jones \u2013 at 81%. But there\u2019s no doubt that a senator like Jones faces more pressure to support the President than other Democrats, as he\u2019s located in a strongly red state. The opposite is true of Republican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, a supporter of abortion rights who represents a mostly blue state \u2013 Maine is able to split its electoral college votes, with one district consistently blue and the second a battleground. Collins is considered a Republican who often works across the aisle and has voted with both Democrats and Republicans. She supported both Neil Gorsuch and President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees. She\u2019s also said she won\u2019t support a nominee who is \u201chostile\u201d toward Roe v. Wade. How Kavanaugh answers questions about that case and the legal precedent it created will be key to his confirmation. During confirmation to a lower court, he promised to be deferential to the precedent. On the Supreme Court he could help change it. Republicans and independents voted for Collins in her 2014 election in large majorities of 97% and 69%, respectively. Even four-in-10 Democrats supported her. But according to PRRI\u2019s American Values Atlas, in 2014, Maine had the 3rd highest support for legal abortion in the US \u2013 with 67% who said it should be legal in most or all cases, following New Hampshire (73%) and Vermont (69%). Sen. Bob Casey is the rare Democrat who opposes some abortion rights and who describes himself as \u201cpro-life,\u201d but he opposed Trump\u2019s nomination for a reason unrelated to abortion and before he knew it was Kavanaugh. Casey stated on Monday that he wouldn\u2019t support the nominee for the Supreme Court, according to the Pennsylvania lawmaker\u2019s office. He tweeted that his opposition to the nomination is largely fueled by anger about Trump choosing from a list Casey says was formulated by \u201cthe hard Right, who are funded by corporate America.\u201d Casey is up for re-election in the fall midterms, with every poll done between him and Republican Lou Barletta showing Casey with an advantage. In a Suffolk University poll of Pennsylvania, taken in June, 73% of those who plan to vote for Casey in his upcoming election said that they want their vote to change the direction that Trump is leading the nation. Sixteen percent said that their vote isn\u2019t relevant to Trump and his policies. Jon Tester is another Democratic incumbent senator running in a red state. CNN has rated the race as lean Democrat. Montana was about equivalent to the rest of the US\u2019s abortion views when asked in 2014 with 54% of Montanans saying abortion should be legal in some or all cases compared to 55% of the US at large. Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was re-elected in Alaska in 2016 with 45% of the vote for her third term in office. Murkowski is outwardly supportive of abortion rights and has voted to fund Planned Parenthood with Democrats in the past. Alaska is more for legal abortion than the US as a whole, in the 2014 PRRI Atlas, with 56% of respondents saying they support legal abortions. But Murkowski, unlike Collins, voted against both of Obama\u2019s nominees to the Court. This story has been updated to correct the percentage of Alaskans who support legal abortion.",

            "article_content": "Progressives are spoiling for a fight over the Supreme Court, and Democrats\u2019 2020 presidential prospects are eager to lead them into the battle. Two senators weighing presidential runs, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, are on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Already, the two are sharpening their cases against Kavanaugh. Harris will focus on how his confirmation could tip the court\u2019s balance against abortion rights and other progressive health care priorities, an aide said. \u201cThis is about replacing the authority of government \u2013 putting the government\u2019s authority ahead of the authority of a woman to make a decision about her own body and her future,\u201d Harris said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cSo if you are a young woman in America, or you care about a young woman in America, pay attention to this, because it will forever change your life.\u201d Booker, according to an aide, will argue that Trump shouldn\u2019t appoint a justice while under investigation over his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. And like Harris, he is playing up the stakes of the Supreme Court battle. \u201cI look forward to standing with my colleagues and all Americans in what will be the most important fight of our lifetimes. There\u2019ll be no greater,\u201d Booker said Tuesday at the same news conference as Harris, with other Senate Democrats on the steps of the Supreme Court. Though Democrats \u2013 egged on by an energized progressive base \u2013 are promising to fiercely oppose Kavanaugh, they have no real power to stop Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Republicans hold 51 seats in the Senate, enough to confirm a Supreme Court nominee without any Democratic votes. And three Democrats up for re-election this year in Republican-leaning states \u2013 Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 previously voted for Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation and are being courted by the White House as potentially votes for Kavanaugh, as well. Whip list: Where senators stand on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh The confirmation battle could serve, though, as a test run for prospective 2020 candidates to flex their rhetorical muscles and engage with the base in the early stages of the next presidential election. Harris, in particular, has won praise from progressives for her sharp questioning of Trump appointees in previous hearings. The former California attorney general is the last member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask questions in hearings. That gives Harris, who prepares extensively for the hearings, an opportunity to identify questions she believes the person testifying hasn\u2019t sufficiently answered \u2013 and then pounce, serving as the closer for Democrats. That\u2019s what happened with Gina Haspel, Trump\u2019s CIA director, in a May confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where Harris is also a member. In the hearing, Harris asked Haspel whether the George W. Bush-era techniques for interrogating terror suspects, like waterboarding, were immoral, and Haspel deflected. \u201cAnswer yes or no,\u201d Harris shot back. She interrupted again when Haspel tried to dodge the question. \u201cPlease answer, yes or no: Do you believe in hindsight that those techniques were immoral?\u201d When Haspel deflected again, Harris said, \u201cWill you please answer the question?\u201d And when Haspel said, \u201csenator, I think I\u2019ve answered the question,\u201d Harris responded, \u201cNo you\u2019ve not.\u201d Later, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain alluded to Harris\u2019 line of questioning when he announced his opposition to Haspel\u2019s nomination, saying, \u201cHer refusal to acknowledge torture\u2019s immorality is disqualifying.\u201d Harris\u2019 style also put her in the spotlight in June 2017, when twice in one week Republican members of the Intelligence Committee sought to interrupt her questioning of Trump\u2019s Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. In the Judiciary Committee in April, she also prompted Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg to contradict himself several times about why the company did not inform tens of millions of users in 2015 that their data had been improperly sold. For his part, Booker \u2013 who joined protesters on the steps of the Supreme Court on Monday night just after Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination was announced \u2013 has echoed activists\u2019 warnings that Kavanaugh could undercut Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act, but has focused primarily on arguing that Trump shouldn\u2019t appoint a Supreme Court justice while his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia are the subject of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u201cThe Senate should not move forward with this confirmation, should not go forward with advising and consenting on this individual until this prosecution, this criminal investigation, is done,\u201d Booker said Tuesday. \u201cAnd if we do go forward, then every Republican, every Democrat should join together with insisting that Kavanaugh recuse himself from any matter regarding this President that should come before the Supreme Court.\u201d Stylistically, Booker tends to ask longer, bigger-picture questions than Harris \u2013 though he\u2019s been part of key moments, as well. One such moment came in January, when he told Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen that her \u201csilence and your amnesia is complicity\u201d when she denied hearing Trump refer to \u201cs***hole countries\u201d in a private meeting. Even more prominently, in January 2017, Booker testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee before he became a member of that committee against Sessions\u2019 nomination for attorney general. \u201cSen. Sessions has not demonstrated a commitment to a central requisite of the job to aggressively pursue the congressional mandate of civil rights, equal rights and justice for all of our citizens,\u201d Booker said then. Another sometimes-mentioned 2020 presidential prospect, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, is also on the Judiciary Committee. She said Tuesday the Supreme Court makes decisions about \u201cabout who you can marry, about where you can work, about if you can vote, and in the case of my grandpa, who worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines his whole life, about if his workplace was safe.\u201d Klobuchar also warned of the potential for the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion everywhere to be undone if Kavanaugh is confirmed. \u201cWe cannot go back to a time when women are made criminals for making a choice about what to do with their own bodies. We cannot go back to a time when they can\u2019t make a decision about their own contraceptives,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you look at what\u2019s happening in this country, people want to move forward.\u201d",

Kavanaugh and Vice President Mike Pence met Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The meeting came at almost the same time that Senate Democrats held a rally against Kavanaugh in front of the Supreme Court, an event led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing in the coming weeks. Kavanaugh also met later Tuesday with the committee\u2019s chairman, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, for what Grassley described as a \u201cpleasant conversation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a thorough process. Hopefully it\u2019s efficient, we get it done quickly,\u201d he said, adding later, \u201cIn the end, I think his record will speak for itself.\u201d The pick of Kavanaugh announced Monday night immediately launched the highly polarized fight in the US Senate, testing both sides\u2019 ability to unify their ranks just months ahead of the hugely consequential midterm elections. With Republicans holding a 51-49 majority \u2013 and Sen. John McCain recovering from cancer treatment in Arizona and away from Washington since December \u2013 neither side appears to have any room to lose votes. Supreme Court Senate math: Meet the key senators to watch While the Senate\u2019s leaders have been outspoken, all eyes are on senators closer to the middle of the ideological spectrum. Republicans are targeting Democrats up for re-election in states President Donald Trump won in 2016 \u2013 of which there are 10, not including Sen. Doug Jones, who\u2019s not up for re-election this year but hails from ruby red Alabama. Democrats in turn hope to peel off some Republicans including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and/or Susan Collins of Maine, two senators who support abortion rights and have split with their party before on whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cNow is the time to demand a justice who will protect our health care, not strike it down,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday. \u201cNow is the time to demand a justice who recognizes a woman\u2019s personal liberty, a right to make her own health care choices, instead of one who will put the government between a woman and her doctor. Now is the time to fight for the freedoms and rights that all Americans deserve, and that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake with this Supreme Court nomination. Collins told reporters on Tuesday it\u2019s \u201cpremature to render a judgment\u201d on Kavanaugh and she said she wants to question him extensively about his record. Murkowski told CNN Tuesday that her vetting of the nominee will take weeks, not days, and says all senators need to do their \u201cdue diligence\u201d before deciding how to vote. \u201cI don\u2019t have an impression on Judge Kavanaugh as to where he may fall on the issue of abortion as well as the many other issues that I will weigh as we move forward with this process,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cSo again, that\u2019s why I think all of us need to be doing our due diligence.\u201d RELATED: Democratic senator leaves door slightly open to voting for Kavanaugh Democrats have sought to frame the Supreme Court fight in part about how a potential Justice Kavanaugh would rule on health care. Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat and a key swing vote, has repeatedly highlighted the issue of helping those with pre-existing health conditions, a class of health care recipient protected under the Affordable Care Act \u201cI got 800,000 people in jeopardy \u2026 I\u2019m going to look at all the findings and records he\u2019s ruled on,\u201d he said of Kavanaugh, adding \u201cthe more information, the better it\u2019s going to be\u201d when asked about releasing Kavanaugh\u2019s emails from when he worked in the Bush administration. Another vulnerable Democrat up for re-election \u2013 Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana \u2013 made similar comments Tuesday, saying whether pre-existing conditions can still be covered under Obamacare will be a \u201ccentral part of this nomination,\u201d noting that he supported the law and expanded coverage for his constituents.",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \u201can impressive nominee who is extremely well qualified.\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he \u201cwill oppose Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination with everything I have.\u201d So, there you go. The battle lines are set. Now settle in for a two-plus month battle on policy, precedent, the past, the future and, whether anyone likes it or not, a ton of midterm election politics. Senate fight for Kavanaugh's confirmation already in progress Bottom line: Brett Kavanaugh will make his first appearance on Capitol Hill on Tuesday in an official kick-off of sorts to his nomination process. But get comfortable \u2013 a lengthy slugfest defined by millions of dollars and enormous stakes awaits. Reality check: This fight will be nasty, and it won\u2019t be quick. Expect eight or nine weeks to pass before a vote, aides say, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 most, if not all, of the key senators in play not to announce where they stand until shortly before the vote itself. Reality check part 2: This is a very uphill climb for Democrats trying to block Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. They don\u2019t have the votes on their own, Kavanaugh isn\u2019t considered by Republicans to be outside their mainstream and vulnerable Democrats are in a very, very tough spot with this vote. As noted, there\u2019s a long way to go and given Kavanaugh\u2019s voluminous paper trail and the very real agitation (and activation) inside the Democratic based, the path is hardly clear and the fight Schumer is predicting \u2013 and fully planning to provide \u2013 is very, very real. Interesting to watch: Democrats are very focused on Kavanaugh\u2019s lengthy paper trail from his time in the Bush administration as staff secretary (McConnell, as we\u2019ve reported, was too). There is no shortage of potential Bush-era policies Democrats would love to attack (and think they win the debate on), but a big question may become: would a major focus on that distract from their key message of abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act? Republicans Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska: Collins complimented Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201cimpressive credentials,\u201d but both senators made clear the nomination would be subject to extensive review. Kavanaugh pick was scripted end to Trump's reality show Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky: Keep an eye on Paul in the weeks ahead. He said he\u2019d keep an \u201copen mind\u201d to Kavanaugh, but while everyone focuses on whether Democrats can or will seize on the nominee\u2019s role in the Bush administration, it\u2019s probably worthwhile to keep an eye on Paul, for whom privacy issues and detention policy have long been paramount. Democrats Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana: All three were invited to the White House for the announcement ceremony. All three said no. All three made clear they would partake in a lengthy examination of Kavanaugh\u2019s record before making any decision. Sens. Jon Tester of Montana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Doug Jones of Alabama and Bill Nelson of Florida: Tester, McCaskill and Nelson are considered the second-tier of red-state Democrats up for re-election in 2018 to keep an eye on. All voted against the Neil Gorsuch nomination, but was we\u2019ve noted, that doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. Jones hails from rock solid red Alabama and, while he isn\u2019t up for re-election in 2018, was also invited to the White House (he also declined) and is going to get a lot of focus from the administration, Republicans and aligned outside groups. None of these four closed to door to voting for Kavanaugh. Did anyone tip their hand in their statements last night: Of the above group? No. Key player Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley is the person to watch in the days ahead. Not only will the Iowa Republican and his staff guide Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination through the committee process, he\u2019ll also set the confirmation hearing date \u2013 something destined to become a partisan scheduling war. Democrat after Democrat came out in immediate opposition to Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination Monday night (Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania even came out in opposition before the nomination was announced). But there are a handful of Democrats widely expected to vote against the nomination who said they were concerned, but would take the time to go through Kavanaugh\u2019s record before making a final decision. This used to be the pro-forma standard for a Supreme Court nominee. But this position was immediately attacked by Democratic groups for not being resolute enough in opposition. If you needed an idea of how seriously the base and outside groups are going to pressure their own on this. Speaking of Schumer\u2019s fight, on the Senate floor before Kavanaugh was announced, Schumer explicitly stated \u201cstare decisis,\u201d or standing precedent, was no longer an adequate threshold for nominees \u2013 as has long been the case. Schumer\u2019s rationale is two-fold: This, Schumer said, means the nominee \u201chas an obligation to share their personal views\u201d on Roe vs. Wade and the Affordable Care Act. As one GOP aide put it bluntly, \u201cthere\u2019s a 0% chance\u201d Kavanaugh accedes to that new Schumer-imposed threshold. But this is a notable shift, both on this nomination and for those in the future. The flood of outside money designed to pressure senators on the fence started immediately Monday night. On both sides, participants say groups have been steadily engaged in aligning messages and strategies on how to target senators and their constituents. The goal: coordinate their actions to have maximum effect. What do they want? According to one Democratic outside group source: \u201cA grassroots explosion.\u201d According to a Republican outside group source: \u201cProtection for our folks while letting their vulnerables know there are consequences in November for opposition.\u201d A sampling: Judicial Crisis Network, by far the most powerful (and plugged in) conservative outside group in the fight, launched a $1.4 million television ad buy in Alabama (Jones), Indiana (Donnelly), North Dakota (Heitkamp) and West Virginia (Manchin). Americans for Prosperity, the powerful Koch-backed grassroots group, pledged \u201cseven figures\u201d to back Kavanaugh and has already launched its state-based chapters into door knocking and phone calls in each of 10 Trump-won states where Senate Democrats face re-election. Demand Justice, while new, has moved to the center of the Democratic opposition push. Seven figures are in play for this group, led by former top Schumer adviser Brian Fallon, and it has already demonstrated close ties to the biggest names on the left. A note on this: Keep a close eye on new groups, with ambiguous names, that pop up in the days ahead. Individual donors with big cash can, have and may this time, get involved in this and also play a role. Walking a fine line: These pressure campaigns can backfire. Senators bristle at outside money pouring into their states, particularly if it\u2019s sharply negative. The strategic tone and tenor of the campaigns on both sides will be fascinating to watch.",

            "article_content": "Just minutes after President Donald Trump announced he\u2019d nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court on Monday night, the fight for his confirmation began, a bruising showdown that will test the resolve of both parties to stay united and will ultimately reshape the Supreme Court for decades to come. In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s focus now turns to holding his sometimes-fractured Republican conference together and charging ahead with the nomination in a way that won\u2019t threaten Republicans\u2019 chances in the midterm elections. With a narrow majority and GOP Sen. John McCain back in Arizona fighting cancer, McConnell cannot afford to lose a single Republican vote without convincing Democrats to cross the aisle and back a candidate who is largely seen as a conservative nominee. In recent days, the Kentucky Republican \u2013 who oversaw the successful confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch last year \u2013 has played a significant behind-the-scenes role, consulting the President and his team daily on strategy and the political realities that await any nominee. It was McConnell, according to one GOP official, who suggested that Arizona\u2019s former Sen. John Kyl should act as the \u201cSherpa,\u201d the person responsible for guiding the nominee around Capitol Hill as they begin the work of meeting with senators individually. McConnell warned Trump earlier that Kavanaugh could be more difficult to confirm given his long history and paper trail, The New York Times reported over the weekend, and sources in both parties have said it could be difficult to move the nomination quickly. On Monday night, however, McConnell applauded Trump\u2019s announcement. Brett Kavanaugh: Washington insider has said presidents should be shielded from litigation while in office \u201cPresident Trump has made a superb choice. Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an impressive nominee who is extremely well qualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cJudge Kavanaugh has sterling academic credentials. He is widely admired for his intellect, experience, and exemplary judicial temperament. He has won the respect of his peers and is highly regarded throughout the legal community. And his judicial record demonstrates a firm understanding of the role of a judge in our Republic: Setting aside personal views and political preferences in order to interpret our laws as they are written.\u201d Still, it\u2019s unclear if McConnell will be able to hold his conference together. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine are considered swing votes on the Republican side of the aisle \u2013 two members who voted against GOP-led efforts to repeal Obamacare last year \u2013 and have expressed concerns about any action to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling. Collins committed to \u201ccareful, thorough vetting\u201d of Kavanaugh\u2019s record but her statement released in the wake of the announcement did not suggest how she would vote. \u201cJudge Kavanaugh has impressive credentials and extensive experience, having served more than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI will conduct a careful, thorough vetting of the President\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, as I have done with the five previous Supreme Court Justices whom I have considered.  I look forward to Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and to questioning him in a meeting in my office.\u201d Republicans say they are confident they can approve the nominee and that the next few weeks shouldn\u2019t bring their party to the brink. Instead, they say it should be easy to hold Republicans together on an issue that mobilizes the base and provides a pathway to expand the conservative reach on the courts. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be hard. Republicans will all be there,\u201d Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, a Republican member of the leadership team, told reporters Monday night ahead of the announcement. Democratic unity, meanwhile, will be tested. Immediately, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York announced his opposition to Kavanaugh and encouraged other Democrats to vote with him. \u201cI will oppose Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination with everything I have, and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same. The stakes are simply too high for anything less,\u201d Schumer said in his statement. \u201cThis nomination could alter the balance of the court in favor of powerful special interests and against working families for a generation, and would take away labor, civil, and human rights from millions of Americans. We cannot let that happen. If we can successfully block this nomination, it could lead to a more independent, moderate selection that both parties could support.\u201d But with just four months until the midterms, all eyes are on Democrats running for re-election in states Trump carried in 2016. Three of them, North Dakota\u2019s Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Indiana\u2019s Sen. Joe Donnelly and West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, voted for Gorsuch last year and face re-election in 2018. \u201cI think they also want to be re-elected and those three are running in red states where President Trump did very well. So they are going to be torn, no question. But it\u2019s their responsibility,\u201d Majority Whip Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, said before the announcement. \u201cMy assumption is once they voted for someone like Neil Gorsuch, it\u2019s not such a great leap to vote for one of these four who are in the pool being considered by the President.\u201d Four red-state Democrats turned down invitations from the White House to attend Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee announcement. Red state Democrats released statements Monday night saying they wanted time to examine the nominee\u2019s record, meet with him and see his confirmation hearing before making up their minds. What the Supreme Court fight will tell us about Democrats \u201cI take my constitutional duty to screen the President\u2019s nominees very seriously, and in the coming weeks I look forward to meeting with Judge Kavanaugh,\u201d Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, said in a statement. \u201cMontanans have a lot on the line with this next Supreme Court Justice so I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put politics aside and do what\u2019s best for this nation.\u201d Democrats are expected to cast Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation as a referendum on the future of the Affordable Care Act and abortion, issues that may make it harder for a handful of moderate Republicans to stick together. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat who is up for re-election in Florida, said in a statement that he will carefully review Kavanaugh\u2019s record on health care. \u201cI look forward to meeting with the president\u2019s nominee in the coming weeks to discuss his views on several important issues such as protecting women\u2019s rights, guaranteeing access to health care for those with pre-existing conditions and protecting the right to vote, just to name a few,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI will make my decision after that.\u201d Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat facing re-election in Pennsylvania this year, announced he was opposed to Trump\u2019s pick for the court hours before it was even announced \u2013 though it had by that point been narrowed to four finalists. \u201cI will oppose the nomination the President will (make) tonight because it represents a corrupt bargain with the far Right, big corporations, and Washington special interests,\u201d Casey said in a statement. Kavanaugh is expected to visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday and begin meeting with senators. CNN\u2019s John King, Phil Mattingly, Ted Barrett and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The next few weeks figure to be extraordinarily painful for Democrats. What\u2019s still to be decided is whether the years \u2013 and decades \u2013 to come will follow with more of the same. President Donald Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, will almost certainly be confirmed by Senate Republicans and, depending on how the confirmation hearings unfold, a few red state Democrats. The future of Roe v. Wade, along with Obamacare and other core liberal achievements, will soon be considered ripe for conservative legal and legislative challenges. Some 12 days after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his decision to retire, Democratic leaders in Washington have yet to coalesce around a clear strategy for opposing his would-be successor. Progressive groups are working to organize and energize the opposition, but they too have been vague in articulating how or by what means this fight ultimately breaks their way. They must also be aware, and have to live with the fact, that a number of the 10 Democrats running for re-election in states Trump won \u2013 Democrats they\u2019ll need to rely on if they can reclaim a majority \u2013 may break with the party, as some did in backing Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. It\u2019s a pitiable state of affairs. The choice of Kavanaugh might stir up some agita on the right, but there\u2019s little doubt the GOP will coalesce around him when it counts. The best case for Democrats, meanwhile, is to keep from splintering while parlaying almost certain defeat into more fuel for the base as the midterm elections approach and the 2020 presidential season comes up on the horizon. Achieving that will require a shift in thinking both on and off Capitol Hill. To start, it\u2019s hardly a cop-out to concede that, more than any ideological divide on the left or lack of tactical imagination, the trouble for Democrats now is rooted in simple math. Unless a GOP senator joins them, Democrats don\u2019t have the votes to defeat Kavanaugh. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights, could, in theory, break ranks with their party. But that seems less likely at this point than red state Democrats, especially those facing re-election, peeling off in favor of Trump\u2019s nominee. But if Democrats have learned anything from the campaign that ended with Trump\u2019s election, or the years of political brawling that created the environment in which a Trump candidacy could flourish and win, they should understand now that the old rules no longer apply. So it goes for the long-standing conventional wisdom, which holds that an independent streak, a \u201cmaverick\u201d tendency to \u201cbuck the party\u201d (as the clich\u00e9s go), is the best way to win over either nonideological or ideologically opposed voters. That means, in this Supreme Court fight, unified opposition will be essential \u2013 even if it falls short of being successful. It means leadership, starting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, need to do everything in their power to deny Trump and the GOP their way. Massachusetts\u2019 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a rumored 2020 presidential contender, tried to set the stakes early on. \u201cSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement means that women\u2019s health, equal marriage, and civil rights are all at risk,\u201d she tweeted hours after the announcement. \u201cThis is the fight of our lives.\u201d And one that Democrats will only suffer more for backing down from. Capitulation here will only compound the damage done and sow more doubt over whether the party can be trusted to defend its most fundamental, core principles. Up for re-election this fall in a state won by Trump in 2016,  Pennsylvania\u2019s Sen. Bob Casey, one of the few Democrats who oppose abortion rights, found a way to oppose the nominee before he was even announced. Casey gave progressives a jolt \u2013 and his colleagues a lesson \u2013 on Monday by revealing plans to oppose the pick hours before it was made. He argued in a statement that Trump\u2019s decision to select from a list of 25 options \u201cdictated to him by the Heritage Foundation\u201d undermined the process from the start and that \u201cany judge on this list is fruit of a corrupt process straight from the D.C. swamp.\u201d Unified opposition, it turns out, doesn\u2019t require unified thought or tactics. Casey\u2019s much redder state colleagues have been more circumspect. Alabama\u2019s Doug Jones and North Dakota\u2019s Heidi Heitkamp, the latter facing a tough re-election fight, signaled some openness to backing Trump\u2019s choice. West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin could be swayed. Joe Donnelly, of Indiana, is another GOP target. Theirs are politically unenviable positions, to be sure. But if the logic guiding their votes doesn\u2019t factor in a legacy that stretches beyond the coming elections, they could end up confirming not only a justice, but also a more damaging suspicion about the Democratic Party.

            "article_content": "Here we go. President Donald Trump will announce his Supreme Court nominee at 9 p.m. As of this moment, nobody on Capitol Hill knows the selection, according to several senior aides (which, of course, makes sense given the President himself said he hadn\u2019t finalized the selection as of Sunday evening). Every Senate Republican who wanted to provide their opinion or lobby for a candidate has had an opportunity to do so (and most have taken that opportunity, aides say). Invites have gone out to senators to attend the White House announcement, two aides tell CNN. But once the selection is made, all that matters is the roughly eight- or nine-week countdown to a vote on the Senate floor. Bottom line: The coming days will be all about deep dives into the record of Trump\u2019s selection, but also an intensive outside game by affiliated groups in both parties to lock in the contours of what will be a vicious fight. Monday night\u2019s announcement may be in prime time, but it will serve solely as a brightly lit, nationally televised precursor to the real battle ahead. The reality: Millions of dollars will be spent by both sides. Thousands of pages of documents \u2013 ranging from details on cases and authored legal articles to public comments, education experience, past work in previous administrations or on Capitol Hill \u2013 will be pored over by congressional staff, outside groups and reporters as the days move toward the confirmation hearing. The pressure on a select group of senators will be extreme. The outcome will have an effect not just in November, but far more importantly, on the highest court in the land for quite possibly decades to come. What\u2019s ahead, in a quote: \u201cWe\u2019re prepared for an all-out war,\u201d one GOP operative planning to work on the confirmation effort put it to me. \u201cThe full machinery of the Republican Party is going to kick into high gear. And I have no doubt the other side will deploy the same.\u201d What to watch for on Capitol Hill: Initial reactions will be important, but the key senators in play won\u2019t tip their hands until they have ample time to study the pick, multiple aides say. That means close attention should be paid to the team assembled by the White House \u2013 who the pick\u2019s \u201cSherpa\u201d will be on the Hill, how initial meetings are set up, with who and when, etc. As a guide, just go back to 2017. Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a well-liked member of the chamber who was defeated the previous November, served as Gorsuch\u2019s Sherpa, and the outside and inside team\u2019s responsible for shepherding the nomination were given high marks by Republicans. \u201cCan\u2019t go wrong replicating what they did with Gorsuch,\u201d one GOP aide said when asked how the White House should handle this nomination. But \u2013 and this is important: This isn\u2019t the Gorsuch nomination. Gorsuch was replacing a conservative justice. This nominee would replace a swing vote \u2013 and tilt the court toward conservatives for years to come. A numbers reminder: This state of play still stands and this is your best guide. But in shorthand, Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate. Republican aides make clear there is no expectation Sen. John McCain, who remains in Arizona fighting cancer, will return for any vote. That means they can\u2019t afford to lose a single Republican if \u2013 and this is a big if \u2013 Democrats are unified in their opposition to Trump\u2019s pick. What it also means: If McConnell can keep his conference together, there isn\u2019t anything Democrats can do to block the confirmation. What\u2019s coming: A massive, dual-pronged pressure campaign \u2013 one targeting Sens. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, and Susan Collins, of Maine, and one targeting moderate, red-state Democrats, is already teed up (some ads have already started running in key states). Groups on both sides will pour cash into the effort. How much will be spent: \u201cTens of millions of dollars,\u201d was the estimate of one of the players in the outside effort. That doesn\u2019t just mean television ads \u2013 that means rallies, marches, grassroots efforts \u2013 everything that can be done to try and persuade, cajole and pressure will be deployed. -Judicial Crisis Network, a key player in confirming Gorsuch that has already been up with television ads, will be up with another buy targeting red state Democrats tonight. Keep an eye on Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity to also throw a seven-figure sum into the battle. -Demand Justice, the new-ish Democratic-aligned group, is planning to spend millions on its side. Keep an eye on NARAL and other aligned groups on the left starting to spend as well. Groups opposed to the selection have also already scheduled a rally at the Supreme Court opposing the pick Monday night at 9:15 p.m. The messages: A simplified version, previewed by lawmakers and aides: Republicans will point to the nominee as a conservative who will hew closely to the Constitution and will be in the mold of Gorsuch, whose time on the court has already won plaudits in the party. Democrats have made clear their fight will center primarily on two things: abortion and health care. The former due to a potential swing vote on Roe v. Wade. The latter due to the court\u2019s role in defining the parameters of the US health care system in the years ahead. The strategy: Republicans: keep the train on the tracks, the party together and possibly pick off a few Democrats. Democrats: drive a grassroots frenzy of opposition, given the stakes of replacing someone like Justice Anthony Kennedy, to unify their caucus and peel off at least one GOP senator. The players on the Hill: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: The New York Times and John King have very good rundowns of the role McConnell has played behind the scenes in the past few weeks. McConnell allies I\u2019ve spoken to make clear: he\u2019s not advocating for any one selection (though he certainly would\u2019ve been pleased had Amul Thapur been in the final four). He\u2019s providing advice on the dynamics of the Senate. McConnell is firmly in the \u201chow do I secure 50 votes\u201d position now, regardless of the selection. And that means, in his view, there are two candidates \u2013 Thomas Hardiman and Raymond Kethledge \u2013 who would have the clearest path to confirmation, for several reasons, ranging from depth of past work/paper trail (in Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s case) and awareness of the two generally pro-choice senators in his conference (in the case of Amy Coney Barrett). The clear goal, according to several aides, is to lock in all 50 GOP senators in support. Any Democrats that come along would be an added bonus. But one ally made clear \u201cYou simply can\u2019t take anything for granted at this stage.\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer: It\u2019s fair to say nobody in this fight has a tougher task. The Democratic leader needs to keep his caucus together \u2013 even as several face potential electoral fallout for voting against the nominee \u2013 while helping to persuade at least one Republican to vote against a pick that will tilt the court to the right, all as he attempts to mollify an agitated base that questions whether Democrats are adequately fighting Trump and McConnell. He faces extreme pressure from the liberal grassroots, outraged by then-President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 selection never getting a hearing, to utilize any procedural tool possible to all but shut down the chamber to block the nomination (this is both unlikely and questionable in its efficacy), all while balancing the several moderate senators who face their own individual pressures. Schumer has made clear in his comments and writing up to this point that the clearest way to blocking the pick is through a groundswell of outside pressure \u2013 and given the stakes, that pressure will certainly come to bear to some degree. Whether it will reach the critical mass to have Schumer\u2019s intended effect is still a very open question. Worth noting: Democratic leadership and the key (and moneyed) outside groups have been working closely to coordinate in the past week, sources say. Murkowski/Collins: Think precedent. Think stare decisis (several GOPers have flagged the Roberts/Specter exchange in 2005 as a potential model for any nominee.) Why? Think Roe v. Wade (or Casey v. Planned Parenthood.) With Democrats making clear they view this pick as a referendum on Roe v. Wade \u2013 and given the positions of Collins and Murkowski on that serving as an issue that is settled \u2013 an inordinate amount of time in the weeks ahead will be spent on not just where the nominee stands on the issue (it\u2019s unlikely any nominee will shed much light on that front, several aides note), but more importantly, where these two senators believe the nominee stands on the issue. The public hearing will matter, yes. But the private meetings with these two senators may matter far more. Needless to say, Democrats aren\u2019t hesitating \u2013 they view Collins and Murkowski as the two targets to peel off from McConnell\u2019s majority. And they vote abortion rights \u2013 and health care in general \u2013 as the pathway to possibly do it. One note on this front: Murkowski and Collins were heroes to the left when they opposed the Obamacare repeal effort. Then they were castigated by the same group when they voted in favor of the tax overhaul. It\u2019s important to see the differences in those two issues \u2013 Collins and Murkowski align far more with GOP orthodoxy on taxes (not to mention the inclusion of ANWR in the tax law in Murkowski\u2019s case) than on health care. This is not an insignificant reason why Democrats are so sharply focusing their counter arguments what a new justice may mean for the US health care system. As to the pressure? Let\u2019s just say this isn\u2019t the first rodeo for either. As Sen. Marco Rubio put it plainly: \u201cListen, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins can handle pressure. These are very serious, professional people with strong legislative records.\u201d Sens. Joe Donnelly/Joe Manchin/Heidi Heitkamp: All three of these senators voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch. All three of these senators face re-election races in states Trump won by double-digits in 2016. All three of these senators were invited to the White House before the July 4 recess week to meet with the President on, among other things, the Supreme Court selection process. All three have made clear they are keeping an open mind on the selection, and all three are very much in play to support the nominee. Sens. Claire McCaskill/Bill Nelson/Doug Jones: McCaskill and Nelson both face tough re-election battles in Trump-won states. Jones hails from ruby red Alabama. All three are keeping their options open. GOP aides are looking at Nelson as the most likely of the three to possibly come their way, but there\u2019s little in the way of evidence, beyond the very difficult race, that backs that up at the moment. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley/Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein: These two veteran legislators will likely receive less attention than the aforementioned 10, but they (and, perhaps more importantly, their respective staffers) will be crucial in the weeks ahead. Grassley chairs the Judiciary Committee, Feinstein is the top Democrat on the panel. They will help dictate the tone, tenor and tempo of the confirmation hearing and, to some degree, the process itself.

            "article_content": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer appealed to President Donald Trump to repeat his predecessor\u2019s choice and nominate federal judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court for a second time \u201cas a way to unify the country,\u201d according to a source. The President phoned the New York Democrat on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy, according to a person familiar with the call. The Washington Post was the first to report the contents of the call. According to the source, Schumer warned Trump of \u201ccataclysmic\u201d consequences if he picked a nominee that is \u201chostile\u201d to the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade \u2013 the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. \u201cSchumer also warned the President that if he picked someone hostile to Roe, and hostile to the ACA, that it would be \u2018cataclysmic,\u2019 tear the country apart in a way it hasn\u2019t been for some time, and be bad for the President\u2019s legacy,\u201d the source told CNN. The White House did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The source also said that Trump\u2019s call to Schumer \u201cseemed more like a check-the-box call than meaningful consultation, given that it came after Trump had narrowed his short list and begun interviewing candidates.\u201d Garland, who is the chief judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was nominated by President Barack Obama in 2016 to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. However, Republicans refused to hold a hearing on his nomination, citing the 2016 election. Justice Neil Gorsuch was eventually nominated by Trump and confirmed to the bench last April, and Garland returned to his job in the judiciary. Last year, after Trump fired James Comey, several prominent Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recommended that Garland fill the role of FBI director. Over the past few days, the President met with at least seven contenders and is believed to have whittled his list of potential candidates down to two or three, sources familiar with the search told CNN. Judges Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, Amy Coney Barrett, and Amul Thapar, Joan Larsen and Thomas Hardiman are under consideration for the job, sources told CNN. CNN\u2019s Ariane de Vogue, Jeff Zeleny and Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump, a political impresario and disrupter, is never happier than when holding the world in thrall. But the next 11 days \u2013 when he is expected to enlist a new Supreme Court pick, the British Queen and the Russian President as supporting actors in his melodrama \u2013 could be extreme even by his standards. A heady sequence of high-profile events, summits and photo-ops at home and abroad will position Trump as a dominant figure in global politics whose wrecking ball leadership style could be felt years after he has left office. By mid-July, America and the world may not feel quite the same. Trump\u2019s spin in the spotlight begins Thursday with a four-day countdown to his unveiling of a Supreme Court pick who is likely to enshrine a conservative majority on the nation\u2019s highest bench for decades into the future. After basking in the certain accolades of his conservative base, Trump will turn his eyes to the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, which is shaping up as one of the most pivotal meetings in the alliance\u2019s history. From there, Trump will head to Britain for his long-delayed visit, which is likely to include an eye-catching photo-op with Queen Elizabeth II that will match perhaps the world\u2019s ultimate symbol of duty, continuity and convention with the most unpredictable, protocol-busting US leader in history. At the end of Trump\u2019s barnstorming 11 days comes his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Finland, an encounter that will unleash new speculation about his baffling relationship with the Kremlin strongman and \u2013 depending on how things go at NATO \u2013 could cast new clouds over the destiny of West. The President\u2019s first task is to choreograph a rollout for the replacement for retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, an opening that represents a priceless political chance for him to cement his hold on American life and culture for decades. Every sign is that Trump is considering relatively young nominees who could serve for a quarter century or more. His first pick, Neil Gorsuch, is already a talisman for conservatives, and Trump will aim to manage the debut of his next nominee to assure a clean confirmation process. His first go-around last year was one of the smoothest, least dramatic episodes so far in an otherwise chaotic presidency, and vindicated the support that some skeptical conservatives gave his 2016 candidacy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you a great one,\u201d Trump told supporters in West Virginia on Tuesday night. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be very impressed. These are very talented people, brilliant people and I think you\u2019re going to really love it, like Justice Gorsuch. We hit a home run there, and we\u2019re going to hit a home run here,\u201d Trump said. The President is sure to spend the weekend driving anticipation for his announcement, like a television producer building suspense for a prime-time show. While the dynamics of Washington\u2019s Republican-dominated political scene mean Democrats have little leverage to stop a nomination they see as a generational disaster, there are signs the process may be more complicated than the Gorsuch confirmation. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that she would not vote for a nominee hostile to the Roe v Wade ruling upholding the constitutional right to an abortion. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, is under scrutiny for similar reasons. Both senators voted to confirm Gorsuch, however, who most conservatives believe would vote to overturn Roe v Wade. Intense lobbying is taking place ahead of Trump\u2019s announcement, with some divisions appearing in legal circles between supporters of Judge Amy Coney Barrett -- a favorite of social conservatives \u2013 and Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who some in the movement feel has been insufficiently supportive in some rulings on key planks of its orthodoxy. Whoever Trump picks, though, is likely to be the culmination of a decades-long effort by the conservative legal community to dictate the ideological balance of the court. The NATO summit in Brussels on Wednesday and next Thursday is one of the most consequential meetings of Western leaders since the end of the Cold War. Trump\u2019s hostility to multinational institutions and his belief that America\u2019s allies are freeloading off its security guarantees have convinced many alliance diplomats that the most successful post-World War II national security institution could be at risk. Such fears multiplied after Trump feuded with allied leaders at the G7 summit in Canada, where he complained that NATO was worse than NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he is trying to renegotiate with Mexico and Canada. Trump will call on NATO leaders to live up to the alliance\u2019s target of 2% of their gross domestic product for defense spending, after sending letters to some governments warning of a reassessment of US priorities in Europe if they fail to do so. Trump is not the first US President to bemoan NATO spending ... but no one did it like this Also looming over the summit is bad blood between Trump and European Union leaders over a gathering trade war sparked by his imposition of sanctions on steel and aluminum imports to the US. German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned Wednesday that Trump\u2019s threats to impose tariffs on European car imports to the US could have dire consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s worth every effort to try and defuse this so that this conflict does not become a war,\u201d she told German lawmakers. Trump will finally make his first visit as President to Britain on July 13. His arrival is expected to spark mass protests in London. His stay is being categorized as a working visit and won\u2019t see the pageantry of the full state occasion that the leader of Britain\u2019s closest ally usually enjoys. Details of the visit are yet to be announced. But Trump is expected to stay out of central London and to see Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle for the most keenly awaited photo-op of the visit. He is then likely to meet Prime Minister Theresa May \u2013 for whom his visit marks a dicey political assignment \u2013 at her official country residence, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire, west of London, diplomatic sources said. Trump reportedly told May in a telephone call after he was elected in November 2016 that his late mother, Mary, was a big admirer of the Queen, so his audience with the world\u2019s longest-reigning monarch may be a poignant moment for the President, as well as an encounter that unites two of the world\u2019s most famous people. Trump is also expected to visit one of his golf courses in his mother\u2019s homeland \u2013 Scotland \u2013 during the trip. Trump\u2019s summit with Putin is exactly the kind of high-profile, headline-grabbing encounter he relishes. But it also poses a significant risk given the Russian leader\u2019s skills as a ruthless and accomplished diplomatic power player. US allies are concerned that Trump will be so fixated with his looming summit with Putin in Helsinki that he will be unable to concentrate on the NATO summit or may see getting tough on allied leaders as a way to impress the Russian President. Trump\u2019s first stand-alone summit with Putin on July 16 will renew speculation about his approach to one foreign leader whom he never criticizes and who is accused by US intelligence agencies of meddling in the 2016 election to help Trump win. Trump doesn't care what people think about his relationship with Putin That intrigue will deepen if Trump goes ahead with his plan to huddle with Putin alone apart from interpreters before throwing open the meeting to wider delegations. Trump is under pressure to raise the issue of election meddling with Putin, since he has repeatedly highlighted the Russian leader\u2019s denials that Moscow\u2019s espionage agencies were involved, in defiance of his own clandestine community. Trump\u2019s claims that the election interference saga is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and a plot by Democratic and \u201cdeep state\u201d foes absorbed a blow with the release of a report by a key Senate panel Tuesday that endorsed the findings of US intelligence agencies. Despite the political clouds over the summit, the two sides have grave issues to discuss since relations are in their worst since the fall of the Soviet Union. Trump is adamant that he can repair the poisoned US-Russia relationship. The talks are expected to focus on the geopolitical mire in Syria, fears of a new nuclear arms race and Trump\u2019s effort to convince North Korea to end its own nuclear and missile programs. But few analysts are expecting big progress. \u201cDomestic politics has made it hard to get to the summit, but it\u2019s divisions over actual issues that will make the summit deliverables difficult,\u201d said Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center.",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court confirmation hearings often develop their own tenor, depending on the nominee and the issues of the day. Even without a choice yet from President Donald Trump, two themes already have emerged: Russia and Roe. Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide, has been a Senate Judiciary Committee perennial for decades. But the fate of the landmark ruling is likely to consume more of the questioning between senators and the nominee this time simply because Trump, as a candidate, vowed to appoint justices who would reverse Roe and leave abortion law to the states. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election and ties to the Trump campaign is already hovering over the Trump Supreme Court selection. Presidential prerogatives would loom even more if the nominee is US Appeals Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the short-lister who has had the greatest experience with executive-power dilemmas, as a lawyer with independent counsel Ken Starr\u2019s investigation of President Bill Clinton and then as a top aide to President George W. Bush. Trump ponders midterms, history and drama for Supreme Court pick Irrespective of the nominee, the televised hearings could preview for the American public controversies that could ultimately reach the justices, including whether a sitting president could be criminally indicted or whether a president may pardon himself. That latter question was already put to another short-lister, US Appeals Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett, when she was before the Senate Judiciary Committee last September. On Sunday\u2019s edition of CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal said, \u201cThe President should not be permitted to appoint a justice who will decide whether or not he complies with a subpoena to testify before a grand jury, or pardons himself.\u201d \u201cI believe that whoever is appointed,\u201d Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, added, \u201cought to recuse himself and commit to recusing himself from those kinds of decisions that affect the personal finances or the special prosecutor investigation.\u201d White House builds Supreme Court confirmation team Rarely are commitments made at confirmation hearings and the sessions often become a forum for evasion. Still the back-and-forth between senators and a nominee tends to capture the dominant legal concerns of the day. In late June 2010, for example, President Barack Obama\u2019s appointee Elena Kagan faced senators eager to air their complaints about the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling issued five months earlier. In fact, Kagan, as the US solicitor general, had argued against that decision lifting federal regulation of corporate and labor campaign spending. Kagan\u2019s more serious critics challenged her decision, as dean of Harvard\u2019s law school, to temporarily bar military recruiters from campus facilities because of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy against openly gay troops. In July 2009, skeptics of Obama nominee Sonia Sotomayor, poised to be the first Hispanic justice, focused on racially charged controversies, particularly a 2001 Sotomayor remark that she hoped \u201ca wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn\u2019t lived that life.\u201d More recently, in the March 2017 hearings for Neil Gorsuch, several questions focused on judicial independence \u2013 because of Trump\u2019s criticism of judges who had ruled in early litigation against his travel ban tied to majority-Muslim countries. Trump has said he will make his choice of a successor to retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy pubic next Monday. Among those on his shortlist with Kavanaugh and Barrett are US Appeals Court Judges Thomas Hardiman, who sits on the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit, and Raymond Kethledge and Amul Thapar, who both sit on the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit. The Starr investigation, for which Kavanaugh worked, was propelled forward partly by a 1997 Supreme Court decision, Clinton v. Jones, that declared that the president could not invoke presidential immunity to postpone a civil lawsuit by Paula Jones, who said he had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas. The following year, Starr obtained a subpoena to compel Clinton\u2019s testimony is a separate matter, involving Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern with whom Clinton had had a relationship. But Kavanaugh said after serving with Bush, who named him to the District of Columbia Circuit Court in 2006, he came to believe the demands of the White House too great to subject the president to civil or criminal litigation. Here are potential Supreme Court nominees to replace Justice Kennedy \u201c(T)he indictment and trial of a sitting president,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in a 2009 law review, \u201cwould cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.\u201d \u201cOne might raise at least two important critiques of these ideas,\u201d Kavanaugh acknowledged in his essay published in the Minnesota Law Review. \u201cThe first is that no one is above the law in our system of government. I strongly agree with that principle. But it is not ultimately a persuasive criticism of these suggestions. The point is not to put the President above the law or to eliminate checks on the President, but simply to defer litigation and investigations until the President is out of office. \u201cA second possible concern is that the country needs a check against a bad-behaving or law-breaking President. But the Constitution already provides that check. If the President does something dastardly, the impeachment process is available.\u201d Because of the controversy spurred by the Mueller investigation, which Trump has repeatedly deemed a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d senators have begun asking lower court nominees about related legal issues, along with the time-tested Roe v. Wade. Last September, while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a seat on the Chicago-based 7th Circuit, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent on Roe, which the high court has said means government cannot impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women seeking to end a pregnancy before the fetus is viable. \u201cCan a president pardon himself?\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, asked Barrett in a follow-up written question. \u201cI have not studied that issue,\u201d Barrett responded. \u201cIf confirmed and that issue were to come before me as part of a case or controversy, I would resolve that issue as I would any other \u2013 by engaging in the judicial process, which includes examining the facts, reading the briefs, conducting necessary research, listening to the arguments of litigants, discussing the matter with colleagues, and writing and/or reading opinions.\u201d Such may be the guarded tone of many answers, irrespective of the question or of the nominee.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are banking on a surge of female candidates to help them recapture the House of Representatives this November, especially with an approaching Supreme Court nomination fight that may revolve largely around the question of legal access to abortion. But Democrats may not benefit as much as they hope from this dynamic unless their historic roster of female nominees can help the party solve its greatest remaining challenge with female voters. To talk of a Democratic challenge with female voters may seem somewhat jarring. Polls during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency consistently show a huge gender gap, with women routinely expressing more negative views than men of Trump\u2019s performance, and a greater preference for Democrats in Congress. Big segments of the female population \u2013 including African-American, millennial and college-educated white women \u2013 are displaying towering levels of discontent with Trump. More voters want candidates who support abortion access Yet that overall advantage for Democrats masks a continuing problem among one key group of female voters: white women without a college education. Strong support from those blue-collar white women was key to Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, particularly in decisive Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. While polls indicate the Republican position among those women has weakened since 2016, surveys still consistently show more of them prefer the GOP than Democrats for Congress in 2018. If that pattern holds, it will make it difficult for Democrats to extend their election gains into more blue-collar and less urban House seats beyond the white-collar suburbs where Trump is weakest. And that would leave the party facing a tight squeeze to capture the 24 seats it needs to regain the House majority. The debate over abortion triggered by this week\u2019s retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy could change this calculus \u2013 but it\u2019s also possible that it will do more to extend the Democrats\u2019 advantage where they are already strongest \u2013 Among African-American and college-educated white women \u2013 than to loosen the Republican hold on working-class white women. In primaries this year, the preference of Democratic voters for female candidates has been dramatic. David Wasserman, who follows House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, recently calculated that in Democratic House primaries featuring no incumbent and at least one female and one male candidate, a woman has won the most votes in 66 of 93 cases, or 71%. In all, through June 13, Wasserman calculates, Democrats have chosen female nominees in 73 of the 150 House primaries held so far without incumbents. That compares with just 18 female nominees in 112 Republican House primaries without incumbents, he found. In many respects, the Democratic tilt toward female candidates is the logical culmination of the political dynamics since Trump\u2019s election. Coming after he bragged about sexually assaulting women in the 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, Trump\u2019s election provoked its greatest backlash among Democratic-leaning women. That intensity was immediately apparent in the unprecedented women-led protest marches the weekend of Trump\u2019s inauguration. The emergence of the #metoo movement and the proliferation of sexual harassment allegations against powerful men in other arenas has only added fuel to that fire. \u201cClearly the surge of women candidates is part of something much bigger,\u201d says veteran Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, who is extensively studying female voters this year for the Democratic group Women\u2019s Voices Women Vote Action Fund. \u201cWomen in every social class, and every generation, have been hit by the Trump presidency and the effect and the political disruption of the women\u2019s march and the women candidates. Each of these things is reinforcing the trend.\u201d Republicans and Democrats increasingly really do occupy different worlds Democrats have already experienced tangible benefits from the backlash against Trump among key groups of women. Huge margins and strong turnout among African-American women helped drive the victories of Ralph Northam in last fall\u2019s Virginia governor\u2019s race and Doug Jones in the Alabama US Senate contest. Northam and Jones also benefited from a surge toward them among college-educated white women. Both of these groups appear poised to deliver big advantages to Democrats again in November. Black women, by all indications, remain one of the electorate\u2019s most energized groups. And there are some signs that this November could prove a realigning election among college-educated white women. Those white-collar white women often tilt Democratic, but usually modestly. In exit polls since 1992, House Democrats have never carried more than 52% of them; in 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Trump among them, but only by a comparable margin of 51% to 44%. In presidential races extending back to 1980, the Democrats\u2019 best performance among them was the 52% that Barack Obama carried in 2008 and Al Gore won in 2000. Polling so far this year shows the potential for a much sharper swing toward Democrats among those white-collar women. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal national poll, 64% of college-educated white women said they disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance and 60% said they preferred Democrats for Congress, while just 30% wanted Republicans. In a Monmouth University Poll released\u202fMonday, Democrats led among college-educated white women by 57% to 38%. \u201cI think you are talking about realignment levels of gains among college-educated women here that are also associated with a big disruptive political event that is changing consciousness,\u201d said Greenberg, who recently conducted focus groups among white-collar white women in suburban Oakland County, Michigan. \u201cClearly there is a building solidarity in their communities about what is happening. And they are talking about their values in ways that they didn\u2019t easily talk about them (before) \u2013 they talked about the way Trump treated people, tolerance, about bringing out conflict between different groups. There are so many ways in which the Trump presidency has led college white women to understand their shared values and it is producing big electoral numbers.\u201d The movement toward Democrats among white-collar white women seems certain to be reinforced by the prospect that Trump will nominate, and the Republican Senate will confirm, a replacement for Kennedy who is committed to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a nationwide legal right to abortion. If the decision is overturned, regulation of abortion could shift back to the states and many conservative states already have laws on the book reinstating an abortion ban if Roe is reversed. Polling has consistently shown that a majority of Americans believe abortion should remain legal in most cases. Those sentiments are especially strong among two groups of women that are already the most exercised about Trump and the congressional GOP. In 2017 polling by the Pew Research Center, 71% of college-educated white women and 63% of African-American women said abortion should remain legal in all or most cases, according to detailed results Pew provided to CNN. Cut another way, almost two-thirds of all women under 50 believe abortion should remain legal in most cases. Just over three-in-five college educated white men and nearly three-in-five African American men agreed. (A wild card is Hispanic women. Though a majority of them in the Pew poll said abortion should be less widely available, most of them are so estranged from Trump on other issues that even a visible fight over abortion probably won\u2019t move many to embrace him.) While those views threaten to further energize groups already recoiling from the GOP under Trump, opinions on abortion are less lopsided among groups Republicans are counting on in November. Non-college white men split almost evenly (50% to 48%) on whether abortion should remain legal in most cases. Non-college white women, as is often the case, fall between the blue-collar men and white-collar women: 56% of them said abortion should remain mostly legal, while 42% said it should be mostly illegal. Even nearly two-fifths of women who identify as Republicans said abortion should remain legal in most cases, Pew found. The non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation registered even greater support for the pro-choice position in a poll released this week when it asked respondents directly whether they wanted Roe overturned. About two-thirds of those polled said no, an overwhelming consensus that included three-fourths of college-educated white women, seven-in-10 college-educated white men and just over two-thirds of non-college white women. It\u2019s not clear whether that phrasing, or the question about availability of abortion, more accurately captures the underlying public divide. But either way, there aren\u2019t many issues where that many women in the GOP coalition tilt so heavily toward the position favored by most Democrats. Depending on how the debate over Kennedy\u2019s replacement unfolds, those splits may allow Democrats to pry more of these Republican-leaning and blue-collar women away from the GOP than they have managed to do over roughly the past two decades. Apart from health care, there aren\u2019t many issues where that many women in the GOP coalition tilt so heavily toward the position favored by most Democrats. Depending on how the debate over Kennedy\u2019s replacement unfolds, those splits may allow Democrats to pry more of these Republican-leaning and blue-collar women away from the GOP than they have managed to do over roughly the past two decades. Democrats have positioned themselves to maximize their widening advantage among well-educated white women by nominating female candidates in many of the suburban white-collar districts at the top of their target list. The list of female Democratic nominees in highly vulnerable Republican suburban seats is formidable: It includes state Sen. Jennifer Wexton in northern Virginia; law professor Katie Porter in Orange County, California; and nonprofit executive Katie Hill in the Los Angeles exurbs; former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey; attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher in suburban Houston; and attorney Mary Gay Scanlon and Air Force veteran Chrissy Houlahan outside Philadelphia. Democrats have also chosen women in several suburban seats that represent tougher climbs for the party (former CIA analyst Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, registered nurse Lauren Underwood in Illinois, social worker Kara Eastman in Omaha and small business owner Cindy Axne in Iowa). In primaries later this year, the party also appears likely to select female nominees in several other top targeted white-collar districts, including Miami, suburban Detroit, Minneapolis and Tucson, and potentially two seats outside Atlanta, where women will face men in July runoffs. The impact of this tilt toward female nominees isn\u2019t likely to be measured directly in shifting votes. Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at Rutgers University\u2019s Center for American Women and Politics, says the academic research finds little evidence that female voters are more likely to vote for female candidates. \u201cFor the most part, studies find that there is very little by way of a gender affinity affect,\u201d she said in an interview. Is the GOP at risk of losing Catholics? But the large number of female Democratic candidates, particularly in white-collar districts, could still have a significant effect by spurring more activism, engagement and turnout among the college-educated white women already most alienated from Trump. \u201cI think that having women on the ticket, being the candidates for the opposition in this moment, does have the potential to only heighten that enthusiasm and engagement among women more so than it changes their vote,\u201d says Dittmar, who\u2019s also an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers. \u201cMost of these women probably would have voted for a Democrat anyway \u2013 but does it increase their overall engagement with the election itself? Are they participating, going to the rallies, volunteering, giving more financial support \u2013 all those levels of engagement? I do think that is an outstanding question that we are all paying attention to.\u201d The risk for Republicans is that these dynamics reinforce each other: that even as more college-educated white women are recoiling from Trump\u2019s truculent vision of the GOP, the Democratic alternative is increasingly defined by professional women who look and sound like them. \u201cIt may be that this election realigns the way affluent college women look at the two parties, because you are also seeing a lot of professional women being elected as Democrats, and almost only as Democrats, as part of this wave. That may well reinforce what is happening with them,\u201d Greenberg says. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is just a blip.\u201d With college-educated white men, usually a reliably Republican group, also expressing in polls unusual resistance to Trump and a greater preference for Democrats, the sharp shift among well-educated white women creates a clear and present danger for Republicans in affluent suburban districts. Democrats have not carried more than 38% of college-educated white men in any House election since 2008, but this week\u2019s Monmouth Poll gave the party a 13-percentage-point advantage among them. But the equation still looks very different for Democrats in more blue-collar districts. There they face firm resistance among working-class white men: Nearly three-fifths of those men preferred Republicans for Congress in the Monmouth Poll and nearly two-thirds did so in the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey. Given Trump\u2019s enormous appeal for these men (his approval among them stood at 68% in the NBC/WSJ poll), the Democrats are unlikely to capture many blue-collar seats unless they can make substantial inroads among non-college white women. And on that front, they still face a difficult climb. Democrats have struggled enormously with these women in recent years. The party hasn\u2019t won more than 39% of them in any House election since 2008, and Trump beat Clinton, the first major-party female nominee, among them by 27 percentage points in 2016. Recent polls show some improvement for Democrats: They trailed among these non-college white women by 7 percentage points in the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal and Quinnipiac University surveys, though this week\u2019s Monmouth Poll gave Republicans a more daunting 13-percentage-point advantage among them. The growing prominent of abortion may provide Democrats an opportunity for greater gains than they have recorded in these polls, which were conducted before Kennedy\u2019s retirement. But given their troubles with working-class white men, Democrats will need to do better to win many of the blue-collar seats they are targeting. That\u2019s why the extent of the Democratic wave in November may be decided not so much by whether their female nominees can maximize their advantages among women in white-collar districts, but whether their female candidates can loosen the Republican hold on female voters in primarily blue-collar seats. Why the electoral battlefield is expanding On this tougher terrain, Democrats are also betting heavily on female candidates, including former Marine pilot Amy McGrath around Lexington, Kentucky, state Rep. Abby Finkenauer in northeast Iowa, former Air Force intelligence officer Gina Ortiz Jones outside San Antonio, attorney Susan Wild in Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley, former Navy Cmdr. Elaine Luria in southeast Virginia and university administrator Lisa Brown in eastern Washington state. (In seats that represent a tougher climb for the party, they have also nominated small business owner and community activist Betsy Londrigan in central Illinois, attorney Xochitl Torres Small in New Mexico and attorney Kathy Manning in northwest North Carolina.) It seems guaranteed that the fierce backlash against Trump among many well-educated white women will allow Democrats in November to elect a substantial class of new female representatives from suburban districts who could quickly become rising stars in the party. But whether Democrats win the House, much less establish any sizable majority, may depend more on whether female candidates such as McGrath, Wild and Finkenauer can establish connections with the blue-collar white women who helped put Trump into office \u2013 and haven\u2019t yet decided to walk away.

            "article_content": "Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement Wednesday, and almost immediately the US Senate was launched into the national spotlight as it\u2019s the legislative body that will formally confirm whoever the next justice will be. Here\u2019s what you need to know: An official familiar with the process told CNN\u2019s Ariane de Vogue the White House wants to unveil the pick by July 9, before the President departs for Europe. As evidence of the quick speed, the White House is already courting key senators \u2013 the President met with five of them last night in staggered meetings (as well as with Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley \u2013 more on that below). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly said a vote will happen this fall. They\u2019re not waiting until after the midterms, despite the fact that the Kentucky Republican waited for 2016 to end before holding a confirmation vote on the seat vacated by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans see this as an entirely different situation. This vacancy is happening in the middle of the President\u2019s first-term, not at the end of a President\u2019s second term. \u201cThese aren\u2019t the final months of a second-term constitutionally lame duck presidency with a presidential election fast approaching,\u201d McConnell said on the floor Thursday morning. \u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the same President,\u201d so the comparison to the transition from Obama to Trump doesn\u2019t work, he added. When pressed on how the Senate could look different because of the midterms, Cornyn pushed back. \u201cYes and the Earth could end tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good excuse for not doing our work.\u201d Democrats are obviously livid about this, but, much to their chagrin, there\u2019s nothing they can do. The news also has Senate Republicans feeling better about their decision to cancel most of the August recess. \u201cThat gives us the extra three or four weeks that we might not have had otherwise,\u201d said Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, who sits on the judiciary committee. The current breakdown in the Senate is 51 Republicans to 49 Democrats. With Arizona Republica Sen. John McCain out, that brings it down to 50-49, which means Republicans can\u2019t afford to lose a single vote. If any Democrats decide to vote with them, only then could Republicans afford to start losing some of their own. That doesn\u2019t matter anymore. During the Gorsuch confirmation, Republicans weren\u2019t getting enough Democrats to side with them and get the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster. So McConnell decided to go nuclear and change the rules so that Supreme Court nominees needed 50 votes. It was a huge deal at the time \u2013 and still is \u2013 but it was also seen as a retaliatory move, since Democrats had done the same thing a few years earlier with other executive branch nominees. On the Republican side, all eyes are on moderates Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. We\u2019ve already seen the power they can have in derailing GOP efforts, like when they helped take down a major health care vote last year, with McCain at their side. Murkowski and Collins both support abortion rights, so if Roe v. Wade becomes a big issue in this confirmation battle, that could turn the two of them off. Collins said Wednesday it was her \u201cpreference\u201d to nominate someone like Kennedy, who was a swing vote on the high court. \u201cOne of the things I most admire about him is that he did not view cases through an ideological lens but rather based on the law, the merits and the Constitution,\u201d Murkowski said. That brings us to another point: Like Collins said, many senators, especially Democrats, will be looking for a nominee who falls more in the middle in the ideological spectrum to replace Kennedy, since that is the role he played on the court as a key swing vote. Gorsuch was replacing Scalia, a conservative justice, so it wasn\u2019t such a big deal that Gorsuch was considered conservative. Picking a conservative to replace Kennedy could solidify the court as a right-leaning body for years to come. If Collins and Murkowski start to fade, all eyes will be on Democrats from red states who are up for re-election this year and facing enormous pressure back home. It could help them immensely for Trump to pick a more moderate nominee, but if he goes with a hardline conservative or a wild card, that would make it really tough for these Dems to sign on. In the Gorsuch confirmation, three of these Democrats (Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Joe Donnelly of Indiana) supported Gorsuch, but there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll back Trump\u2019s pick this time around. Speaking of, all five of the above mentioned senators \u2013 Collins, Murkowski, Manchin, Heitkamp, and Donnelly \u2013  met with the President \u2013 as well as with Grassley, the Iowa Republican and chairman of the committee that will hold the eventual nominee\u2019s confirmation hearing \u2013 on Thursday night, as the White House begins its full court press to nominate a new justice. Heitkamp, who Trump predicted just this week at a rally in Fargo would vote \u201cno\u201d to any pick he made \u2013 said following the meeting that she\u2019s still willing to hear him out on his court choice. \u201cPolitical speeches are just that, but the next day, I\u2019m ready to get to work. As I said, if the President wants to meet with me, I\u2019m ready to participate and advocate for North Dakota. And that\u2019s exactly what happened today,\u201d she said. Along with those three, it\u2019s also worth keeping an eye on seven other Democrats who are running for re-election in states that Trump won. They include: Of this group, GOP aides have their eyes primarily on McCaskill and Nelson, both of whom are tied in exceedingly tight races. Conservative groups spent millions on ads lobbying these senators to back Gorsuch last year, but only Manchin, Heitkamp and Donnelly ultimately backed him. But, as we mentioned before, this is now a court swinging, court defining pick. So several aides say it won\u2019t necessarily be viewed through the same vein Gorsuch was, when it was a conservative filling a conservative seat. So the pressure wasn\u2019t nearly as high on these red state Democrats. This story has been updated to include additional reporting.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump met with key senators at the White House on Thursday as the administration goes into a full-court press to nominate and confirm a new Supreme Court justice before the midterm elections next fall. Trump met with three red-state Democrats who are all facing tough re-election fights this year: Sens. Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly, of Indiana, and Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota. The meetings came a day after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced he\u2019ll retire on July 31. The White House plans to nominate a new justice by July 9, CNN reported earlier Thursday. Trump also met with Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, Susan Collins, of Maine, and Chuck Grassley, of Iowa. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump\u2019s team also talked with a dozen other senators. \u201cTonight President Trump met with Senators Grassley, Collins, Murkowski, Manchin, Donnelly, and Heitkamp to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThe President\u2019s team also talked with more than a dozen other Senators today as part of ongoing outreach to get views and advice from both sides of the aisle on this important nomination.\u201d All three Democratic senators are facing tough votes when Trump nominates a replacement for Kennedy. Their states went overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016 and a vote against the President\u2019s nominee to the court could end up costing them votes from Trump supporters they would have needed to stay in office. Heitkamp, who was previously praised by Trump as a \u201cgood woman\u201d before he campaigned against her in North Dakota on Wednesday, said following the meeting that she\u2019s still willing to hear him out on his court choice. \u201cPolitical speeches are just that, but the next day, I\u2019m ready to get to work. As I said, if the President wants to meet with me, I\u2019m ready to participate and advocate for North Dakota. And that\u2019s exactly what happened today,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Trump and I had a solid discussion about the Supreme Court vacancy. We also discussed how the administration\u2019s trade policies are hurting North Dakota\u2019s farmers and ranchers, the need for doctors throughout rural communities, the importance of filling the vacant seat on the US District Court of North Dakota and the impact of oil prices.\u201d Put more succinctly to CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny earlier this week, Heitkamp said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to say some mean things about me. That\u2019s OK. I\u2019m not a grudge carrier.\u201d Trump\u2019s meetings with Murkowski and Collins appear to be an attempt to shore up support within his own party. He\u2019ll need both of their votes to confirm his eventual nominee, given that Republicans have a slim 51-49 advantage in the upper chamber and Sen. John McCain is in his home state of Arizona fighting brain cancer. Murkowski and Collins have voted against Trump\u2019s agenda before, previously casting \u201cno\u201d votes that helped kill the \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of the Affordable Care Act in the summer of 2017. Both are pro-abortion rights Republicans, and their support for Trump\u2019s eventual nominee would not be assured if either were concerned that nominee could play a role in overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade case, which legalized abortion.  But both voted to confirm his last Supreme Court nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement from the Supreme Court has put the Senate on the cusp of an all-out war over his replacement and thrust an unexpected and hotly contested issue into the spotlight less than five months away from the midterm elections. Most Democrats and progressive groups are bracing for a generational battle, fearing that abortion rights, LGBT rights and the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage of those with pre-existing conditions will all be in jeopardy if President Donald Trump\u2019s eventual nominee is confirmed. Republicans, meanwhile, see the Supreme Court fight as a way to energize voters the party had feared would drift toward Democrats or sit out the midterms, by reminding them of the benefits of voting the GOP into power. With a 51-to-49 majority in the Senate and control of the White House, Republicans have the power to fill Kennedy\u2019s seat no matter what Democrats do to try to block Trump\u2019s nominee. \u201cWe have to pick a great one. We have to pick one that\u2019s going to be there for 40 years, 45 years,\u201d Trump told supporters at a campaign rally Wednesday night in North Dakota. What Anthony Kennedy's retirement means for abortion, same-sex marriage, affirmative action and the future of the Supreme Court But the battle could pose challenges to both parties in the near term, particularly Senate Democrats running for re-election in states Trump won in 2016. Those senators will have to decide between angering their party by voting for the President\u2019s nominee and giving Republicans a new opening to attack them ahead of the midterms by voting against Trump\u2019s choice. Already, some of the most vulnerable senators were avoiding taking positions on what had quickly become a rallying cry for most of their Democratic colleagues: that the confirmation vote be scheduled after the midterm elections. \u201cThere\u2019s a process we are going through. There\u2019s a decorum we should have. It\u2019s a shame when the place breaks down,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who is running for re-election in West Virginia, where Trump won by 42 points. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a red-state Democrat who has made working with Trump a cornerstone of her 2018 re-election campaign, distanced herself from some Democrats and suggested the President\u2019s nominee should get a vote before the midterm elections. \u201cI was taught that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right,\u201d Heitkamp said, a nod to the fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed voting on Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 pick for the court, until after the presidential election. Manchin and Heitkamp, along with Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, were the only Democrats to vote for Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Democrats call out GOP 'hypocrisy' amid SCOTUS retirement announcement For Republicans, meanwhile, a high-profile battle over abortion rights and health care could alienate women in particular and complicate their chances at holding Senate seats in swing states like Nevada and Arizona, as well as in the suburban battlegrounds that will determine control of the House. Rep. Jacky Rosen, the Democrat looking to unseat Republican Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada, a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, cast the fight as key to the \u201cfuture of the Supreme Court\u201d and knocked Heller as nothing more than a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for Trump who could \u201cjeopardize Roe v. Wade.\u201d For his part, Heller tried to cast the issue as a coming fight against \u201cobstructionist\u201d Democrats. \u201cThink of it this way \u2013 if there is another vacancy, who do you want picking the next Supreme Court Justice? President Trump and Senate Republicans or obstructionist Democrats,\u201d Heller said in a fundraising email sent shortly after Kennedy\u2019s retirement announcement. As Democratic senators weighed the politics surrounding Kennedy\u2019s replacement, progressive activists and other arms of the Democratic Party prepared for a massive fight that could ripple through elections in 2018 and 2020. McConnell: 'We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy's successor this fall' Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said Kennedy\u2019s retirement should \u201cremove all doubt\u201d about the importance of November\u2019s midterms, while outsiders began to debate how Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a new York Democrat who urged Republicans on Wednesday \u201cto follow the rule they set in 2016\u201d and \u201cnot to consider a Supreme Court justice in an election year,\u201d should direct his caucus. One organizer at a major progressive activist organization warned that simply calling out the GOP for hypocrisy wouldn\u2019t be enough to mobilize a grass roots that\u2019s been worn out by almost two years of near-daily political battles. \u201cIf we decide to make this a DC, think tank-first approach, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get our asses handed to us,\u201d the organizer said. \u201cThis fight can\u2019t be about (saying), \u2018This is not normal!\u2019 This is not normal!\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s not what this is. We need to lay out the stakes.\u201d But even then, Democrats, with only 49 votes if they stick together, would have to either convince a couple of Republicans to flip or consider extreme measures \u2013 potentially unprecedented acts of civil disobedience, one senior Democratic aide on the House side said \u2013 to block the nominee. Recent history suggests that, as with the brief government shutdown over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program earlier this year, Senate Democrats might not have the stomach for that brand of politics. Potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to wait until after the midterms to replace Kennedy. Democrats deem Supreme Court 'an arm of the Republican Party' after recent decisions \u201cThis Supreme Court vacancy puts issues that affect every single American in the balance, from a woman\u2019s constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions to privacy, equality and civil rights,\u201d Harris tweeted. \u201cI hope that my Republican colleagues who believe that women, not the government, have the right to control their bodies will stand with those of us who oppose any nominee who would deny women the right to choose,\u201d said independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Adam Jentleson, a former Harry Reid aide, tweeted that the most important question is whether Democrats \u201chave the will to fight against overturning Roe v. Wade in an election year where women are driving Dems\u2019 strength.\u201d Jentleson tweeted that he doesn\u2019t know how red-state Democrats will vote, \u201cbut this is definitional.\u201d \u201cAny Democrat who votes for Trump\u2019s nominee (assuming it\u2019s someone from his list of 25) will be voting to overturn Roe v. Wade.\u201d On the other side of the aisle, Republicans were gleeful at the prospect of moving from Kennedy \u2013 a swing vote on the Supreme Court \u2013 to a Neil Gorsuch-style conservative who would cement a five-vote majority for potentially decades to come. Americans think the Supreme Court nomination process is way too partisan \u201cI think that\u2019s the one thing energizes conservatives more than anything else, is the Supreme Court,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. A Republican involved in Senate races said Democrats will have to choose between a base that wants a big fight against Trump\u2019s nominee and moderate voters in their states. That Republican called Kennedy\u2019s retirement \u201ca majority saver.\u201d The Koch brothers\u2019 political network was also revving for battle. Sarah Field, the vice president of judicial strategy for Americans for Prosperity, told CNN the group will spend \u201cseven figures on the fight.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve essentially been spending the last six months preparing for this moment, working with activists and connecting them with what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Field said. Still, the fight could hurt Republicans in states with more Democratic or moderate electorates, like Nevada and Arizona. It could also prove damaging in House races, particularly in suburban districts, including 23 currently held by Republicans where Clinton won in 2016. The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undercut Obamacare\u2019s health care protections for those with pre-existing conditions are the subject of a legal battle, and a Democrat working on House races said the Supreme Court fight makes it easier for Democratic candidates to connect the courts to health care.",

            "article_content": "Name a major political issue from the past few decades, and chances are that Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the landmark decision on it during his time on the Supreme Court. Since his ascension to the court in 1988, Kennedy has authored some of the judicial body\u2019s biggest rulings of the past few decades, for both conservative and liberal positions. Here\u2019s a look at five of those decisions that deeply impacted the course of America\u2019s political, cultural and social life. Upheld right to abortion, with restrictions In a rare triple-byline, Kennedy co-authored with Justices Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and David Souter an opinion reaffirming the right to abortion as guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. The opinion angered conservatives while allowing restrictions that reproductive rights groups are still fighting today. The opinion stemmed from a lawsuit over changes to Pennsylvania\u2019s abortion control law in 1988 and 1989. The new version of the law included requirements of a 24-hour wait period, parental consent for minors, spousal notification and the disclosure of information by a physician (informed consent) before a woman could seek an abortion. These provisions were challenged by several abortion clinics and physicians, including Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, who sued Gov. Robert Casey. The court reaffirmed the right to abortion, but it upheld all the provisions except for spousal notification. The 5-4 decision also introduced the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard to determine if a state law imposes a \u201csubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\u201d Banned the death penalty for juveniles The death penalty case concerned Christopher Simmons, who committed capital murder when he was 17 years old and was sentenced to death. The question before the court was whether the death penalty, the government\u2019s harshest punishment, could be applied to those under 18. Justice Kennedy wrote the ruling in the 5-4 decision, saying that executing juveniles is cruel and unusual punishment banned by the Eighth Amendment. He argued that juveniles have developing minds and so are not beyond reform. \u201cWhen a juvenile offender commits a heinous crime, the State can exact forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut the State cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity.\u201d The decision was part of a series of decisions limiting the death penalty over the past two decades and came three years after Atkins v. Virginia, which ruled that executing the mentally disabled was unconstitutional. Rights for Guantanamo Bay detainees In a major ruling of the post-9/11 era, Kennedy wrote it is unconstitutional to prevent detainees from going before a judge and challenging their detention \u2013 known as the writ of habeas corpus \u2013 even if they are designated as enemy combatants or held in a different country. Boumediene v. Bush concerned a noncitizen who was held as an enemy combatant at the US-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. Boumediene argued that he and other petitioners were unconstitutionally denied the writ of habeas corpus. The government argued that the Military Commissions Act, passed by Congress in 2006, denied enemy combatants that right. Kennedy wrote for the majority opinion in the 5-4 decision. \u201cOur basic charter cannot be contracted away like this. The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cAbstaining from questions involving formal sovereignty and territorial governance is one thing. To hold the political branches have the power to switch the Constitution on or off at will is quite another.\u201d Ended limits on political spending The landmark campaign finance ruling paved the way for an unprecedented influx of outside money in electoral politics, such as in super PACs. The case began with Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation that wanted to advertise for a movie critical of Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2008 presidential election. However, federal law set strict limits on the ability of corporations and unions to spend and attempt to influence elections. The case pit campaign finance restrictions against Citizens United\u2019s claim that businesses have First Amendment free speech rights. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Kennedy sided with the company and struck down limits on independent campaign spending by corporations and unions. \u201cWhen government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought,\u201d Kennedy wrote for the majority. \u201cThe First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.\u201d Legalized gay marriage Kennedy authored the historic opinion that established a new civil right for same-sex couples to marry nationwide. Groups of same-sex couples in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee sued their relevant state agencies to challenge the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriage or the refusal to recognize legal same-sex marriages. The plaintiffs claimed that the statutes violated the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. One couple also brought claims under the Civil Rights Act. In all the cases, the trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs, but the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed those decisions. The appeal of Jim Obergefell of Ohio, whose husband died of ALS before the case was heard, and three others were consolidated for the high court. In an opinion equal parts jurisprudence and poetry, the court held that the right to marry is one of the fundamental liberties protected by Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, one that applies to same-sex couples just as it does to everyone else. \u201cNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,\u201d Kennedy wrote in the 5-4 ruling. \u201cIn forming a marital union, two people become something greater than they once were.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who provided key votes for same sex-marriage, abortion access and affirmative action, will retire from the Supreme Court. Anthony Kennedy didn't save the liberals The retirement is effective July 31, Kennedy said in a letter to President Donald Trump on Wednesday. Kennedy\u2019s decision to step down could transform the Supreme Court for generations. Trump will have his second opportunity to nominate a justice and will likely replace Kennedy with a young, conservative jurist. That would create a bloc of five staunch conservative justices who could move the court further to the right and cement a conservative majority for the foreseeable future. The nomination battle will likely ignite a firestorm on Capitol Hill as it comes just a year after Republicans changed the rules of the Senate in order to push through the nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first nominee. Trump said he has held Kennedy in high esteem, and that a search for a replacement will begin immediately. \u201cHe\u2019s been a great justice of the Supreme Court,\u201d Trump said, later adding, \u201cHe is a man who\u2019s displayed great vision, he\u2019s displayed tremendous vision.\u201d Trump and Kennedy met shortly before the announcement was made. \u201c(We) had a very deep discussion. I got his ideas on things,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. \u201cI asked him if he had certain people he had great respect for that could potentially take his seat.\u201d Here are potential contenders to replace Justice Kennedy Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016 until the presidential election was held, paving the way for Gorsuch, said the Senate will move quickly. \u201cWe will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy\u2019s successor this fall,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday. The court opening is also likely to drastically alter both parties\u2019 approaches to November\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans, in particular, hope the vacancy activates a base that the party has worried would sit out this year\u2019s contests. The timing couldn\u2019t be worse for the five Democratic senators up for re-election in states Trump won by double digits: Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. If those five vote against Trump\u2019s nominee, they\u2019ll hand Republicans a potent issue to hammer them with. If they vote for the nominee, they risk severe retribution from within the Democratic Party. Recalling McConnell\u2019s action, Democrats have begun calling for a delay until after the midterms. \u201cSen. McConnell set the new standard by giving the American people their say in the upcoming election before Court vacancies are filled,\u201d said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin. \u201cWith so much at stake for the people of our country, the US Senate must be consistent and consider the President\u2019s nominee once the new Congress is seated in January.\u201d \u201cMillions of people are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the President\u2019s nominee, and their voices deserve to be heard now, as leader McConnell thought they should deserve to be heard then,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York. \u201cAnything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy.\u201d Kennedy, 81, controlled the outcome of cases on hot-button issues like no other justice in recent history, as he often was the \u201cswing vote\u201d between the four liberal justices and the four more conservative justices. A Ronald Reagan appointee who took the bench in 1988, Kennedy\u2019s most lasting legacy will most likely be in the area of gay rights. In 2015, in it was Kennedy who penned Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark opinion that cleared  the way for same-sex marriage nationwide. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy \u201cThey ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Personal dignity and liberty are constant themes in Kennedy\u2019s jurisprudence as well as the limitation of federal power over the sovereignty of the states. Kennedy disliked the label of \u201cswing vote,\u201d but he did side with his conservative colleagues on issues such as campaign finance, gun control and voting rights. He also cast a vote with conservatives in Bush v. Gore, the 2000 case on disputed electoral results that cleared the way for the presidency of George W. Bush. Kennedy authored the majority opinion in Citizens United v. FEC striking down election spending limits for corporations and unions in support of individual candidates \u2013 an opinion that liberals and Democrats on the campaign trail vowed to overturn. To the dismay of conservatives, however, he joined the liberals on the court in other areas. Kennedy voted to reaffirm the core holding of Roe v. Wade in 1992, only to vote to uphold a federal ban on a particular abortion procedure in 2007. Nine years later, he sided once again with the liberals on the court to strike down a Texas law that abortion rights supporters thought was the strictest nationwide. Without Kennedy\u2019s vote, the law would have been allowed to go into effect, inspiring other states to pass similar legislation. In the same term, Kennedy pivoted on the issue of affirmative action when he voted for the first time in favor of a race- conscious admissions plan at a public university. After that term, former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal said, \u201cIt is very much Justice Kennedy\u2019s court.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t understand how important his affirmative action opinion is without understanding his earlier jurisprudence,\u201d Katyal said. \u201cFor decades, he has been the court\u2019s most eloquent voice on the need to be color blind \u2013 why he changed his mind is something historians will debate for decades.\u201d Kennedy also wrote the decision striking down the death penalty for juvenile offenders in Roper v. Simmons. He reflected on his role in close decisions in a 2010 interview. \u201cIf the case is close 5-4 and let\u2019s say you are on the side that prevailed with the majority, there are not a lot of high-fives and back slaps. There is a moment of quiet, a moment of respect, maybe even sometimes awe in the process.  We realize that one of us is going to have to write out a decision which teaches and gives reasons for what we do.\u201d Trump Wednesday said he would select a replacement from the list of possible justices that he released during his campaign. \u201cWe have a very excellent list of great, talented, highly educated, highly intelligent, hopefully tremendous people,\u201d he said in the Oval Office. \u201cI think you see the kind of quality that we\u2019re looking at when we look at that list.\u201d Possible top-tier candidates include Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Judge Raymond M. Kethledge of the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, who are both former clerks of Kennedy. Judge Thomas Hardiman of the 3rd Circuit was interviewed by the President as a runner-up for the Antonin Scalia seat. Also in the mix are  individuals who Trump has already nominated for lower court seats. That includes Judges Amul Thapar and Joan Larsen, who sit on the 6th Circuit. Thapar has the support of Senate GOP leader McConnell. Another potential is Amy Coney Barrett, who Trump nominated for a seat on the 7th Circuit. And a wildcard is Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee, a conservative who was on Trump\u2019s list. READ: Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement letter Asked if he\u2019d be interested in the job Wednesday, Lee noted that he \u201cstarted watching Supreme Court arguments for fun when I was 10 years old.\u201d \u201cI would not say no,\u201d Lee said. Although for many years Kennedy served as the most important vote on the court, he was only the third choice of President Reagan in 1987. The Senate rejected Robert Bork after contentious hearings. Judge Douglas Ginsburg dropped out after admitting he had smoked marijuana when he served as a law professor for Harvard. But Reagan praised his choice when he introduced him to the country, calling Kennedy \u201cthat special kind of American who\u2019s always been there when we needed leadership.\u201d Like Reagan, Kennedy lived his early life in California. He was a Catholic who was raised in a Republican family in Sacramento, and attended Stanford and Harvard Law School. Kennedy is married to Mary Davis, and has three adult children. This story is breaking and will be updated. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that his chamber will work to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy before the midterms, a decision filled with political ramifications across Capitol Hill and the nation. \u201cWe will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy\u2019s successor this fall,\u201d he said while speaking on the Senate floor immediately after the news. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made clear in a series of tweets, and on the floor, he wants to wait until after the midterm election, a precedent he says was originally set by McConnell in 2016. \u201cMy @SenateGOP colleagues should follow the rule they set in 2016 not to consider a SCOTUS nominee in an election year. Sen McConnell would tell anyone who listened that the Senate had the right to advise & consent, & that was every bit as important as POTUS\u2019 right to nominate,\u201d he tweeted. It\u2019s unclear what Democrats can do to stop Republican plans \u2013 besides attempts to apply political pressure on the opposing party \u2013 given the Senate rule change that allows Supreme Court justices to be approved by a simple majority. That means Democrats, who only control 49 seats in the chamber, may not be needed to advance the nomination. Kennedy, who provided key votes for same-sex marriage, abortion access and affirmative action, had announced hours earlier Wednesday his plans to retire from the Supreme Court. The retirement is effective July 31, Kennedy said in a letter to President Donald Trump. The weight of Kennedy\u2019s decision to step down is not lost on the senators, as the President\u2019s decision on a successor could transform the Supreme Court for generations. The question emerging now in the Senate is whether Democrats will put up a fight to block the confirmation of a Trump nominated judge. Democratic senators signal the process to replace Kennedy might not be as easy as Republican leadership hope for it to be ahead of a midterm where a third of the Senate is up for re-election, though what specific steps they can take to halt the nomination remain unclear. Republicans want such a vote now Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican whose committee will handle the successor\u2019s confirmation hearing, praised Kennedy\u2019s legacy in a statement, also saying he expects the nomination process to begin \u201csoon.\u201d \u201cFor more than three decades, Justice Kennedy served with great distinction on the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cI expect the President will soon nominate someone for the Senate to consider. I encourage the President to choose a nominee with the credentials, intellect and commitment to the rule of law necessary to serve on the Supreme Court.\u201d He added: \u201cI look forward to having the nominee before us in the Senate Judiciary Committee for his or her hearing in the weeks ahead.\u201d Majority Whip John Cornyn, who learned the news from reporters at Capitol Hill, said the process of replacing Kennedy \u201cenergizes\u201d conservatives. \u201cMcConnell will make it a priority,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing (that) energizes conservatives more than anything else, is the Supreme Court.\u201d He added: \u201cMy sense is we will be very busy after the President nominates his successor.\u201d Fellow Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz called the moment to replace Kennedy an \u201copportunity\u201d for Republicans, who have the majority in the Senate, to choose someone who represents their values. \u201cJustice Kennedy\u2019s retirement presents an opportunity for the President to appoint and the Senate to confirm a principled constitutionalist who will defend the Bill of Rights, defend the fundamental liberties of Americans, and I am hopeful that is exactly that will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident we will take up and confirm the nominee this year before the election.\u201d A Republican involved with Senate races says the Kennedy retirement is going to reshape the midterm dynamics by energizing conservatives and squeezing red-state Democrats, who will have to choose between a base that will want a big fight and more moderate voters. The source called the retirement \u201ca majority saver.\u201d In a rare hallway interview, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee told reporters that Kennedy\u2019s retirement is \u201cbig news\u201d and as a lifelong watcher of the court, he\u2019s very interested in what comes next. Asked if he\u2019d be interested in the job, Lee noted that he \u201cstarted watching Supreme Court arguments for fun when I was 10 years old.\u201d If asked to consider it, Lee responded: \u201cI would not say no.\u201d Trump said he would select a replacement from the list of possible justices that he released during his campaign. \u201cWe have a very excellent list of great, talented, highly educated, highly intelligent, hopefully tremendous people,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday after the news. \u201cI think you see the kind of quality that we\u2019re looking at when we look at that list.\u201d Minority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in a statement that McConnell set a standard in 2016 after the late Antonin Scalia\u2019s death that he wants to follow \u2013 waiting until after a major election to decide on a replacement. \u201cSenator McConnell set the new standard by giving the American people their say in the upcoming election before Court vacancies are filled,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWith so much at stake for the people of our country, the US Senate must be consistent and consider the President\u2019s nominee once the new Congress is seated in January.\u201d And he\u2019s not the only one. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, agreed with leadership in a statement that there shouldn\u2019t be a vote on a replacement until after the midterms. \u201cWe\u2019re now four months away from an election to determine the party that will control the Senate,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cThere should be no consideration of a Supreme Court nominee until the American people have a chance to weigh in. Leader McConnell set that standard in 2016 when he denied Judge Garland a hearing for nearly a year, and the Senate should follow the McConnell Standard.\u201d Besides Feinstein, Sens. Patty Murray, Mazie Hirono and Chris Murphy have said they hope for the same. When asked about Democrats wanting to wait until after the election, Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said this year is different than an election year. \u201cI think we should just move ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a different situation \u2026 it was close to a presidential election .. but this is not close (to a presidential election).\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Kevin Liptak, Kristin Wilson and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Republican appointee who provided key swing votes for same-sex marriage, abortion access and affirmative action, has announced his retirement from the Supreme Court. This decision will affect the court for a long time to come as President Donald Trump will have his second chance to nominate a justice in less than two years in office. This time, Republicans who control the Senate may try to speed up the process, to get a nominee seated before midterm elections in November. It would be a switch from the last year of the Barack Obama presidency, when Republicans slowed down the process to block Obama\u2019s nominee. No wonder Americans think the process is too political. Anthony Kennedy didn't save the liberals A large majority of respondents to a spring 2017 Quinnipiac poll, taken just after Trump\u2019s first nominee, Neil Gorsuch, was confirmed,said the process of confirming Supreme Court justices has become too partisan \u2013 with 68% saying so, compared with 13% who said it\u2019s the \u201cright amount\u201d of partisanship. All partisan groups showed a majority saying it has become too partisan \u2013 62% of Republicans and 71% of Democrats and independents. But Republicans were twice as likely to say it\u2019s the right amount of partisan \u2013 22% to Democrats\u2019 11% and independents\u2019 10%. In February of that year, a majority (56%) said Republicans were wrong to block Obama\u2019s nominee. But a majority (65%) also said Democrats would be wrong to not allow a vote on Gorsuch. Democrats did try to filibuster Gorsuch, a staunch conservative, by the way, so Republicans changed Senate rules to get him on the bench. Democrats deem Supreme Court 'an arm of the Republican Party' after recent decisions Who should Trump pick this time? His list of possible nominees is full of conservatives. According to a Gallup poll taken in September 2017, 43% of Americans said the current Supreme Court is just about right, while 30% said it was too conservative and 23% reported it was too liberal. The Gallup poll on the Supreme Court is taken once a year and the numbers from September 2016 have almost completely flipped on partisanship. Before the 2016 presidential election and when Obama was still in office, 37% said the court was too liberal and 20% said it was too conservative. In the past, how conservative or liberal the public wanted a new justice to be didn\u2019t really depend on the party of the nominating president. In June 2005, 41%, a plurality, wanted President George W. Bush to nominate a more conservative justice. But that number went down in the next Gallup poll in September. During Obama\u2019s presidency, more people reported each year they wanted a more conservative justice than liberal or keeping the court as it was. A CBS poll asked in February 2017, before Gorsuch was nominated, if respondents wanted the next Supreme Court justice to be someone who is a liberal, a moderate or a conservative. This question is more likely to indicate what people expect and want from Trump, as it was taken during his presidency. Only 2-in-10 said they wanted a liberal justice, 36% a moderate and a third reported they wanted someone who is conservative.",

            "article_content": "Kanye West is on board to make America great again. The musician posted a slew of tweets in April, praising President Donald Trump calling him his \u201cbrother\u201d who shares his \u201cdragon energy.\u201d West also tweeted out a picture of a MAGA hat, which appears to be signed by Trump. \u201cThank you Kanye, very cool!\u201d Trump tweeted, linking to the musician\u2019s post on the social media platform from earlier in the day. Thank you Kanye, very cool! https://t.co/vRIC87M21X The tweets come one week after West rejoined the platform. But it\u2019s not the first time the rapper, who is married to Kim Kardashian, has been political. Kanye West on Trump: 'The mob can't make me not love him' In fact, West and Kardashian have been open about their political views and aspirations. But where do they lie on the political spectrum? Answer: It\u2019s complicated. Here\u2019s a condensed timeline of Kim and Kanye\u2019s top political moments over the last few years. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, West was among the handful of celebrities who appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cA Concert for Hurricane Relief,\u201d a fundraiser for victims. During the segment, West \u2013 who was standing alongside comedian Mike Myers \u2013 looked into the camera and said, \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people.\u201d Hey @KimKardashian--I hear you are undecided in the election. I can explain why you should vote for @MittRomney. Back in 2012, Trump tweeted a recommendation to his then-fellow reality TV star. \u201cHey @KimKardashian\u2013I hear you are undecided in the election,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI can explain why you should vote for @MittRomney.\u201d That same month, HuffPost reported Kardashian was Charlotte-bound for the Democratic National Convention, where she appeared at several DNC after parties. I got my selfie!!! I really loved hearing her speak & hearing her goals for our country! #HillaryForPresident pic.twitter.com/zGpdcGSZBD Kardashian posted a selfie in August of 2015 with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. West is also seen in the background of the photo. \u201cI got my selfie!!! I really loved hearing her speak & hearing her goals for our country! #HillaryForPresident.\u201d It was seemingly an endorsement at the time (more on that later). As CNN\u2019s Deena Zaru reported at the time, West announced a presidential bid back in 2015 while accepting the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I finna lose after this. It don\u2019t matter though, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about ideas. New ideas. People with ideas. People who believe in truth,\u201d West said. \u201cAnd yes, as you probably could\u2019ve guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020 to run for president.\u201d In an interview with Vanity Fair, West said he is \u201cdefinitely\u201d thinking about running for president in 2020. \u201cI sit in clubs and I\u2019m like, Wow, I\u2019ve got five years before I go and run for office and I\u2019ve got a lot of research to do, I\u2019ve got a lot of growing up to do,\u201d he said. However, he said he would prefer \u201cnot to run against someone.\u201d He praised GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who is now the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cWhen I run for president, I\u2019d prefer not to run against someone. I would be like \u2018I want to work with you.\u2019 As soon as I heard (Ben) Carson speak, I tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him. I was like this is the most brilliant guy,\u201d West said. Kardashian admitted she was \u201con the fence\u201d about who to vote for in the 2016 election in an interview with Wonderland Magazine. But she said after talking with Caitlyn Jenner \u2013 who has been an outspoken activist for transgender rights \u2013 she realized she \u201cstands with Hillary.\u201d She clarified the \u201con the fence\u201d remark in a lengthy post on her personal website. \u201cI had a long conversation with Caitlyn, who has always been open about her political views,\u201d she wrote on her website. \u201cand she encouraged me to do my research before making my decision and then vote for the candidate whose policies aligned with the things that matter most to me. And so that\u2019s what I did. I thought about the things that are so important to me that they outweigh everything else, such as gun control and protecting women\u2019s rights to safe and legal abortion.\u201d Jenner, who is a lifelong Republican, told radio host John Catsimatidis last year that she would consider running for Senate. During a performance in California, West declared he didn\u2019t cast a vote in the presidential election, but if he did, he \u201cwould have voted for Trump.\u201d \"I would've voted for Trump\" - @kanyewest pic.twitter.com/XtyUteCgUZ Some in the audience of the show, held at the SAP Center in San Jose, booed the singer. West met with then-President-elect Trump, after he was spotted arriving at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump spoke to reporters with West by his side, calling the rapper a \u201cgood man\u201d and telling journalists that they have been \u201cfriends for a long time.\u201d West was hospitalized for exhaustion later that month. \u201cThank you Mr. President,\u201d Kardashian wrote on Instagram in January of last year. \u201cYou will be missed!\u201d In a second photo with Obama \u2013 featuring her and West\u2019s daughter North \u2013 Kardashian wrote, \u201cWhat an era! I posted some amazing memories on my website/app! I can\u2019t wait to show these to my kids one day.\u201d A post shared by Kim Kardashian (@kimkardashian) She also posted a family photo, with West smiling and North crying. West and Kardashian were among the handful of celebrities who participated in March for our Lives in Washington DC. They brought their daughter North. I\u2019m so happy I got to share this moment with these two \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f . I hope North remembers this forever pic.twitter.com/wJRRAvW9tC Student survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida organized the nationwide march to protest gun violence. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I got to share this moment with these two,\u201d Kardashian tweeted. \u201cI hope North remembers this forever.\u201d Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in 2016 in Paris. In August of that year, she met with the families of people who were killed by gun violence Earlier this week, West raised eyebrows after posting nine videos of Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip \u201cDilbert.\u201d He also tweeted praise for conservative commentator Candace Owens. And then there were the supportive Trump tweets that came on Wednesday. West clarified on Twitter, \u201cMy wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don\u2019t agree with everything Trump does. I don\u2019t agree 100% with anyone but myself.\u201d Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing. pic.twitter.com/uOy4UJ41JF Kardashian West met with officials, including senior adviser Jared Kushner, at the White House on Wednesday, May 30, to discuss prison reform, CNN reported. Prison reform has been a key issue for Kushner. Kardashian West has advocated for a pardon for a low-level drug offender named Alice Marie Johnson, who has served more than 20 years in prison. Trump also tweeted a photo of Kardashian West\u2019s visit. \u201cGreat meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing,\u201d he wrote. In a two-part tweet, Kardashian West thanked the President for his time. \u201cI would like to thank President Trump for his time this afternoon. It is our hope that the President will grant clemency to Ms. Alice Marie Johnson who is serving a life sentence for a first-time, non-violent drug offense,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are optimistic about Ms. Johnson\u2019s future and hopeful that she \u2014and so many like her\u2014will get a second chance at life.\u201d One week later, Trump commuted Johnson\u2019s sentence.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders went all in for his 2016 Iowa state director Pete d\u2019Alessandro\u2019s congressional campaign. He endorsed d\u2019Alessandro in January, helped raise money for the bid, headlined a rally for him in February and narrated a television ad that first aired in May. But it wasn\u2019t enough. D\u2019Alessandro finished third in the state\u2019s Third Congressional District primary on Tuesday, having been outraised by both the winner, small business owner Cindy Axne, and second place finisher, Eddie Mauro. In an interview Tuesday, d\u2019Alessandro credited Sanders for paving the way for his campaign, which he said wouldn\u2019t have been possible \u2013 or lasted as long in what had been a deep and well-funded field \u2013 without the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d they launched two years ago. Before then, d\u2019Alessandro said, \u201cSomeone like me couldn\u2019t even be in the race. The fact that so many people like me are in these races throughout this country is actually the story. We\u2019re gonna win some, we\u2019re gonna lose some, but the story isn\u2019t necessarily about the win-loss score.\u201d In a statement early Wednesday morning, Sanders touted the work of Our Revolution, the political organization formed out of his presidential campaign, and its winners on Tuesday night, including a pair in the Hawkeye State. He also gave a nod to d\u2019Alessandro, who \u201cdespite being heavily outspent,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cran a great, grassroots campaign in Iowa. I am sorry he lost.\u201d It was also a disappointing night for Sanders ally Cathy Glasson, a nurse and union leader backed by Our Revolution who came up short in the gubernatorial contest, which was won overwhelmingly by businessman Fred Hubbell. The wealthy first-time candidate is now set to face off with Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who leads a GOP-dominated state government. \u201cThey are systematically dismantling the parts of government we need to work best, so they can fund tax giveaways to companies that don\u2019t need them,\u201d Hubbell said of Iowa Republicans in his victory speech Tuesday night in Des Moines. By carrying more than 35% of the vote, Hubbell clinched the nomination outright and avoided what might have been a fraught state convention contest. Glasson is on pace to place second after state Sen. Nate Boulton left the race late amid allegations of sexual misconduct. John Norris, who ran Jesse Jackson\u2019s 1988 primary campaign in Iowa, is due to finish third. Hubbell will take on the incumbent Reynolds, who is seeking a first full term \u2013 she assumed the job in 2017 when President Donald Trump made her predecessor, former Gov. Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China \u2013 in a contest that could tap into a range of issues with national implications. The Democrat, who has already given millions to his own campaign, is expected to target Reynolds, the state\u2019s first female governor, over her decision in May to sign a bill that would make Iowa home to what many describe as the country\u2019s most restrictive abortion law, while trying to drive a wedge between her and Republicans loyal to Trump, whose tariffs have unsettled the state\u2019s massive pork and soybean industries. Hubbell has also pledged to return Iowa Medicaid, which was privatized by Republicans, to state control and restore funding for Planned Parenthood. The Republican Governors Association welcomed Hubbell to the general election with a statement describing him as a \u201cliberal megadonor and longtime political insider\u201d who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have what it takes to lead.\u201d In the first district, state legislator Abby Finkenauer is line to become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress if she can oust Republican Rep. Rep. Rod Blum, whose seat the party has been eyeballing for months. Finkenauer, one of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s \u201cred to blue\u201d picks, was endorsed by a pair of potential 2020 presidential candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and California Rep. Eric Swalwell, along with EMILY\u2019s List, NARAL and leading labor groups. It wasn\u2019t all bad news Tuesday for Sanders loyalists. Our Revolution is on track for a win in the 4th district, where J.D. Scholten, a former professional baseball player, is hoping for a chance to unseat GOP Rep. Steve King. Scholten supports single-payer health care and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The group\u2019s endorsed candidate for secretary of state, Deidre DeJear, is also leading Jim Mowrer, an Iraq war veteran who challenged King unsuccessfully in 2014 and 2016. DeJear will face off with incumbent Republican Paul Pate, who ran unopposed.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans are announcing they\u2019re leaving office at a significantly faster rate than any other recent Congresses, suggesting Democrats could pick up seats in the 2018 midterm elections. Already, at least 44 House Republicans have announced they are retiring, running for another office or resigning outright, including Ryan. They\u2019re leaving from all over the map, from southern New Jersey to southern New Mexico. Democrats need to pick up 24 House seats to retake the majority from Republicans, who\u2019ve had control of the House since 2011. Republican leadership has acknowledged it has a problem. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find better ways to empower people where they feel like this is worth their time,\u201d Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, a former two-term National Republican Congressional Committee chair who met with several members to discuss retirements, told the National Journal in September. But the retirements kept coming. While midterm elections are historically tough for the party of the President in power, it\u2019s too early to tell how things will unfold this year. But seats are opening up all over. A few seats will be filled by special elections before next November. But most won\u2019t. The locations of some of these seats were pivotal during the push for health care reform and tax reform in 2017. Reps. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania were courted during the health care debates for their votes. Both have high numbers of Medicaid enrollees in their districts. Property taxes are high in New Jersey, and LoBiondo objected to the repeal of the state and local tax deduction during the tax reform debates. Some states are seeing higher numbers of open seats. And not all of the vacancies are coming from Republicans. Several vacancies opened in Texas, including the blue 16th Congressional District, won by Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke in 2016. He announced that he plans to run for the Senate in 2018. Seats have opened as a result of sexual harassment inquiries or accusations. Among Democrats, Reps. Ruben Kihuen of Nevada and John Conyers of Michigan announced they would leave Congress following pressure to resign, though Kihuen plans to finish his term. On the Republican side, Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona resigned and Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas announced he will resign, both following sexual harassment accusations. The campaign committees on both sides of the political aisle are eyeing the 23 Republicans defending districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and the 12 seats  held by Democrats in districts that President Donald Trump won. These are seen as vulnerable seats to flip. But many of the Republican retirements are occurring in districts where Trump narrowly carried the vote, like New Jersey\u2019s 2nd or Michigan\u2019s 11th. Members from these districts could have faced tough re-elections this year, when Democrats are expected to be strong performers, potentially regaining control of the House. Republicans who say they will run for other offices are more likely to come from districts where Trump performed well. These members vote in alignment with the President at a high rate. They may count on continued support from his base to propel them into higher office. With few exceptions, the Republicans and Democrats who are retiring largely vote along party lines. They also have levels of support for the President\u2019s agenda similar to those of their respective parties. Past research has found the emergence of \u201cstrategic retirement\u201d by politicians when they think re-election is less likely. The recent results in Virginia and subsequent Republican departures suggest this phenomenon may be in effect. Here is the full list of representatives  so far who have announced that they plan to leave office, broken down by whether they said they will resign, retire or run for another office. Some members resigned before their terms ended. While the number of Democrats and Republicans planning to run for another office is close in number, the number of House Republican retirements dwarfs those announced by Democrats. Members from either party planning to run for another office tend to run for Senate seats or governorships. Scandal has also led to some resignations. Rep. Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania announced he would retire after the anti-abortion GOP congressman admitted that he had had an affair and had urged an abortion.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is in campaign mode and he seemed to make a new pledge Tuesday night, saying he would offer some kind of new tax cuts before November. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be submitting additional tax cuts sometime prior to November,\u201d Trump said during a speech to the anti-abortion rights group Susan B. Anthony List. And that was it. No specifics. No more information. What happens in November? Midterm elections. Could the promise of new tax cuts excite the GOP base and help them ward off the anti-Trump fervor expected to drive Democrats to the voting booth? RELATED: 45% of tax filers will owe nothing in federal income tax this year The funny thing here is that Republicans just passed a massive and thorough slate of tax cuts, permanent for corporations and temporary for individuals. It was supposed to be a wholesale restructuring of the US tax code. And they didn\u2019t do it overnight. Even though Republicans had been licking their lips for years at the prospect of slashing corporate tax rates to give American businesses more room to grow, it took pretty much all of 2017 for them to get the job done. Two politicians just told the truth about taxes and health care Granted, they had no help from Democrats, but it was a tortured process in which they had to focus all their power on Capitol Hill. It wasn\u2019t easy. And it hasn\u2019t yet turned out to be very popular. RELATED: How businesses are really spending their tax cuts An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked if the Republican tax law was a good idea. Just 27% said it was. Thirty-six percent said it was a bad idea and 34% had no opinion. Republicans were the only partisan group in which a majority (56%) favored the law. Just 6% of Democrats and 26% of independents agreed. Granted, many of the benefits for individuals don\u2019t kick in until Americans file their taxes next April, but Republicans had clearly hoped that delivering on a long-stated promise of tax reform would pay off. So \u2013 putting aside the possibility that Trump is just trying to find a way to remind people about his great and only major legislative win \u2013 it\u2019s a little unclear why he would be vaguely proposing new tax cuts to be unveiled in tandem with Election Day. Which taxes, exactly, would be cut, and how would they be paid for? No, no one is stealing from Social Security Passing the first round of tax cuts is a move that is already giving budget hawks heartburn \u2013 though not enough to vote against it. The new tax law is slated to help push US deficits over $1 trillion as soon as 2020 and $2 trillion by 2028 unless or until the economy, which has been on a tear, grows even more to pay for them. Or the US government will have to further tighten its belt, cutting spending or reforming things like Social Security and Medicare, an effort which would lead to frustrations of its own. There is also some evidence of buyer\u2019s remorse on the cuts that already passed. And perhaps that\u2019s some of what\u2019s behind Trump\u2019s comments. There\u2019s more to do! Sen. Marco Rubio pointed out this tension in an interview with The Economist in early May when he implied the cuts arguably did more for corporations than for people. He later clarified they did a lot for people, too. Trump travels to the Indiana city some say Obama's economy helped save \u201cThere is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy, they\u2019re going to take the money they\u2019re saving and reinvest it in American workers,\u201d Rubio told The Economist. \u201cIn fact, they bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that the money\u2019s been massively poured back into the American worker.\u201d Americans remain bullish on the economy, however, and they trust Republicans more on that issue. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what exactly Trump meant and whether his comments are a precursor of a new tax cut effort, better than the old tax cut effort.",

            "article_content": "When Lucy McBath\u2019s phone began receiving alerts about the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, she felt angry and deeply hurt. \u201cI just thought, \u2018I\u2019m so sick of this. Those kids are the same age as Jordan and are being gunned down. Why are our legislators still playing games with human lives?\u2019,\u201d she says. Her only son, Jordan Davis, was killed in 2012 when Michael Dunn fired 10 bullets into a vehicle the 17-year-old was sitting in with friends at a gas station. \u201cI\u2019m looking beyond my own tragedy, looking at how many more people are suffering\u201d Lucy McBath Six years later, McBath\u2019s fight for justice and gun reform continues to evolve. As she connected with families of the Parkland school shooting victims in February and continued lobbying on behalf of the gun control group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense In America, McBath realized the massacre struck too close to home. She prayed to God for guidance about what she should do to help the students. Two days later, she decided to run for Congress. In March, McBath added her name to the Democratic primary ballot for Georgia\u2019s 6th \u2013 a district made up of northern Atlanta suburbs. On Tuesday, voters will decide which of the four Democrats will run against Republican Karen Handel in the general election in November. McBath stands out among her party opponents as the only person of color and the only woman. Kristin A. Goss, a public policy professor at Duke University who has been studying the gun debate since Columbine, says McBath\u2019s path to politics is not unusual. Former US Representative Carolyn McCarthy led the fight on the Democratic side of the aisle for years before retiring. She had been living a quiet life as a nurse in 1993 when a man killed six people on a Long Island commuter train, including her husband. The incident eventually led her successful election to Congress. McBath is also joining a wave of women across the US who are stepping up to run for school boards, city councils and state houses. Like her, many have lobbied for gun control laws. \u201cWhat many of our volunteers realize after visiting their state or federal lawmakers is that they are just as smart and capable,\u201d says Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action. Last year, nine women involved with the group ran for local and state office and were elected. This year, dozens more are following their footsteps, Watts says. McBath recalls sitting on a couch \u2013 some 1,000 miles away \u2013 crying and screaming after she learned that Jordan was killed. It was the day after Thanksgiving in 2012. She had been visiting family in Chicago when Jordan\u2019s father, Ron Davis \u2013 who he had lived with in Jacksonville, Florida \u2013 called to break the news. Jordan and three of his friends were on their way to the mall when they stopped at a gas station to get gum and cigarettes. Dunn was parked next to the teens\u2019 red Dodge Durango. He didn\u2019t like the loud music \u2013 \u201crap crap,\u201d as Dunn described it during his trial and asked them to turn it down. Shortly thereafter, he began shooting, striking Jordan three times. Jordan\u2019s death unleashed a whirlwind of events and helped revive the activist inside McBath, who had been living in Georgia since becoming a Delta flight attendant in the early 1990s. She started questioning lawmakers, the clergy and anybody who would listen. She appeared on TV telling her story, attended rallies and knocked on doors on Capitol Hill. \u201cOh my Gosh (sigh), my life today absolutely nothing resembles, in no way, shape or form my life before Jordan was murdered,\u201d she says. McBath also attended Dunn\u2019s trials, learned about gun control laws and met with other survivors. \u201cI began to notice that I was no longer interested in flying. When I would go to work my mind was everywhere else,\u201d she says. Two years after her son\u2019s death, Dunn was sentenced to life in prison without parole. A jury found him guilty on multiple charges, commanding at least 60 years in prison, but the jury was hung on the murder charge related to Davis\u2019 death. Dunn sought to use the controversial Stand Your Ground law as his defense, saying that Davis threatened him and that he thought he saw a gun sticking out the teenagers\u2019 SUV. Police found a basketball, sneakers, clothing, a camera tripod and cups inside the vehicle, but no gun. After a second trial, Dunn was convicted of first degree murder. Dunn\u2019s conviction gave McBath a \u201climited sense of justice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not enough justice won because I don\u2019t have my son, and two, because there\u2019s so many other people in this country that continue to die like him,\u201d she says. So she continued telling her story as a way to keep her son\u2019s name alive in people\u2019s minds even if it meant reliving her pain. \u201cFor me I was looking beyond my own tragedy, looking for the other tragedies that were most definitely going to happen if I didn\u2019t keep talking about this crisis,\u201d she says. And after nearly three decades as a flight attendant, she decided to retire in 2014 and became a national spokeswoman for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense In America. Since then, she has traveled around the country to speak with lawmakers, meet survivors of gun violence and even campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cMy sense of purpose before was raising my child and making sure that he had what he needed to become a successful human being,\u201d McBath says. \u201cNow, my purpose has shifted.\u201d In 1994, McBath had given up on ever having a child due to several miscarriages when her \u201cmiracle baby\u201d began growing inside her. \u201cI was very, very careful. Just didn\u2019t want to slip, didn\u2019t want to fall,\u201d McBath recalls. \u201cI did exactly as the doctor told me to do.\u201d She dedicated her life to raising Jordan. The curious boy with a great sense of humor loved learning about everything around him. He disliked math but loved history and social sciences, and he was the one friends went to for advice, she says. The killing of Trayvon Martin in February 2012, McBath says, forced her to have the talk with her son about how to live and survive as a young black male in America. \u201cI remember having that discussion with him telling him, \u2018Sweetheart, because you\u2019re a young black male. You know, there are a lot of people in this world, in this nation that don\u2019t value you,\u2019\u201d she recounted. \u201c\u2018And you have to be so careful where you go and what you do and who you talk to, because you know if you get into an altercation with anyone nowadays people will take their guns out, and they\u2019ll shoot you.\u2019\u201d Nine months later, he was shot and killed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to be quiet. I wanted everyone to know that Jordan was a good kid,\u201d she says. \u201cJordan didn\u2019t deserve to die that way.\u201d McBath says one of her biggest challenges to date began a few months ago. She had been campaigning for a seat in Georgia\u2019s House of Representatives \u2013 a race she felt comfortable in \u2013 when the Parkland shooting happened and in a leap of faith, she decided to run for Congress instead. McBath hopes to unseat Handel, who is seeking reelection to a full term after she edged out her Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, in a runoff election in 2017 that turned into the most expensive House race in history. More than $50 million was spent by both parties and super PACs. But McBath is prepared for the challenge. She\u2019s picked up endorsements from several gun control groups and EMILY\u2019s List, a political action committee that backs Democrats who support abortion rights. And while Jordan\u2019s death may have been the catalyst to her activism; politics and the fight for civil rights played an integral part of her youth. She was born in the Chicago suburb of Joliet, Illinois, and grew up traveling with her family to rallies around the state. As a teen she dreamed of attending law school or becoming a lobbyist. In college, she interned on Capitol Hill for the NAACP, and worked as an aide for then-Democratic state senator Douglas Wilder in Virginia. Since entering the race for Georgia\u2019s 6th congressional district, McBath has been forced to expand her knowledge and deep dive into foreign policy, healthcare and other topics being discussed out of the White House and Capitol Hill. \u201cI\u2019m learning very rapidly. I just feel like the pace has accelerated while I\u2019m running for office,\u201d she says. For Michael Owens, the Democratic Committee Chairman in Cobb County \u2013 on the western side of the 6th district \u2013 McBath\u2019s prominence in the national political round may contribute to keep the momentum going for Democrats in Georgia. \u201cLucy has the ability to connect with people. In a room full of people I think she can connect with people one-on-one,\u201d Owens said. Bobby Kaple, who quit his job as a local news anchor to enter the race, is centering his campaign around affordable healthcare and has declared his support for Obamacare. Kevin Abel, a businessman who immigrated from South Africa as a teenager, has criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s position on DACA and refugee settlements.  And Steven Knight Griffin, a former policy expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also left his job in the hopes of running against Handel. All of them support gun control laws but McBath has made it her campaign\u2019s top issue. \u201cThis is my life\u2019s mission, to make sure we put common sense solutions in our existing gun laws, beyond just making sure that people live the way our constitution says they are supposed to live,\u201d McBath says.",

            "article_content": "When Anthony Kennedy was sworn in at the White House in February 1988, President Ronald Reagan heartily congratulated new \u201cJustice Kennedy\u201d and quipped, \u201cSounds good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d It did and it has. Kennedy has always reveled in his place on the Supreme Court and his role interpreting the Constitution, which he proclaimed at that East Room ceremony 30 years ago \u201cthe single fact, the single reality, the singe idea, the single moral principle, that sets the United States apart from other nations now and throughout history.\u201d And that might be one reason the 81-year-old Kennedy, under a media microscope for any signs of an imminent retirement, decides not to step down at the end of the session in June. Often casting the deciding vote on this sharply divided court, Kennedy is evasive when asked about his plans. Yet he may be finding more reasons to stay than go, beginning with the fact that he has always lived for this. The Sacramento native who taught law school while serving first on a US appeals court has remained as animated about constitutional issues as he was when he approached the microphone 30 years ago with two thumbs up. He is known for his lofty rhetoric, sometimes drawing criticism from dissenting colleagues for being over-the-top. Elevated references to individual dignity and equality marked his opinions as he broke ground on gay rights and same-sex marriage over the years. But even this week in a car-search dispute, Kennedy spoke grandly: \u201cFew protections are as essential to individual liberty as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The Framers made that right explicit in the Bill of Rights following their experience with the indignities and invasions of privacy.\u201d In opinions and in speeches, Kennedy rarely passes up a chance to hail the document that he still holds up as defining America. Kennedy, a centrist conservative, is more than \u201cthe decider,\u201d as he has been dubbed because he often casts the crucial fifth vote on the nine-member bench. He writes many of the most consequential opinions. This longest serving sitting justice is second in rank only to Chief Justice John Roberts. When Kennedy joins the four liberals for a majority decision, his seniority give him the power to assign the opinion. He routinely keeps the case for himself. When he aligns with the four conservatives (Roberts included), Kennedy\u2019s vote is usually needed to hold the majority. So Roberts often assigns him the opinion to ensure that he stays with that fivesome and is not dissuaded by the reasoning of a justice further to the right. Kennedy is more relevant now than if President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland had been confirmed in 2016, or if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had won the election and in 2017 filled the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. (Scalia died in February 2016, and the court was at eight justices for more than a year.) It was during this period that Kennedy began seriously mulling retirement. He was nearing 80 yet perhaps also thinking that the addition of a fifth liberal would diminish the force of his centrism. When Donald Trump won the election and then chose conservative Neil Gorsuch, Kennedy regained his place in the middle. The Supreme Court could be entering an especially significant era, with Trump forging a new legal agenda and poised for confrontations with special counsel Robert Mueller, investigating any Trump campaign connection to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. The justices might have to resolve whether a president could be forced to testify before a grand jury or could be indicted at some point. Such possibilities are even more speculative than what might be in the mind of the often-vacillating Kennedy. Still, large constitutional questions loom, and Kennedy might want to be there. Justices, appointed for life, resist retirement. Two of the last five justices to leave the bench died in office. William Rehnquist thought he could survive another year with thyroid cancer but succumbed to the disease at age 80 in September 2005. Scalia died while on a hunting trip in February 2016, just weeks from turning 80. When Justice John Paul Stevens stepped down in 2010, he was 90. Breaking the pattern, Justice David Souter left the bench in 2009 at the relatively youthful age of 69. He was eager to return to a quieter life in his home state of New Hampshire. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor retired in early 2006, at 75, with mixed feelings, to take care of her ailing husband. Kennedy\u2019s feelings on whether he stays or goes are difficult to predict. When he tackles cases, he weighs multiple options and sometimes wrings his hands even after he has decided. In 1992, for instance, when he cast the deciding vote to reaffirm a woman\u2019s right to abortion, Kennedy told a reporter from California Lawyer magazine just before the case was to be announced: \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re Caesar crossing the Rubicon or Captain Queeg cutting your own tow line.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Comedian Michelle Wolf\u2019s savage takedown of everyone from President Donald Trump to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders to the media was  \u2013 and will be \u2013 the talk of Saturday Night\u2019s White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in Washington. Some \u2013 mostly on the left \u2013 saw it is a speak-truth-to-power moment \u00e0 la Stephen Colbert\u2019s speech at the 2006 White House correspondents\u2019 dinner.  Others \u2013 mostly on the right \u2013 viewed it as a vile, hate-filled address that was neither funny nor appropriate. Most journalists in the room \u2013 and I was among them \u2013 were largely quiet during Wolf\u2019s speech, particularly the second half when she got very personal about Sanders. (No, this does not mean journalists are humorless or can\u2019t laugh at themselves \u2013 so save it.) I took a bunch of my notes on my phone during Wolf\u2019s speech. I thought I\u2019d share them \u2013 and expand on them \u2013 here. These are in no order other than how they occurred to me. (You can watch the whole speech yourself here.) Wolf had zero interest in playing to the room Introducing the \u201cDaily Show\u201d comic, White House Correspondents\u2019 Association President Margaret Talev praised Wolf as someone who was very much not part of the world of Washington. That was seen as a good thing, given that the criticism of Washington and its denizens since the election of Trump is that they/we are deeply out of touch with normal Americans. (A coastal comedian is not exactly \u201cregular\u201d people, but whatever.) I wonder whether Talev thought Wolf\u2019s I-could-care-less-about-any-of-you approach was such a great idea after the comedian\u2019s speech. Most comedians who speak at the correspondents\u2019 dinner take a fair number of shots at the attendees in the room. But they also play along with theme of the night, which attempts to be a celebration of the free and independent media as well as a chance to shine a light on some of the best journalists in the country. Wolf didn\u2019t do that. She wanted to napalm the room. And she did. Unapologetically. Wolf went for lots of low-hanging fruit There are LOTS of way to go after Sanders. I personally think that she is overly antagonistic to the reporters who cover the White House and misleads on the regular. But to make fun of Sanders\u2019 makeup? (\u201cI think she\u2019s very resourceful, like she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye. Maybe she\u2019s born with it, maybe it\u2019s lies,\u201d said Wolf.) Like, really? I know lots of liberals will \u2013 and already have via Twitter \u2013 painted the attacks on Sanders as the press secretary getting what she deserved. I don\u2019t subscribe to that idea. Sanders showed up, sat on the dais and played along. She knew she was likely to get made fun of. But she would have no reasonable expectation that Wolf would go after her looks and refer to her as an \u201cUncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women.\u201d I\u2019m stunned that Sanders sat five feet away from Wolf and just took it. Being funny is one thing. Bullying people because you can is another. And Wolf\u2019s treatment of Sanders was bullying. And, yes, by the way, Trump is a massive bully. Making fun of a disabled reporter, stereotyping ethnic groups, attacking reporters for how they look \u2013 all of that stuff is totally and completely unacceptable. And he knows exactly what he is doing, which makes it worse. But two wrongs don\u2019t make it right. Because Trump bullied a disabled reporter doesn\u2019t mean Wolf should be able to bully Sarah Sanders. Bullying is bullying. And it\u2019s wrong. Always. Wolf\u2019s criticism of the media was (generally) on point The most powerful line of Wolf\u2019s speech, which will inevitably get overshadowed by what she said about Sanders, was this on the media and Trump: \u201cHe has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.\u201d The first sentence there is 100% right. It is absolutely beyond debate that Trump has been good for the news business. The amount of news he creates coupled with the number of people who consume news about him has made cable news and print media more relevant (and profitable) than ever before. The second sentence I take some issue with. Yes, cable ran Trump\u2019s primary speeches because he said and did things that no one else would do \u2013 and that people would watch. And, yes, when I was at The Washington Post, I wrote about Trump regularly because he said and did things that no one else did. But that, to me, is different than \u201ccreating\u201d Trump. Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy was formed and sharpened by an angry and embittered GOP electorate who was sick of their own party, of Washington, of the media, of everything. He was rising whether the media covered him wall to wall or not; he was the angry id of the GOP. The media didn\u2019t create that. The abortion stuff was beyond the pale Here\u2019s Wolf\u2019s joke about Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s opposition to abortion: \u201cHe thinks abortion is murder which, first of all, don\u2019t knock it \u2018til you try it \u2014 and when you do try it, really knock it. You know, you\u2019ve got to get that baby out of there.\u201d Does anyone think this joke is funny? You can hate abortion and think it is murder. You can feel as though it\u2019s not the government\u2019s business what you do with your body and how you handle your own life.  But, does anyone celebrate abortion \u2013 even jokingly? Wolf got exactly what she wanted Don\u2019t be fooled: Wolf knew exactly what she was doing on Saturday night. She knew that the speech \u2013 at least in parts \u2013 was likely to go over like a lead balloon in the room. And that it would stir huge amounts of controversy in its wake. THAT WAS THE POINT. Ask yourself this: Did the average person know who Wolf was before Saturday night? (I will admit, I did not. And, yes, I know Wolf had never heard of me either.) Search interest in her soared last night and continued to spike Sunday morning, according to Google Trends. She is the talk of every Sunday talk show. She will be a regular topic on cable TV \u2013 and late-night TV \u2013 this week. On a related note, her Netflix series, \u201cThe Break With Michelle Wolf\u201d \u2013 comes on May 27. She couldn\u2019t buy better publicity for that show than she got with her speech on Saturday night.",

            "article_content": "Barbara Bush, the matriarch of a Republican political dynasty and a first lady who elevated the cause of literacy, died Tuesday, according to a statement from her husband\u2019s office. She was 92. Only the second woman in American history to have had a husband and a son elected President (Abigail Adams was the first), Bush was seen as a plainspoken public figure who was instantly recognizable with her signature white hair and pearl necklaces and earrings. She became a major political figure as her husband, George H.W. Bush, rose to become vice president and president. After they left the White House, she was a potent spokeswoman for two of her sons \u2013 George W. and Jeb \u2013 as they campaigned for office. 'The enforcer' -- how Barbara Bush became the matriarch of the Republican Party The mother of six children \u2013 one of whom, a daughter, Robin, died as a child from leukemia \u2013 Barbara Bush raised her fast-growing family in the 1950s and \u201960s amid the post-war boom of Texas and the whirl of politics that consumed her husband. She was at his side during his nearly 30-year political career. He was a US representative for Texas, UN ambassador, Republican Party chairman, ambassador to China and CIA director. He then became Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice president for two terms and won election to the White House in 1988. He left office in 1993 after losing a re-election bid to Bill Clinton. Quick-witted with a sharp tongue, the feisty Barbara Bush was a fierce defender of her husband and an astute adviser. As first lady, her principal persona as a devoted wife and mother contrasted in many ways with her peer and predecessor, Nancy Reagan, and her younger successor, Hillary Clinton, both of whom were seen as more intimately involved in their husbands\u2019 presidencies. Tributes pour in for 'force of a woman' Barbara Bush Still, Barbara Bush promoted women\u2019s rights, and her strong personal views sometimes surfaced publicly and raised eyebrows \u2013 especially when they clashed with Republican Party politics. For instance, she once said as her husband ran for president that abortion should not be politicized. She also was not shy about the possibility of a female president, disarming a Wellesley College audience at a 1990 appearance protested by some on campus who questioned her credentials to address female graduates aiming for the workplace. \u201cSomewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow my footsteps and preside over the White House as the president\u2019s spouse. \u201cI wish him well,\u201d she said. Barbara Pierce was born June 8, 1925, in New York and raised in the upscale town of Rye. She attended a prestigious boarding school in South Carolina, where she met her future husband at a school dance when she was only 16 and he was a year older. A year and a half and countless love letters later, the two were engaged just before George Bush enlisted in the Navy and went off to fight in World War II. Bush, who was the youngest fighter pilot in the Navy at the time, would return home a war hero, after being shot down by the Japanese. He had flown 58 combat missions and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery. By that time, Barbara had dropped out of Smith College and the pair were married in January 1945. They raised their family mainly in Texas, where George H.W. Bush, the son of a US senator, was in the oil business and later entered politics. Barbara Bush\u2019s dedication to keeping order at home earned her the nickname \u201cthe enforcer.\u201d Barbara Bush Fast Facts \u201cWe were rambunctious a lot, pretty independent-minded kids, and, you know, she had her hands. Dad, of course, was available, but he was a busy guy. And he was on the road a lot in his businesses and obviously on the road a lot when he was campaigning. And so Mother was there to maintain order and discipline. She was the sergeant,\u201d George W. Bush told CNN in 2016. With her husband as vice president in the 1980s, Bush adopted literacy as a cause, raising awareness and eventually launching the nonprofit Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. After George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidency, he and Barbara raised more than $1 billion for literacy and cancer charities. \u201cI chose literacy because I honestly believe that if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society,\u201d she said. A writer, her books include an autobiography and one about post-White House life. Her children\u2019s book about their dog, Millie, and her puppies written during her White House years was, as were her other books, a bestseller. In 2001, when George W. Bush took office, Barbara Bush became the only woman in American history to live to see her husband and son elected president. She campaigned for son George W. and fiercely defended him from critics after he became president. Asked in a 2013 interview about the prospect that her younger son, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, might mount a White House campaign in 2016, Bush quipped in her dry fashion, \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough Bushes.\u201d But when Jeb decided to run, she changed her mind and campaigned for him, appearing in a video for Jeb Bush\u2019s ultimately unsuccessful campaign, saying, \u201cI think he\u2019ll be a great president.\u201d She also was outspoken about Donald Trump. In one of her last interviews, the former first lady said in early 2016 she was \u201csick\u201d of Trump, who belittled her son repeatedly during the 2016 GOP primary campaign, adding that she doesn\u2019t \u201cunderstand why people are for him.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a woman,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about what he says about women.\u201d Most recently, Bush published a note in the spring edition of Smith College\u2019s alumnae magazine, where she declared: \u201cI am still old and still in love with the man I married 72 years ago.\u201d The college awarded Bush an honorary degree in 1989. Bush battled health problems for much of her later life. She was diagnosed in 1988 with Graves\u2019 disease, an autoimmune disease that commonly affects the thyroid. She had open-heart surgery in 2009 and in 2008 underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer. In her final years, she was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, better known as COPD, as well as congestive heart failure. But, along with her husband, she kept an active public schedule, raising money for charity. Bush is survived by her husband, George H.W.; sons George W., Neil, Marvin and Jeb; daughter, Dorothy Bush Koch; and 17 grandchildren.

            "article_content": "Nearly one month after his upset victory in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District special election, Democrat Conor Lamb was sworn into the House of Representatives on Thursday evening by outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan. Lamb will serve out the remaining eight months of former Republican Rep. Tim Murphy\u2019s term. Lamb was the first, and so far only, Democrat to flip a House seat out of the seven special elections held during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. There are two more special elections scheduled between now and November. \u201cWe are all in this together, we need solidarity with each other,\u201d Lamb said during his first remarks on the House floor, in a call for more bipartisanship. Lamb\u2019s March 13 victory helped boost Democratic enthusiasm and optimism heading into the stretch through November. Democrats now need a net gain of 23 seats in the fall midterms to take back the House. The places that will decide the 2018 midterm elections During last month\u2019s election, Lamb beat Republican state Sen. Rick Saccone by just 755 votes \u2013 a major upset in a district Trump won by 20 points in 2016. RELATED: 7 takeaways from Conor Lamb\u2019s huge but very close night in Pennsylvania The district was previously considered so safe for Republicans that Democrats did not even have a candidate against Murphy on the ballot in 2014 and 2016. The seat opened after Murphy resigned from the House last October. The resignation followed reports that Murphy \u2013 who compiled a staunchly anti-abortion rights voting record in Congress \u2013 tried to privately convince a woman he had an extramarital affair with to have an abortion, according to messages obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The special election drew national attention and major investments from top outside groups involved in the race for control of the House. Republican outside groups spent more than $10 million in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue Saccone, who many operatives believe ran a lackluster campaign. Democratic outside groups spent about $2.5 million on the race. During the months and weeks leading up to the election, top surrogates on both sides of aisle flocked to campaign in the Pittsburgh-area district to stump for their candidate, including Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and former Vice President Joe Biden. It\u2019s not over yet for Saccone. Despite the intensity and expense to both sides, the district will disappear in January. The state Supreme Court redrew Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional map after a long-fought gerrymandering case earlier this year. Lamb is now running in an incumbent-vs-incumbent race against GOP Rep. Keith Rothfus in the new, more-Democratic friendly 17th district, while Saccone is running in the new, more Republican-friendly 14th district. So, less than one year after his bruising defeat, Saccone could still end up in Congress alongside his former opponent.",

In a conversation with David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d a podcast from The University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN, EMILY\u2019s List President Stephanie Schriock says there is an \u201cavalanche\u201d of women running for office, it\u2019s nothing like she\u2019s ever seen before. \u201cAvalanches are dangerous but what\u2019s so powerful about an avalanche is it gets bigger as it goes down. That is what\u2019s happening. It is getting bigger as we keep moving away, it\u2019s growing and growing every day,\u201d Schriock tells Axelrod. Candidate filing deadlines have passed in only half the states and more women are expected to enter the midterm races. The surge in female candidates comes as Democrats try to reclaim the House and Senate from Republicans in November. \u201cI said to Leader Pelosi, \u2018I would like Emily\u2019s List to help deliver the majority. We\u2019d like to elect 23 women and pick up seats to give you the majority,\u201d Schriock says. Today, women make up less than 20% of Congress. Out of 535 total members, there are just 22 women senators and 83 women representatives. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why there isn\u2019t a woman in every race in the country period,\u201d Schriock tells Axelrod, \u201cThere are, for the most part, men in every race, so there should be women.\u201d The majority of women running are Democrats, and it is in part driven by backlash to President Donald Trump and GOP policies in the Republican-controlled Congress. Democratic enthusiasm has spiked throughout the country as election victories, poll numbers and fundraising continue to point to a very engaged Democratic electorate. \u201cAs I travel around the country and we see, particularly for EMILY\u2019s List, this wave of women who are coming into the political process. For us, it\u2019s women saying they want to run for office. But on the ground, it\u2019s women marching and organizing and pulling their communities together,\u201d she says. EMILY\u2019s List released numbers showing that 34,000 women interested in running for office have reached out to the organization since Election Day 2016, and they have trained more than 2,400 women in-person in 2017. Schriock says these are women who are interested in changing the political landscape forever. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to save our democracy,\u201d Schriock says, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about this moment because this isn\u2019t just about 2018. This is going to be the next decades of leadership in this country.\u201d Listen to Axelrod\u2019s interview with Schriock in the player above and check back for a new Axe Files every week.",

            "article_content": "Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards accused Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner of making an offer that felt like a \u201cbribe\u201d during a meeting back in January 2017. Richards, who is planning on stepping down as president in 2018, reveals in her new book that the President\u2019s daughter and son-in-law offered her an increase in federal funding for Planned Parenthood in exchange for its agreement to stop providing abortion services, according to People magazine. \u201cJared and Ivanka were there for one reason: to deliver a political win,\u201d Richards writes in \u201cMake Trouble: Standing Up, Speaking Out, and Finding the Courage to Lead,\u201d which was released Tuesday, People reported. \u201cIn their eyes, if they could stop Planned Parenthood from providing abortions, it would confirm their reputation as savvy dealmakers. It was surreal, essentially being asked to barter away women\u2019s rights for more money.\u201d First on CNN: Planned Parenthood to target 8 states, spend $20 million as part of midterm battle plan According to People, Richards recalled, \u201cThe main issue, (Kushner) explained, was abortion. If Planned Parenthood wanted to keep our federal funding, we would have to stop providing abortions.\u201d A message left with the White House by CNN Wednesday was not immediately returned. In April 2017, when the meeting was first reported, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood told CNN the sit-down was \u201ccordial and informative.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of the meeting, from Planned Parenthood\u2019s perspective, was to make sure that Ivanka Trump fully understood the important role Planned Parenthood plays in providing health care to millions of people and why it would be a disastrous idea to block people from accessing care at Planned Parenthood,\u201d the spokeswoman said at the time. Richards writes in her book that after her meeting with Trump and Kushner, she told the organization\u2019s executive vice president Dawn Laguens that the deal \u201cfelt almost like a bribe,\u201d People reported. The Planned Parenthood leader, who was a Hillary Clinton supporter in the 2016 election, wrote that she met with Trump and Kushner because \u201ceven if there was only a sliver of a chance of changing anyone\u2019s mind, I owed it to Planned Parenthood patients to at least take the meeting,\u201d according to People. Richards told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett in an interview Tuesday that she thinks Ivanka Trump isn\u2019t being a champion for women in her role as senior adviser to her father, the President. \u201cIf her job is to advocate for women, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s done a very good job,\u201d Richards said. \u201cAnd particularly when it comes to women\u2019s rights, we need a strong advocate in this White House.\u201d The bulk of federal money Planned Parenthood receives goes toward preventive health care, birth control, pregnancy tests and other women\u2019s health services. Federal law prohibits taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. But President Donald Trump signed a bill in April 2017 that allowed states to withhold federal money from organizations that provide abortion services, including Planned Parenthood, which has been frequently targeted by Republicans. Planned Parenthood claims to be the largest provider of reproductive health services in the United States, offering sexual and reproductive health care, education and outreach to nearly 5 million women, men and adolescents annually worldwide. Planned Parenthood says abortions make up 3% of its provided services. CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Last year, Justice Anthony Kennedy traveled to the White House, robes and all, and found himself in a familiar spot: the center of attention. Supreme Court prepares for right turn The assembled audience was there for the swearing in of Justice Neil Gorsuch, but many eyes were trained on Kennedy, who like no other justice in recent history controls the outcome of the highest profile cases before the court. Kennedy\u2019s role that day was to deliver the oath to his former clerk, but some of the judicial conservatives assembled in the Rose Garden were wondering if Kennedy might soon provide them with the opportunity to return to their vetting binders. Would he retire and give President Donald Trump a second vacancy and the chance to cement a conservative majority on the court for decades to come? RELATED: Supreme Court prepares for right turn A few weeks later, even the President got pulled in to the guessing game: \u201cI\u2019ve heard the same rumors that a lot of people have heard,\u201d he said from the oval office, according to the Washington Times. In the end, Kennedy made no announcement. After almost 30 years on the highest court in the land, he determined he wasn\u2019t quite finished. Now, as retirement speculation ramps up again, court watchers wonder what went into his calculation for staying on the bench last term \u2013 and if anything\u2019s changed since then. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Significant cases facing the court could have served as the siren call, or maybe Kennedy felt the weight \u2013 and pull \u2013 that one of his colleagues called the \u201cawesome responsibility\u201d of holding the critical vote for the biggest cases. It\u2019s conceivable he was spooked by the volatile first few months of the Trump administration, or perhaps retirement is easier to contemplate than to execute. Whatever motivated Kennedy to stay, conservatives waiting for a chance to push the court to the right were disappointed. And liberals, even though they have been on the losing end of Kennedy votes on issues such as campaign finance and the Second Amendment, now cling to him. He has, after all, given them victories in LGBT rights, abortion access, affirmative action and his replacement under the Trump administration would surely be much younger and more conservative. There is no underestimating his impact. Kennedy was in the majority for 97% of all cases during the 2016-17 Supreme Court term, according to statistics compiled by Scotusblog. In cases where judges were divided, Kennedy was in the majority 93% of the time, by far the highest percentage of the nine justices. The speculation about Kennedy\u2019s future comes as the justices are considering an unusual number of extraordinarily consequential cases where his vote and input will be critical. For example, partisan gerrymandering is front and center. The Supreme Court has never been able to articulate a test concerning the overreliance on politics in map drawing. Back in 2004, the court rejected a challenge to a political gerrymander in Pennsylvania. While four justices believed that courts should never hear such cases, Kennedy held the door open in a separate opinion. Supreme Court not finding consensus on gerrymandering Kennedy acknowledged that ordering a correction of all election district lines for partisan reasons might amount to an \u201cunprecedented intervention in the American political process,\u201d but he would not foreclose the possibility of judicial relief down road. He said that in the future a \u201climited and precise rationale\u201d might emerge. That day may or may not have come this term as the court is hearing not one, but two cases concerning the issue. At oral arguments during one of the cases concerning Wisconsin last October, Kennedy did seem open at one point to the possibility that a standard grounded in the First Amendment could be found. In late March, the court heard a second challenge regarding a map in Maryland. It was clear during oral arguments that the justices were still struggling with the issue. At one point Justice Stephen Breyer even suggested that the court take the two cases and another one pending out of North Carolina and hold rearguments next term. \u201cSome of us saw this as a plea to get Justice Kennedy to stay on the court to see this to the end,\u201d Rick Hasen a professor at University of California-Irvine, opined. A workable framework could be a landmark opinion that could revolutionize how states draw their lines. \u201cIf Justice Kennedy agrees with plaintiffs in either of these cases, then he\u2019ll be known for decades as the justice who succeeded in rooting out the worst abuses in partisan gerrymandering,\u201d said Josh Douglas, a professor University of Kentucky College of Law. \u201cMaking his mark on this issue could be one of the reasons he hasn\u2019t retired yet.\u201d Kennedy will forever be remembered for penning Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 opinion that cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide. This term, the justices are considering Masterpiece Cakeshop v. the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, a case that some believe is a follow up to Obergefell. In Obergefell, Kennedy wrote that opponents to same-sex marriage reached their conclusions based on \u201cdecent and honorable religious\u201d beliefs. Thomas, conservatives impatient at Supreme Court's inaction on 2nd Amendment In Masterpiece, however, Colorado cake baker Jack Phillips, who believes marriage should be between a man and a woman, refused to make a cake for customers seeking to celebrate their same-sex marriage. Now Kennedy might have to reconcile two strands of his jurisprudence: the dignity of same-sex couples and the respect for religious liberty. At oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts referred back to Kennedy\u2019s words in Obergefell and noted that the majority had \u201cgone out of its way to talk about the decent and honorable people who may have opposing views.\u201d Kennedy did seem, at one point, to be receptive to the religious liberty concerns of the baker. Kennedy pointed out that a commissioner on the Colorado Civil Rights Commissioned had expressed hostility toward Phlipps\u2019s beliefs. \u201cIt seems to me that the state in its position here has been neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips\u2019s religious beliefs,\u201d Kennedy said. Journalist Charlie Rose asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2017 about Kennedy\u2019s role as the deciding vote in so many hot button cases. It\u2019s an \u201cawesome responsibility\u201d she said. At another event held in California in 2017, one questioner took a different tack when asking the question. \u201cWho do you want to eat more kale in Washington?\u201d the questioner asked. \u201cJustice Kennedy,\u201d Ginsburg said to laughter. Ginsburg and other liberals are well aware of the President\u2019s promise to reshape the courts. One question is whether Kennedy would feel comfortable retiring during the Trump administration. Heads spun just after the inauguration in February, when Ivanka Trump appeared at the court and sat in the section reserved for VIPs to hear oral arguments. According to the court\u2019s spokeswoman, the President\u2019s daughter was there as the invited guest of Kennedy, who she met at the inaugural lunch at the Capitol. It wasn\u2019t lost on court watchers that Trump chose a former Kennedy clerk as his first pick. Other former Kennedy clerks such as Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Judge Raymond Kethledge of the 6th Circuit are high on a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Like every other Justice, Kennedy cares about the institution of the court and he will take that into consideration whenever he chooses to step down. As a rule, justices don\u2019t like to retire in an election year, always trying to keep the court at an arm\u2019s length from the political process. When Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly died in 2016 the court was forced to work with only eight members for more than a year as the political branches went to war over Scalia\u2019s replacement. The eight-member court is not ideal because if the justices split 4-4, they are simply left to affirm the lower court opinion creating no new precedent. And all eyes will be on November, with the potential for Democrats to take over the Senate. In January, conservative court watcher Ed Whelan wrote for the National Review that \u201cif the rumors are true that Justice Kennedy has been looking to retire, then it seems a reasonable bet that he would do so this spring,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, the very real prospect that Democrats will win control of the Senate in the November 2018 elections might clinch his decision to do so. If he waits until next year, and if Democrats take control of the Senate, his seat would probably remain empty until 2021,\u201d Whelan speculated. Between now and June, Kennedy has almost a full docket of cases to consider. It\u2019s a real possibility that he hasn\u2019t even made up his mind. He\u2019s hired clerks for next term, but warned at least one, two sources say, that retirement is always a possibility. There is precedent for the clerks who are hired by one justice to be absorbed by another justice if a retirement occurs. Indeed, Gorsuch was hired by Jusstice Byron White but served out his clerkship with Kennedy after White retired in 1993. Court watchers, even some in the White House at the time, thought that Justice John Paul Stevens would retire long before he finally did so in 2010. And some may say that Kennedy, is still a youngster at 81. After all, Ginsburg just turned 85.",

            "article_content": "As the White House and Congress descend deeper into turmoil, the US Supreme Court is showing signs of becoming as politically fractured as the rest of Washington. It may likewise be shifting more to the right. Retired Justice Stevens argues for repeal of Second Amendment Indications from the few decisions issued so far and from oral arguments in yet-to-be decided cases suggest the five conservatives on the nine-member bench may be ready to wield their majority power. Led by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by President Donald Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch, the five have already prevailed in recent ideologically charged cases regarding prisoners\u2019 civil rights and immigrants in custody. Historic delays in issuing decisions and at-times sharp jabs between justices on the bench also point to disharmony at a time when the Supreme Court could play a larger role in American life. The Trump administration faces numerous lawsuits over its policies, including new challenges based on the administration\u2019s announcement that the Census will include a question about individual\u2019s citizenship. A looming question since January 2017 has been whether the justices would become a check on Trump, who has flouted legal norms, criticized federal judges, and revealed disdain for the rule of law. In the Supreme Court dispute over immigrants denied bail, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer took the unusual step late last month of reading a lengthy and impassioned dissenting statement from the bench, warning of a new breach of constitutional due process. Such dramatic oral dissents typically occur later in the session, when tensions rise as the court faces a late June deadline and highly anticipated cases with national implications. Linda Brown, woman at center of Brown v. Board case, dies Since the 2017-18 term opened last October, the justices have issued only 17 signed decisions. That is the lowest number through the end of March for any session since Roberts took office in 2005, according to Adam Feldman, whose Empirical SCOTUS blog examines trends at the Supreme Court of the United States. The all-time high for Roberts\u2019 tenure was 32 decisions during this period, the previous low was 19. It is plain more cases are being hard-fought behind the scenes. During public arguments, the nine have appeared sharply divided in disputes over politically gerrymandered voting districts; a baker who declined to make a wedding cake for a gay couple based on his religious beliefs; and public-sector employees who do not want to pay union fees. Beyond those cases already subject to oral arguments, the justices have been wrangling for three months over how to respond to the Trump administration\u2019s request to dissolve a lower court decision that cleared the way for pregnant Central American teenager who entered the US illegally to obtain an abortion. Administration lawyers asked the justices to discipline the girl\u2019s ACLU lawyers for helping her to secure the abortion before Trump administration attorneys appealed the lower court decision. Such is the discord already simmering as the justices prepare to hear another dispute over politically gerrymandered voting districts \u2013 from Maryland, on Wednesday \u2013 and over Trump\u2019s travel ban on certain majority-Muslim countries, in April. The justices have yet to resolve a separate political gerrymandering case, from Wisconsin, heard on October 3. To be sure, the justices could iron out their differences and begin setting a new pattern of consensus. But the signals so far do not suggest themes of harmony. Ramping up the suspense is the possible retirement of moderate conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy. Now 81, Kennedy in 2016 began talking privately about retiring as the presidential election campaign was underway. He has stayed through another full term and may be content to continue as the decisive swing vote as long as his health holds out. The next eldest justices, Breyer, 79, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, are liberals who have shown no interest in slowing down or stepping down. Unlike in past eras when individual justices were not so predictable based on party, the current five appointed by Republican presidents generally vote along conservative lines, and the four named by Democratic presidents vote on the liberal side. The incendiary atmosphere of the Obama and Trump eras and the increasingly polarized judicial confirmation process may be creating a more polarized Supreme Court. \u201cThere are no more stealth justices, no more surprises,\u201d said Harvard University law professor Richard Fallon. \u201cThat means the person (a president chooses) is going to have a strong disposition to line up on one side or another\u201d accelerating conflict on the court. So far, Gorsuch has proved a strong vote for the right. On the left, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, President Barack Obama\u2019s first nominee, has been consistently liberal. Yet, in some years, individual justices from both sides of the ideological divide have sought middle ground, including Roberts, a 2005 appointee of Republican George W. Bush; Kennedy, a 1988 justice chosen by Republican Ronald Reagan; Breyer, a 1994 appointee of Democrat Bill Clinton; and Justice Elena Kagan, Obama\u2019s 2010 choice. Those four justices tried to work toward greater consensus after conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016 and the court went more than a year without a successor because of Senate politicking. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, blocked all action on Obama nominee Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy The Scalia seat was filled in April 2017, and the Supreme Court returned to a full contingent of nine when the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Gorsuch. In late February, Gorsuch wrote the court\u2019s 5-4 ideologically tinged opinion in the case of an Illinois prisoner whose eye socket was crushed and vision permanently impaired by two prison guards. At issue was the percentage that the inmate was required to pay in attorneys\u2019 fees after he won his civil rights lawsuit. The Gorsuch majority interpreted the relevant statute to require 25% of his $307,700 judgment toward the attorneys\u2019 fees. Dissenting liberals said the trial judge who heard the case of the guards\u2019 brutality had the discretion to determine that the prisoner pay 10%. Gorsuch has aligned more to the right than Scalia, showing a strong collaboration with Justice Clarence Thomas. Yet, overall, Gorsuch appears to be seeking to demonstrate his independence. In a case testing whether the Constitution requires a warrant before police may obtain cell phone data from companies that provide cell service, Gorsuch took a counterintuitive approach. Gorsuch focused on the property rights of the cellphone user to the stored data, rather than the privacy expectations that concerned most of the justices. #MeToo will have staying power, Ruth Bader Ginsburg insists This is Gorsuch\u2019s first full term, and relations among justices are still shifting. It is a truism at the nation\u2019s highest court that the change of a single justice alters the relationship among all nine. New patterns emerge on the law and in social relations. Addressing the latter, Ginsburg said earlier this year, \u201cI respect all of my colleagues \u2013 and genuinely like most of them.\u201d",

Arthur Jones\u2019 campaign website includes a section titled \u201cHolocaust?\u201d and he has been involved with anti-Semitic and racist groups since the 1970s, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The Illinois Republican Party denounced Jones\u2019 campaign earlier this year, saying there is \u201cno place for Nazis like Arthur Jones\u201d in the GOP or the country. \u201cThe Illinois Republican Party and our country have no place for Nazis like Arthur Jones. We strongly oppose his racist views and his candidacy for any public office, including the 3rd Congressional District,\u201d Illinois Republican Party Chairman Tim Schneider said previously in a statement. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is leading the party\u2019s effort to keep the House in November, will not endorse Jones, NRCC spokesman Matt Gorman said. Jones will face off against the Democratic nominee in the 2018 midterm election to represent the solid blue district, where Rep. Dan Lipinski has held the seat for more than a decade. The 3rd District represents parts of Chicago and nearby suburbs, including La Grange and Western Springs. Lipinski, a blue-dog, anti-abortion Democrat, is up against Marie Newman, a political newcomer who had the support of several progressive groups and liberal lawmakers, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Another race that attracted national attention for all the wrong reasons was in Illinois 5th Congressional district, where the so-called \u201ccannabis candidate,\u201d Benjamin Thomas Wolf, lost his primary bid against incumbent US Rep. Mike Quigley. In a campaign ad, Wolf smoked marijuana in front of an image of the American flag. That ad ran on Pornhub, among other places, making him the first US politician to advertise on a porn site. Questions have been raised in several outlets, including the Chicago Tribune, about the truthfulness of his biography \u2013 he called himself an \u201cIraq veteran\u201d for the work he did in Iraq for the State Department \u2013 and Politico reported earlier this month on abuse allegations made against him. A former girlfriend, who also interned for his campaign, accused Wolf of physically abusing her during their relationship in a Title IX complaint filed last year. Wolf denied the allegations to CNN and was at one point granted a \u201cstalking no contact\u201d order against her in a Chicago county court. Wolf also told CNN he never misrepresented his credentials. CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi, Maegan Vazquez and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

Dan Lipinski after his hard-fought primary victory in Illinois on Tuesday and hammered his Republican opponent, a Holocaust denier who has been disavowed by both the state and national GOP but nevertheless also won his primary contest. Lipinski \u201cis the Democratic nominee, and he will have the support of the Democratic caucus,\u201d Rep. Joe Crowley, the Democratic caucus chair, said Wednesday at a news conference. Rep. Linda Sanchez, with Crowley at the news conference, added, \u201cIf you know anything about his Republican opponent for the general election you know that Democrats will be united behind Dan Lipinski. Somebody who has identified with extreme, far right, Nazi propaganda is not somebody that we want serving in the United States House of Representatives.\u201d Lipinski survived a progressive primary challenge from Marie Newman on Tuesday for his Chicago-area House seat. His close win (51% to 49%) came despite an intense effort by pro-abortion rights and women\u2019s groups \u2013 including Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America and EMILY\u2019s List \u2013 to purge the party of the anti-abortion lawmaker in a reliably Democratic district. He will face Arthur Jones, the Holocaust denier, in the general election. Crowley also discussed divisions between the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic Party with the midterm elections approaching. He was asked about the message sent by Lipinski\u2019s victory, as well as Conor Lamb\u2019s win in the Pennsylvania special election last week. \u201cI think the message we got from, certainly, the Lamb election is: all politics is local, as Tip O\u2019Neill said,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cWhat Conor Lamb proved is that keeping the issues local \u2013 talking about Social Security and Medicare, and the threat that they\u2019re under by this Republican administration and Republican Congress \u2013 that talking about issues that are local to their communities themselves, and the passion that he brought in representing them, I think, speaks volumes to not just these two elections but for other elections as well.\u201d Crowley continued, \u201cFor all of us, I\u2019ve been counseling people who are running: remember to keep it local. People really identify with their local legislator. And I think that is what certainly Conor Lamb, and I have to suggest that maybe that\u2019s what happened in Illinois 3 as well. But the people have decided and we are moving forward. And we\u2019re a big tent party, and I think that is also represented by those elections as well.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon made national news on Monday with her announcement that she would run in the Democratic primary this year against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But, how much danger does Nixon actually pose to Cuomo, who is seeking a third term as the most powerful elected official in the Empire State? To answer that, I reached out to Capital Tonight\u2019s Nick Reisman. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Was the Cynthia Nixon candidacy expected \u2013 by Gov. Cuomo or the political class more generally? Reisman: I think a lot of people were surprised this became real, including Cuomo. When Albany first heard the rumor of a Nixon candidacy, it was largely seen as being through the prism of Cuomo\u2019s problems with education advocates. Nixon has been very close with the Alliance for Quality Education, an organization that has been pushing the state to fulfill the terms of a lawsuit over equitable funding for school districts. Nixon has been to the state Capitol to advocate on this very issue. Cuomo has long been irritated by this group and its push to increase education spending by more than $1 billion annually in the state budget (New York\u2019s education budget is second to health care in the spending plan ever year). When my colleague Zack Fink at NY1 first broke that Nixon was poised to enter the race, there was some scoffing that this was [New York City] Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s way of messing with Cuomo. After all, there had been word Cuomo was trying to recruit challengers to de Blasio during his 2017 re-election, either Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. or Rep. Hakeem Jeffries. Neither ran. Cuomo clearly saw this as a de Blasio-backed effort. The day after it was reported de Blasio-linked campaign consultants Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz were working with Nixon on a potential primary, Cuomo went on a tear against the mayor. It was very Cuomoian, blasting de Blasio for being all talk and no action in TV and radio interviews that were ostensibly being held about a snowstorm. Cuomo has never faced an opponent like this in his career, so an actual strategy may take a while to emerge. Cillizza: How much disaffection is there within the Democratic Party in the state for Cuomo? And why didn\u2019t someone more prominent \u2013 de Blasio? \u2013 run? Reisman: Polling has shown Cuomo to hold steady with self-identified liberals and registered Democrats. He is, after all, the governor who successfully moved the chess pieces around, LBJ-style, to achieve the legalization of same-sex marriage. One thing Cuomo is really good at, especially in his second term, is recalibrating. The 2014 primary he had with Zephyr Teachout was really a catalyst for the last four years in state politics and his agenda. In that primary, liberals were upset that Cuomo warred with public labor unions over pension benefits and teacher evaluations and would not ban hydrofracking. In term two, Cuomo made peace with the state\u2019s major public employees unions and the New York State United Teachers union. He banned fracking soon after his re-election, winning him praise from environmental groups. He won the passage of an increase in the state\u2019s minimum wage, which will phase in to $15 in the New York City area in the coming years. The $15 minimum wage policy was actually on the platform of the Green Party candidate, Howie Hawkins, in 2014. The $15 minimum wage went from the Green Party to state law in two years. But the biggest concern Democrats and liberals have with Cuomo is the state Senate, which is tied up in a major Gordian Knot. The Senate is narrowly controlled by Republicans (and it\u2019s really the last lever of power Republicans hold statewide in New York). In 2011, on the day Cuomo first took office as governor, four Senate Democrats announced they were forming their own conference, known as the Independent Democratic Conference, led by Bronx Sen. Jeff Klein. The IDC has acted as something of a coalition-style government with Senate Republicans and has grown to eight members. In the 2013-14 session, the IDC actually joined in what was known as a \u201cmajority coalition\u201d with Republicans, sharing power in the chamber. The Republicans regained an outright majority in the Senate in 2014. Cuomo has been seen by his liberals critics as an enabler of this arrangement: a weak Republican conference with a small advantage that he can play off the Democratic-dominated state Assembly. The IDC has gone to pains to take credit for key victories such as several increases in the minimum wage, including the $15 deal. But liberals remain dissatisfied with this arrangement, arguing that a Republican Senate has blocked reforms such as enacting early voting and strengthening abortion rights, both of which Cuomo has endorsed. Cuomo has come under increasing pressure since Donald Trump\u2019s election to help his party gain power in the Senate. Next month is going to be really important. Last year, the New York Democratic Committee announced a unity deal between the IDC and the mainline Democrats, which was dependent upon the party winning two open seats in the Bronx and Westchester County, the latter of which the GOP hopes to be competitive in. Should both Democrats win, the theory is the party has a numerical majority. Here\u2019s where it gets even more complicated: The Democratic world in New York will then have to convince Sen. Simcha Felder to switch conferences. Felder is a registered Democrat who sits with the Republicans in the Senate. He has also been a major thorn in the side of de Blasio. For what it is worth, Felder has said, vaguely, he will join with whichever side is \u201cbest for my constituents.\u201d So, the math would go like this: Democrats win both seats on April 24. There would then be 32 registered Democrats to be seated in the 63-member Senate (eight IDC members, 23 mainline Democratic members and one Simcha Felder). Should Cuomo successfully claim credit for flipping the state Senate \u2013 in the middle of the legislative session, mind you \u2013 it could go a long way to helping stave off further liberal angst with his tenure. As for de Blasio not running: Keep in mind being mayor of New York City is no launchpad to the Executive Mansion in Albany. Ed Koch, famously, could not do it against Mario Cuomo. Upstate Democrats would be skeptical of a de Blasio-for-governor campaign as would, quite frankly, a lot of New York City voters. A prominent person from politics running against Cuomo would face instant blow back from the institutions that are supporting the governor\u2019s re-election. Nixon is a relative outsider and, as we\u2019ve seen on the national level, sometimes that doesn\u2019t hurt. Cillizza: Break down this race. Is it Cuomo vs. Nixon? Or will there be other credible challengers?  And if it\u2019s one-on-one, what does Nixon\u2019s ceiling look like? Reisman: Currently Cuomo does have two other declared contenders in the primary aside from Nixon: Former state Sen. Terry Gipson and Randy Credico, a comedian and activist. Gipson is a one-term former lawmaker from the Poughkeepsie area who lost his re-election in 2014 and then lost an attempted comeback bid in 2016. Credico is certainly a colorful and passionate character who has played a bit role in the Wikileaks saga and has made runs for office before. Perhaps the best, albeit imperfect, guide here is Zephyr Teachout\u2019s primary campaign in 2014. Teachout had little name recognition but harnessed a lot of the proto anti-Cuomo vibes, such as his awkwardness with the Occupy Wall Street movement and his hesitation to tax the rich, along with the anti-fracking movement and public union agita. Teachout got 34 percent of the vote in the primary. If there\u2019s a baseline for Nixon, it\u2019s that. A Siena College poll that was taken last week, before Nixon entered the race, put her at 19 percent against Cuomo. I expect that will climb. A lot of people expect Nixon to draw votes in New York City, given the headaches surrounding mass transit and the subway in particular. Don\u2019t be so sure. Teachout got votes in the primary from rural, upstate voters too, what I call Farmers Market Democrats. Think enclaves like Ithaca. Many of them probably voted for Bernie Sanders, are concerned with the environment and income inequality. There\u2019s not a ton of these people, but if this is close, they could be important. Meanwhile, Cuomo could still draw votes in New York City, especially from black and Latino supporters. That leaves the suburbs: the Hudson Valley and Long Island. If it\u2019s close, expect Cuomo in those areas \u2013 a lot. Also important to note: New York\u2019s primaries are closed to people enrolled in the parties. Cillizza: New York doesn\u2019t have term limits on its governors. But history suggests people get sick of them. Is Cuomo pushing the needle on that or no? Reisman: Great question! We\u2019ll know in November. But seriously, New Yorkers don\u2019t get that sick of their governors, necessarily. George Pataki served three terms. Mario Cuomo served three terms. Nelson Rockefeller left to become vice president after being elected four times. Mario Cuomo was caught up in a combination of incumbency fatigue and the 1994 Republican wave that Al D\u2019Amato saw the chances of a little-known state senator named George Pataki being pretty good. There was fatigue with Pataki after three terms and a strong challenger in Eliot Spitzer in 2006 that hastened his retirement. The fact remains that for governors of New York, as well as mayors of the city, the third term is always a tough one. Ask Michael Bloomberg, Ed Koch or Mario Cuomo. We haven\u2019t really gotten into the campaign season just yet with Cuomo, so we don\u2019t what his theory of the case is for why he wants to serve another four years. I think he does genuinely love being governor of New York, though. He likes that his father held that job and the prestige he sees with occupying the office. The big \u201cwhat if\u201d remains political corruption and whether there will be any fallout from the trial of Cuomo\u2019s former close aide, Joe Percoco, who was convicted last week. There are more corruption trials to come this year, including one with developers who received major economic developments from the state in an effort to revive the Buffalo economy and just happened to donate to Cuomo\u2019s campaigns. At the same time, the former legislative leaders in the Senate and Assembly, Dean Skelos and Shelly Silver, are being re-tried on corruption charges later this spring. If Cuomo becomes too closely associated with Albany\u2019s sleaze, which he ran against in 2010, then that could present a real problem. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cAndrew Cuomo is ___________ worried about Cynthia Nixon.\u201d Now, explain. Reisman: I would say \u201ccautiously\u201d worried. The flurry of activity we\u2019ve seen from Cuomo in the lead up to Nixon\u2019s announcement \u2013 endorsed by Elton John! protesting gun violence with students! \u2013 was not very subtle, but subtlety has never been his forte. When he\u2019s on his game, Cuomo can be a very skilled politician governing a complicated large state with complicated politics. He sees corners and angles other people don\u2019t, can box in his opponents and has a ton of campaign cash on hand. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he hits $45 million or $50 million [raised] in this race. There is generally a presumption that Cuomo is in good shape: He\u2019s got some well-connected and active labor unions on his side, like 1199 SEIU and the Hotel Trades Council. He\u2019s notched liberal victories on the minimum wage and hydrofracking and he\u2019s been increasingly blistering when it comes to Trump. But! He\u2019s walking a tightrope. Cuomo has a tendency to gaffe, especially when, to borrow a line from \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d, he goes monologuing. Republicans blasted Cuomo once when, in a radio interview, he said \u201cextreme conservatives\u201d have \u201cno place\u201d in New York. In December, my colleague Karen DeWitt of New York Public Radio asked in a free-wheeling gaggle what Cuomo would do about sexual harassment in state government. Cuomo then went on a lengthy explanation of sexual harassment, which some saw as condescending lecturing (mansplaining or \u201cgovsplaining\u201d). The Capitol press corps in Albany does not actually see him all that often. In recent years, Cuomo has rarely held press conferences in the Capitol. This lack of access to him can be frustrating to reporters, but it also makes sense from a strategy point of view. He prefers calling into radio shows or doing satellite interviews on TV, controlled settings compared to the free-wheeling gaggle or shout-y press conference. It boils down to this: Cuomo has little room for error in these next six months.",

While four congressional districts are ranked on CNN\u2019s Key Races, the one major House race to watch tonight is a Democratic primary that\u2019s turned some of the party\u2019s biggest leaders and outside supporters against each other. Polls are open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. EDT Fight for the soul of the Democratic Party: Lipinski is a conservative Democrat who is against abortion, voted against Obamacare and sponsored the Religious Freedom Act, a bill strongly opposed by the LGBTQ community. He\u2019s been an ally of the unions and has long sat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, an important role for his district, which harbors Midway International Airport. He\u2019s been a staple among \u201cBlue Dog\u201d moderate Democrats, who have found themselves at odds with a party that has swung more to the left. A loss for Lipinski against Newman will say a lot about how the Democratic Party views its more conservative members. An anti-abortion, conservative Democrat fights for survival in Illinois primary Which establishment rules? Sens. Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand joined NARAL, Planned Parenthood, EMILY\u2019s List, the Human Rights Campaign and Illinois Democratic Reps. Schakowsky and Gutierrez in supporting Newman for Congress. Lipinski took in the support of the Illinois AFL-CIO, Illinois AFSCME, dozens of local mayors, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times. The winning candidate will show which side of the party has the most strength right now. Holocaust denier on the ballot: The Republican running for the 3rd Congressional District\u2019s nomination is Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier with a history of anti-Semitic comments. Though many Republicans might not support him, he is running unchallenged in this district Hillary Clinton won with 15 points in 2016. This is considered a safe Democratic district, so it\u2019s unlikely he will win in the general election. Still, come 8pm ET tonight, Jones will be the official GOP nominee. A billionaire, a Kennedy and a state lawmaker face off in Illinois governor's primary Money, money, money: With over $150 million raised so far, the gubernatorial race here could end up as one the most expensive governor races in history. Rauner, a millionaire former businessman, could end up facing billionaire J.B. Pritzker, should he win tonight\u2019s Democratic primary.  A fight between these two would end up costing both a lot of their own personal money. The current record is the $280 million spent in California\u2019s 2010 race between Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican Meg Whitman, a record this race could easily surpass.

            "article_content": "The strength of the challenge that Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski is facing from progressive candidate Marie Newman in Tuesday\u2019s Illinois primary is the latest sign that Democratic voters have moved to the left on many issues, including abortion. Lipinski is a conservative, anti-abortion House member. Left-leaning outside groups and some prominent liberals, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democrats, have endorsed Newman in the primary. Lipinski has always represented a district that has been Democratic leaning. When he was first elected in 2004, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry carried the district by 18 percentage points. This past presidential election, Hillary Clinton won it by a nearly identical 15 percentage points. What has changed, though, is Democratic voters in general. An anti-abortion, conservative Democrat fights for survival in Illinois primary Lipinski has voted with President Donald Trump 35% of the time, which is more than you\u2019d expect for a member of Congress representing a district as Democratic leaning as Lipinski\u2019s. The only three House Democrats who have voted with the President more and represented more Democratic leaning districts on the presidential level, Jim Costa of California, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have also been elected with less than 57% of the vote at least once. Lipinski has never won with less than 65% of the vote even in bad Democratic years, on the other hand. Back in 2004, a Democrat from a safe district voting with the president as often as Lipinski might have been tolerated. Gallup found that moderate and conservative Democrats made up more than 60% of all Democrats in 2004. Liberals made up less than 35%. Today, it\u2019s an entirely different ball game. Liberal Democrats, at 50%, are a greater force than the combined 48% of moderate and conservative Democrats. We can see the change in the Democratic electorate on the specific issue of abortion, as well. According to a Quinnipiac University survey in December 2004, 67% of self-identified Democrats said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Still, a significant minority, 27%, said it should be illegal most or all of the time. Today, there are far more pro-abortion-rights voters in the Democratic electorate. In a Quinnipiac poll taken in December 2017, 82% of Democrats said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a 15 percentage point increase from 2004. Meanwhile, only 14% said it should always or mostly be illegal, a drop of nearly half from 2004. Illinois Democratic congressman being challenged on left by political newcomer Further, the importance of the abortion issue has gone up among pro-abortion-rights Americans. A Gallup survey taken in 2004 found that just 10% of those who identified as \u201cpro-choice\u201d said they could vote only for a candidate who was \u201cpro-choice.\u201d In a May 2016 poll, 17% of \u201cpro-choice\u201d Americans told Gallup they could vote only for a candidate who agreed with them on abortion \u2013 a 7-point increase from 2004. The big question for Democrats going forward is what will happen in future primaries. Although there aren\u2019t many members of Congress with Lipinski\u2019s record left to challenge, it\u2019s unclear how liberal one needs to be to avoid a challenge. That\u2019s especially the case with abortion, where being against abortion rights seems like a nonstarter in the Democratic Party. Even Doug Jones of Alabama and Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, who were running in a deep red state and district, respectively, were for abortion rights.",

The primary battle has pitted fundraising machines on both sides of the Democratic divide in pouring millions of dollars into Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary in Illinois\u2019 3rd Congressional District, which covers parts of Chicago and its suburbs. Incumbent Rep. Dan Lipinski is a co-chair of the Blue Dogs, a group of centrist (and at times right-leaning) Democratic lawmakers who\u2019ve been trying to get the party to embrace more moderate stances as the best strategy to combat President Donald Trump and win back control of the House in November. Lipinski, who has represented the district since 2005, opposes abortion rights, didn\u2019t initially support Obamacare and is no fan of Planned Parenthood. The National Right to Life Committee even gave Lipinski a 75 percent rating \u2013 tied for the highest score given to any current Democrat. But the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party is pushing back hard against the notion that moderating the message is the path to victory this fall. Instead, progressives want Democrats to stake out stronger left-leaning positions of the kind championed by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. And they see the Illinois 3rd as the chance to both advance their argument and replace one of the bluest of Blue Dogs with one of their own \u2013 progressive activist Marie Newman. Indeed, Sanders himself endorsed Newman, as did Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. (Nancy Pelosi of California, the top Democrat in the House, endorsed Lipinski.) My friend @Marie4Congress is running in #IL03 against a Democratic incumbent named Dan Lipinski. He\u2019s anti-choice, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ \u2013 and Marie\u2019s primary is in exactly one week. Lipinski and Newman each raised about $1 million just through their own formal campaign channels, according to Federal Election Commission records. And outside groups more than doubled the amount in play for the race \u2013 as super PACs and other interest groups have flooded the zone. More than $1.4 million in outside spending has come in to help Newman, while more than $1.1 million has been spent to aid Lipinski. Lipinski, with his staunch stance against abortion, in particular, has become the target for seemingly every group in the game that supports abortion rights. Planned Parenthood Action Fund, EMILY\u2019s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America and other groups have spent into the six figures combined to oppose Lipinski or support Newman. (Lipinski is more conservative on abortion than Lamb, the triumphant moderate Democrat in Pennsylvania, who has said that while he personally opposes abortion, he supports keeping it legal.) Planned Parenthood\u2019s group alone has spent more than $150,000 on everything from polling services to direct mail to advertising in order to help Newman and oppose Lipinski, the FEC data shows. On the flip side, groups like Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion rights, have rallied to Lipinski\u2019s cause. Nearly $120,000 from Susan B. Anthony List has been spent on not just ads and mailers but also money to fly canvassers to the district, put them up at hotels and transport them in vans to various neighborhoods. Our team of 70 canvassers is gathering for a morning briefing before we load up into vans and head out for our 3rd day visiting homes in #IL03 to urge Democrats to get out and vote for #ProLife Dan Lipinski in his primary!! \u2705 \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udc76 pic.twitter.com/JDr00hy8rp The even bigger money, though, has flowed through the super PACs, which can be formed to raise money and support individual candidates, although not in direct coordination with a campaign. Citizens for a Better Illinois, which favors Newman, has spent more than $1.1 million against Lipinski, blanketing the district with television and digital ad buys. That includes more than half a million last week alone on such anti-Lipinski advertising. The super PAC favoring Lipinski, United for Progress, has spent nearly $1 million as well \u2013 on advertising, direct mail and get-out-the-vote efforts. That includes a $125,000 media buy that hit the district over this past weekend.",

Conor Lamb\u2019s performance in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District Tuesday showed that Democrats can win in areas not recently receptive to the party by focusing on issues important to the local communities and by staking out more centrist positions. The committee responsible for supporting the election of House Democrats began an effort to target candidates like Lamb last spring after losing a high profile special election in suburban Atlanta, according to multiple Democratic party strategists who detailed the effort to CNN. The effort ramped up in the fall, when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee invited a group of moderate Democrats that put them in the majority in 2006 to talk through a winning strategy. The committee gave the \u201cBlue Dog mafia,\u201d as some call them, free rein to work with candidates on campaign operations in some of the toughest districts on the expanded Democratic target list. The group, made up of former policy and campaign aides who now work at DC lobbying shops, consulting firms and industry groups, have set up their own satellite political operation to help vet candidates, determine who is viable to beat the Republican nominee in November, and provide support to build volunteer networks, set up digital operations, and make fundraising connections. \u201cIt was the first time since 2006 that we have become a partner in running and winning these races,\u201d said Kristen Hawn, former Communication Director to the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative lawmakers from rural and suburban districts.

Now those members have found new relevance as Democrats seek to compete in more conservative districts across the country. \u201cThe path to the majority goes through the blue dogs. My very progressive colleagues here get that. It\u2019s the first time since I\u2019ve come to Congress where I feel like the caucus has my back,\u201d Rep. Kurt Schrader, elected in 2008, told CNN. The moderate Oregon Democrat heads up recruiting efforts for the Blue Dog Coalition. So far the group has endorsed 14 candidates, including Lamb, and expects to add more in the coming months. While outside progressive groups are pressing Democratic candidates to pledge support for things like single payer health care plans or champion pro-abortion rights positions, Schrader says his group has criteria about economic positions but \u201cno litmus tests.\u201d He advises candidates to take positions in sync with their constituents, something he said Lamb did, which made him harder to pigeon hole as a typical Democrat. Ben McAdams, the current mayor of Salt Lake County, is a Democratic challenger running against Utah GOP Rep. Mia Love and was endorsed by the Blue Dogs. In a phone interview with CNN, he repeatedly framed himself as a bridge builder. \u201cI can move the needle on the issues and people are familiar with my style of putting problem solving ahead of partisanship,\u201d McAdams said. He added that his would-be constituents are pressing for Medicaid expansion in his state, and said if he won he wanted to work with Trump to boost infrastructure spending. Schrader told CNN he has a lot of Trump supporters in his own district and said he\u2019s open to working with the president. He understands why his posture could be considered \u201ctreasonous\u201d by some of his more liberal colleagues and progressive groups he often doesn\u2019t agree with on big issues. But he also says, \u201cfrankly Trump is the gift who keeps on giving for Democrats. As long as he doesn\u2019t wreck the country or get us into nuclear war for God\u2019s sake, we want Democrats to take over this next midterm and he may be our best asset right now.\u201d Rep. Denny Heck, D-Washington state, is a member of the New Democrat Coalition, a growing pro-business group that now has 68 members, and like the Blue Dogs, is playing a central in party recruiting. He told CNN the playbook for these races is \u201clocal, local, local.\u201d \u201cTalk about the issues that matter in your community. Involve people in your community, engage in conversations about issues that affect your community,\u201d Heck said. \u201cThey won\u2019t be the same as my community.\u201d Heck describes the difference between heading up recruiting efforts this cycle for the DCCC compared to 2016 as \u201cnight and day.\u201d He said it took him three cycles to convince Brendan Kelly, a Navy veteran and prosecutor to run for a seat now held by GOP Rep. Mike Bost in Illinois. \u201cThere are an awful lot of people running who never would have considered it in other times,\u201d Heck said. He pointed to a group of female candidates with national security backgrounds who are running in New Jersey, Michigan, and Florida. As to why people took the leap this time, Heck said, \u201cthe same reason probably a lot of people decided, which is they like to see Congress be more functional and get more done on behalf of the people back home in their districts.\u201d Democrats have candidates running against all except 8 sitting House Republicans. There are 101 districts that the party has identified as in play, and out of those, two dozen have been designated as \u201cred to blue\u201d races where the campaign committee provides resources and other campaign support. One Democratic campaign operative familiar with the planning estimates that there will be roughly 50 to 60 races where the party could invest significant resources, a figure double than the committee spent money on in 2016. Republicans argue that the glut of Democrats running for Congress are coming from progressive groups who are the most outspoken critics of Trump. They point to many districts where multiple Democrats competing in primaries and believe that dynamic means general election candidates will be out of step with voters in the same competitive races Democrats believe they can flip to blue. Heck acknowledges that may be the case in some places. \u201cThe energy among Democrats that has resulted in hotly contested multiple candidate primaries will very likely end up costing us a few seats. However, we will gain way more seats as a consequence of that energy than we will lose because of the crowded primaries.\u201d Another Democratic strategist told CNN that the sheer number of candidates is a key reason why centrist Democrats and their networks across Washington are playing a more active role \u2014 the party needs all the resources it can get to manage the field, including recruiting quality candidates. Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, a former Iraq War veteran and another member of the New Democratic Coalition, helped enlist a group of more than two dozen former military members or others with public service backgrounds. Former Vice President Joe Biden has also been tapped in some cases to make calls to help close the deal with potential candidates. \u201cI think that the leadership is listening,\u201d California Democratic Rep Jim Costa, co-chair of the Blue Dog group, told CNN. \u201cWe are cooperating and collaborating in the last year like we never have before. It\u2019s just a fact.\u201d",

            "article_content": "For someone who talks so much about winning, President Donald Trump is racking up quite the losing streak. The electoral earthquake in Pennsylvania set to send Democrat Conor Lamb to the House of Representatives from a district Trump won by 20 points in 2016 is sparking new questions about the President\u2019s personal political potency. That\u2019s because state Rep. Rick Saccone is not the first GOP candidate during Trump\u2019s term to win the President\u2019s blessing and promptly lose. Trump-backed candidates Luther Strange, Roy Moore and Ed Gillespie also tanked in Senate and gubernatorial races in Alabama and Virginia. Those busted endorsements suggest that for all his mystical connection with his base, Trump is not necessarily an asset for GOP candidates in special elections. They may also be a sign that the President will be more of a liability than an asset for Republicans come midterm elections in November. While some Republicans are in denial over the implications of Tuesday\u2019s special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District, others are concluding that relying on the President in reelection races may not be a sure bet. White House tries to distance itself from Pennsylvania special election \u201cYou better be ready and in the end you determine your own fate in these things,\u201d Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, said Wednesday. Other Republicans heaped blame on Saccone, blasting him as a poor candidate, even though he faced a tough political environment contoured by the President\u2019s low approval rating. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to control your own destiny, and he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Rep. John Shimkus, a Illinois Republican. The relative talents of Saccone and Lamb are among many factors \u2013 local, national and demographic \u2013 that help explain Tuesday\u2019s voting, which left the Democrat claiming victory with just a few votes left to be counted. But the unpopularity of the President and the fact that he had traveled to the district Saturday to offer his endorsement, albeit in a typically wild and rambling rally, inevitably mean he\u2019s getting his share of criticism. Saccone campaign gears up for possible recount in Pennsylvania special election Trump may have both hurt and helped Saccone. His historically poor approval rating is clearly pulling down all Republican candidates. The chaos in governance that the President is fomenting and his alpha male brand of leadership may also help explain his plummet among white female voters, who can be crucial in suburban areas. But some Republicans think Saccone may have done even worse had it not been for Trump parachuting in on Saturday, lambasting \u201cLamb the sham\u201d and inspiring some of his loyal voters to cast ballots. \u201cIt was probably a little bit too little too late,\u201d said Shimkus. Two sources close to the White House told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta that the GOP doesn\u2019t see Saccone\u2019s loss as a referendum on Trump, describing their candidate in PA-18 as \u201cweak.\u201d \u201cCandidates either run hard or run scared. It was obvious that Saccone decided to run scared,\u201d one source said. Still, Republicans accepted Lamb\u2019s win as a wake-up call for November, when the GOP\u2019s congressional majorities will be on the line. It might also concern Trump and his political handlers that his twin message of tax cuts and tariffs \u2013 tailored to the former industrial heartland of Pennsylvania \u2013 couldn\u2019t drive Saccone to victory despite his own liabilities. And there is no escaping the fact that other Trump-backed candidates have also lost. Democrat poised to upset GOP in Pennsylvania special election Last year, Trump came up empty when he backed \u201cBig\u201d Sen. Luther Strange over rival Republican Judge Roy Moore in Alabama. Then, when Moore won the primary, the President took heat for backing him against Democrat Doug Jones despite the allegations of sexual assault the judge was facing. Moore still lost. In November, the President endorsed Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie, who belatedly ran a Trump-style scorched earth campaign that was rather out of character. He also lost. Trump supporters could point to caveats in each case. In Alabama, the President defied his own instincts by backing the choice of the GOP hierarchy, Strange, rather than Moore, the most anti-establishment, Trump-like candidate. Then, in his run against Jones, Moore\u2019s personal baggage might have doomed him no matter what Trump said. In Virginia, Gillespie was always running uphill, since Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton in 2016 after it was won twice by President Barack Obama. Lamb rejects suggestion that Pennsylvania special election was about Trump Despite his losing streak, Trump may not be a millstone for all Republicans in November \u2013 at least not in races in rural districts. GOP tacticians, however, will have to carefully target his appearances, as they seek to drive out the Trump base to vote in the knowledge that the polarizing President can also fire up Democratic turnout. \u201cSome Republicans are going to have to run different races than other Republicans, particularly those in suburban districts where Trump is not popular,\u201d said Ford O\u2019Connell, a Republican strategist. \u201cIn some of these other districts, Trump might be a huge asset for you. I don\u2019t think there is a one size fits all. I would look at this as more suburban versus not as suburban.\u201d Republicans can also console themselves with the fact that Democrats may struggle to re-create the Lamb prototype. The new congressman held some relatively conservative positions on guns and abortion, for instance, and ran against the establishment of his own party. He did not face a primary, meaning that he could not be tugged to the left in a way that might have alienated moderate conservatives and Trump-voting converts. Lamb also took pains not to alienate Trump voters. \u201cI know people voted for the President and voted for me. I thank them for hearing me out,\u201d he said Tuesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d Conor Lamb claims victory in PA House race In some ways, Trump\u2019s tarnished record of endorsements mirrors the first-term plight of his predecessor. Coming off his hope-fueled victory in 2008, Obama soon discovered that his appeal was largely limited to his own races. He endorsed Jon Corzine in the New Jersey gubernatorial race in 2009, who then lost to Republican Chris Christie in a state Obama had won. He backed Martha Coakley, who was running for Ted Kennedy\u2019s old Senate seat in Massachusetts, but she lost to Scott Brown \u2013 though, as Republicans did with Saccone, Democrats blasted her as a terrible candidate. Obama also had his own Virginia disappointment, backing Creigh Deeds for governor, who then lost to Republican Bob McDonnell. Obama, a magnetic campaigner and singular political personality, was never able to transfer his aura to other Democrats \u2013 and he took a pummeling in midterm elections that cost his party the House and effectively stunted his legislative agenda. When he was back on the ballot himself, however, his political powers were restored and he won re-election by assembling a coalition similar to the one that had carried him to the White House in 2008. If Trump\u2019s latest reverse previews a rout of Republicans at the polls in November, the President will hope that his own political magnetism and quintessential appeal can help him pull off a similar trick in 2020.

            "article_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan sought to explain Pennsylvania\u2019s special election outcome \u2013 where a Democrat is poised to deliver a stunning upset to the GOP in a district Donald Trump handily won in 2016 \u2013 as a race between \u201ctwo conservatives.\u201d Speaking to reporters at the weekly Republican leadership news conference Wednesday, Ryan defined Democrat Conor Lamb as a \u201cpro-life, pro-gun, anti-Nancy Pelosi conservative\u201d and noted that there wasn\u2019t a Democratic primary that would have pulled Lamb to the left. While the Wisconsin Republican argued Republicans need to focus on their legislative track record in Congress and avoid being outraised, he still said he doubts this will become a trend in Republican-leaning districts because there wasn\u2019t a primary. Lamb ran as a moderate eager to work across party lines. He said he supports abortion rights but personally opposes abortion \u2013 a position that matches Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee. And he called for expanded background checks but opposed other new gun restrictions. But he also campaigned on a pro-union platform. He toed the Democratic line on health care, aired advertisements opposing Ryan-backed reforms to Medicare and Social Security, and hammered the Republican tax bill, arguing it would balloon the deficit and lead to cuts to entitlement programs. Asked by CNN if this should also be \u201ca wakeup call\u201d to the President, Ryan argued that Trump helped make the race as close as it is. \u201cI think the President helped close this race,\u201d he said, a reference to the campaigning Trump did in the district over the previous weekend. \u201cI think you saw the public polling. The public polling wasn\u2019t looking so good and the President came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now, which is within a few hundred votes.\u201d While he took a few questions on the race, Ryan appeared to grow tired of talking about Pennsylvania. As one reporter toward the end started to ask another question about the race, Ryan moved on to a different reporter. That reporter tried to get Ryan to answer the previous reporter\u2019s question. There was some crosstalk and laughter, but ultimately Ryan never answered the question and took questions on an upcoming appropriations fight instead. Republican leaders also touted the tax reform plan and sought to portray how taxpayers would be affected if Democrats took control and passed their own tax plan.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Conor Lamb is poised to deliver a stunning upset to the Republican Party in a Pennsylvania district Donald Trump handily won in 2016. After a long night of drama, Lamb holds a 627-vote lead over Republican Rick Saccone. With 100% of precincts reporting, Lamb received 113,813 votes, or 49.8% of the vote, to Saccone\u2019s 113,186 (49.6%). There are some remaining votes to be counted, however, including provisional and any military or overseas ballots, which may currently still be in the mail but must be received by the counties by March 20. Republicans have not ruled out the possibility of a recount, which isn\u2019t mandatory for the district but could be requested by precinct with petitions from voters in the next few days. Lamb claimed victory in a speech to his supporters Tuesday night. \u201cIt took a little longer than we thought, but we did it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou did it.\u201d Bob Branstetter, a top adviser to Saccone\u2019s campaign, told CNN Wednesday morning that the campaign has not discussed a potential recount. But, he said, they are waiting for all votes to be counted before reaching a decision on conceding. Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the party is not ruling out the possibility of a recount, and a source familiar with the process told CNN Wednesday morning that the GOP is likely to seek legal action over several areas in this race. The party is going to request that all ballots and voting machines are impounded so nothing is tampered with to allow for a likely recount, the source said. They allege reports of \u201cmiscalibrations\u201d of several voting machines in Allegheny County, including frozen touchscreens where voters intending to cast their ballot for Saccone were only presented with Lamb. The party also accuses the Allegheny County election board of not letting Republican officials into the room where absentee ballots were being counted. The party also said that the Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of state website confused voters by noting new district lines set to take effect in November following the state Supreme Court\u2019s order to redraw districts, the source added. Branstetter also said that the campaign received some calls from voters who were confused about whether they could still vote in the 18th District after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Allegheny County spokeswoman Amie Downs disputed the party\u2019s claims, saying the machines don\u2019t show photos and that they received no calls related to \u201cmiscalibrations\u201d during voting hours Tuesday. She also noted that the county\u2019s confirmation screen on voting machines allows voters to change their vote or give them time to call a poll worker to report an issue. She acknowledged that a person lacking authorization to be in the room where absentee ballots were being counted was blocked from entering, but was later allowed back in when the person was approved to be there. And Wanda Murren, a spokesperson for Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of state, said polling places will not change under the new map provided by the state Supreme Court. It\u2019s a bad sign for Republicans that the 18th District race is razor-tight. Trump won there by 20 percentage points in 2016, and GOP groups pumped $10.7 million into a months-long effort to stave off an embarrassing loss there. Lamb\u2019s performance is ominous for the GOP as it heads into November\u2019s midterm elections. Even a narrow Lamb win would signal that the GOP is in danger even in districts considered safe for Republicans, raising Democratic hopes of capturing the House and maybe the Senate in November. A Republican loss could lead to more House members retiring rather than running into headwinds in re-election bids. Democrats, meanwhile, would look to replicate Lamb\u2019s success in working-class districts with similar demographics. With no declared winner, both parties took a stab at spinning the available results. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claimed victory for Lamb in a statement Tuesday night, while the National Republican Congressional Committee said it was \u201cconfident\u201d Saccone would win. Saccone: We're not giving up, going to win it Earlier in the evening, before it became clear the results would be so close, several Republican officials told CNN they were expecting Saccone to lose. Party officials were placing the blame squarely on Saccone\u2019s campaign but also on Trump\u2019s Saturday rally for the candidate, which some Republicans believe helped drive up Democratic turnout. When the race tightened, that outlook improved, with one GOP source telling CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a blowout \u2013 for now, we\u2019ll happily take it.\u201d A Republican official told CNN that Trump, who was raising money with GOP donors in Beverly Hills, California, had been asking for updates throughout the evening and was pleasantly surprised by the narrow margin. Lamb and Saccone were running to replace former GOP Rep. Tim Murphy, who resigned after allegedly urging a woman with whom he was having an affair to have an abortion. The stakes are largely psychological: Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court recently ruled that its congressional districts were gerrymandered and redrew the map \u2013 meaning both candidates would face choices about where to run if they want to be on the ballot in November. CNN\u2019s Adam Levy, Jennifer Agiesta, Jeff Zeleny, Rebecca Berg and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The special election in southwest Pennsylvania came to an end on Tuesday night and, though the winner remains in doubt, the post-election spin is already writing itself. Democrat Conor Lamb holds a slight lead over GOP candidate Rick \u201cI was Trump before Trump was Trump\u201d Saccone, but the margin is slight and has varied throughout the night \u2013 meaning political operatives and pundits are shuffling through talking points pegged to varying results. The mixed messengers have, over the past few weeks, included the most powerful political pontificator in the land \u2013 President Donald Trump. According to Axios, he was, in the days before the polls opened, not-so-privately dumping on Saccone and his campaign, calling the Republican \u201cweak.\u201d Meanwhile, Democrats are still champing at the bit, prepared to declare Lamb\u2019s victory (Lamb and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee got tired of waiting and did it before the official call) \u2013 in a district Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016 \u2013 a canary in the GOP\u2019s congressional coal mines. Here\u2019s what you can expect to hear more of beginning around the time the coffee \u2013 or lunch \u2013 is ready on Wednesday\u2026 Dems\u2019 take: Republicans have dominated this district for 15 years. Former Rep. Tim Murphy, who resigned in October after it was revealed he\u2019d asked his lover to get an abortion, ran his last two races unopposed by a Democrat. And now, this! Saccone\u2019s struggles, especially on the fundraising front, and eventual loss show that Trump\u2019s unpopularity is pulling down his party, while enraging and engaging Democrats. This is the second consecutive high profile race, after the Alabama US Senate clash, in which Trump\u2019s preferred candidate fell short even with the President\u2019s blessing and an overwhelmingly red electorate. GOP take: Saccone was a poor candidate, while Lamb was a very good one. Lamb also had the benefit of being able to tack to the center, basically running as a moderate Republican (\u201cRepublican lite\u201d), because the unique nature of the race cut off any potential challenge from his left. Enjoy it now, Dems \u2013 November will be a lot more complicated. GOP take: \u2026 is not much different than if Saccone loses. At least among party people. From Trump, though, there will be a declaration of total victory. That line from Saccone about being like Trump will probably end up in a presidential tweet. This past Saturday night\u2019s rally will also likely be highlighted as the event that put a laboring Saccone over the top. Also, tariffs. It goes something like this: The white working class sees a President on their side and, despite a whole bunch of spending by Democrats (and groundwork by local unions) to convince them otherwise, they sided with Trump\u2019s guy. Dems\u2019 take: Again, familiar fare. Republicans have dominated this district for 15 years. No Democrat challenged Murphy the last two cycles and Trump (and Mitt Romney and John McCain before him) won it handily \u2013 in the 20-point range \u2013 in presidential years. It took Trump less than two years on the job to turn it into a toss-up. Oh, and about the fundraising. Yes, it\u2019s true Lamb outraised Saccone. But that doesn\u2019t account for outside groups, which rescued Saccone (total bucks dedicated to electing him way outpaced Lamb). Republicans won\u2019t be able to dedicate those kinds of resources to every endangered House seat this fall \u2013 and there are many. The losing side will continue to drift this way as the hours pass on Wednesday. They\u2019ll note that Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional map is about to change, and in a way that favors Democrats. The winner on Tuesday will, if he jumps back in, be running for a different seat come November, perhaps in the state\u2019s newly drawn 14th or 17th districts. A lot can happen between then and now, but by January of 2019, Saccone and Lamb could be in the same queue, both waiting to be sworn in to the 116th US Congress.",

            "article_content": "Voters in southwest Pennsylvania are heading to the polls Tuesday for a special election. Democrats, looking to take back the majority in Congress next year, are hoping a high-profile win in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District will give them a boost in the heart of Trump country. Republicans are hoping to avoid an embarrassing defeat in a district that has voted Republican since 2002. THE \u201cW\u201d WORD: Democrats are eager to call 2018 a wave year in which they\u2019ll take back the majority in the House, and possibly the Senate. It\u2019s too early to make that call now, but if Lamb wins, it will bolster Democrats in districts that seem out of reach both due to their political makeup and fundraising. They can gain some major \u201cMo\u201d(mentum) here tonight that could help bring in a big \u201cW\u201d in November. THE DISTRICT WILL LIKELY DISAPPEAR: If you thought $12 million being spent by outside groups on one special election race that won\u2019t immediately change the power dynamics on Capitol Hill was crazy, consider this: The district will likely disappear in November! The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled the current congressional map unconstitutional and created a new one after the governor and Legislature failed to agree on how to change it. The area has been split up into different districts beginning next year, which illustrates just how seriously both sides are taking this race. WHICH SURROGATE MADE THE BIGGEST IMPACT: Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and former Vice President Joe Biden all campaigned here for the candidates. They will certainly hit the trail for more candidates between now and November, but how and where they campaign next could change after the votes are counted in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th. THE BLAME GAME: If Republicans lose tonight, they will call Saccone a poor candidate who couldn\u2019t fundraise and didn\u2019t define himself early enough. If Democrats lose, they\u2019ll point to the district\u2019s history and call a close race a win for them anyway (though Democrats have flipped 39 state legislative seats since Trump took office, they haven\u2019t been able to do it for a congressional seat). Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that recounts are not automatically triggered in congressional races in Pennsylvania.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are in the final hours of their frantic, all-out bid to save a Pennsylvania congressional district in the heart of Trump country from falling into Democratic hands in Tuesday\u2019s special election. Democrat Conor Lamb, a 33-year-old Marine veteran and former prosecutor, holds a slight lead among likely voters over Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone, a Monmouth University poll released on the eve of the 18th District election shows. RELATED: Track results from the special election for Pennsylvania\u2019s open House seat It\u2019s left the GOP bracing for what would be its most embarrassing \u2013 and ominous \u2013 loss since Donald Trump took office. Republicans have spent more than $10 million to prevent a defeat in the district, which Trump won in 2016 by 20 percentage points. If Lamb wins, or even comes close, it will be a signal that Republicans are in danger even in districts where Trump was won handily in 2016, and raise Democratic hopes of capturing the House and Senate this fall. The race would also serve as a model for Democrats running in deep-red districts across the country. \u201cThe world is watching,\u201d Trump said in an appearance in the district Saturday night, upping the pressure for Saccone to deliver on Tuesday. Trump touts GOP candidate \u2014 and talks drug dealers, 2020 and Oprah in whirlwind rally The race is all about the psychological fallout. Republicans have suffered major losses during Trump\u2019s presidency, including a blowout in the Virginia gubernatorial race and a loss in Alabama\u2019s Senate race. But those races were more easily explained. The GOP already knows the suburban areas where they were walloped in Virginia are at risk, and in Alabama, Roy Moore faced credible accusations of child molestation. A series of 39 red-to-blue flips in state legislative races got less national attention, though they continued to show an enthusiastic Democratic base. And the party had managed to hold on in House races, including one in the Atlanta suburbs last spring. Western Pennsylvania is different. It\u2019s a white, blue-collar region that has overwhelmingly backed Republicans in recent presidential elections.  And, unlike last year\u2019s contests, Republicans now can tout the tax bill that they had hoped would be a persuasive selling point in key races. Particularly worrying for Republicans is that Lamb has managed to parry the attacks they\u2019ve hoped will work across the map. He aired a television ad noting that he opposes House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who is deeply unpopular with conservative voters. Lamb has run to the right of most Democrats on a series of issues. He\u2019s said he personally opposes abortion. His first campaign ad featured him shooting a semiautomatic rifle, and he\u2019s opposed new gun control measures in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, shootings. He\u2019s also supported Trump\u2019s steel tariffs, muting what the President hoped would be a major selling point for Saccone. National Republicans have done everything possible to save the district. Trump visited twice, including a rally Saturday night where he spoke for 75 minutes and whipped supporters up to back Saccone. \u201cThis guy should win easily,\u201d Trump said, pointing to the size of his own victory there. 'The Steel Curtain is gone': Trump's trade moves may be of no help in Pennsylvania special election Vice President Mike Pence, Donald Trump Jr., top White House aide Kellyanne Conway and other senior Republicans visited the district, too. House Republicans poured cash onto the Pittsburgh airways and into get-out-the-vote programs. The National Republican Congressional Committee spent $3.5 million. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan, spent $3.3 million. The Republican National Committee chipped in $1.1 million and ran a massive field program, while the Trump-aligned super PAC America First Action spent $1 million. Democrats, meanwhile, spent relatively little: Patriot Majority PAC spent $450,000 and Vote Vets spent $344,000. Several other groups spent smaller amounts, largely on digital advertising. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $260,000 on television advertising. The lower Democratic spending was in part because the party is gearing up for dozens of races in districts with a recent history of voting more Democratic in presidential races this fall \u2013 and in part because they didn\u2019t need to spend money to back Lamb. He outraised Saccone by a nearly five-to-one margin, hauling in $3 million by the most recent campaign finance reports filed February 21. Fearful of a loss, Republicans are downplaying expectations and trashing Saccone as a candidate. The GOP\u2019s attempt to downplay the race\u2019s importance appears to center on two key factors: Saccone\u2019s weak candidacy, explained through his paltry fundraising, and the district\u2019s Democratic voter registration advantage, even though that edge isn\u2019t reflected in its recent presidential or congressional voting history. Trump has closely followed the race for weeks and received multiple briefings on it last week, a senior White House official said. The official said Trump views Saccone as a weak candidate and is aware that he\u2019s struggled to raise money \u2013 but that Trump went into his rally Saturday hoping to move the needle for Saccone with his base of blue-collar supporters, particularly in the wake of his steel tariff announcement. When Trump stood on stage with Saccone in Moon Township on Saturday, he made clear the pressure for a GOP win Tuesday. \u201cI hate to put this pressure on you, Rick,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re all watching because I won this district, like, by 22 points. It\u2019s a lot. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Look at all those red hats, Rick.\u201d ",

Here\u2019s a look at where the candidates stand on several key issues in the race: Health care: Lamb criticized the GOP attempt to repeal Obamacare and called for bipartisan efforts to stabilize its markets. \u201cI\u2019ll work with anyone from either party who wants to help people with pre-existing conditions, improve the quality of care, and reduce premiums, out-of-pocket costs, and prescription drug prices,\u201d he says on his campaign website. Taxes: He called the GOP tax bill a \u201cgiveaway\u201d to wealthy Americans and said he supports cuts for the middle class. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to add a penny to our debt to have the tax cut for our working and middle-class people,\u201d Lamb said in a debate. Gun control: He\u2019s called for a stronger system of background checks but no new gun restrictions. \u201cI believe we have a pretty good law on the books and it says on paper that there are a lot of people who should never get guns in their hands,\u201d Lamb said. Tariffs: He supports President Donald Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, saying at a debate that \u201cwe have to take some action to level the playing field.\u201d Abortion: Lamb personally opposes abortion but backs the Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing it. \u201cOnce you make something a right, it\u2019s a right. And it\u2019s like that for a reason,\u201d he told HuffPost. Lamb told the Weekly Standard he doesn\u2019t support a ban on abortion at 20 weeks. Health care: He says he wants to repeal Obamacare and his campaign website calls for utilizing \u201cfree-market principles to fix our health care crisis.\u201d Taxes: Backed the GOP tax bill. \u201cIt\u2019s not the \u2018crumbs\u2019 that Nancy Pelosi and her crew on the left say,\u201d Saccone said in a debate. \u201cThese people are very happy to have the bonuses that they received.\u201d Gun control: Saccone has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association and has opposed new gun restrictions. Tariffs: In a statement, his campaign said if tariffs are necessary \u201cto protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania, Rick would support those measures.\u201d Abortion: Saccone opposes abortion rights and touts the endorsement of National Right to Life and other anti-abortion groups.",

            "article_content": "There\u2019s nothing like a Supreme Court vacancy to fire up the GOP base. And that\u2019s exactly what at least one endangered Republican is hoping for before November. \u201cKennedy is going to retire around sometime early summer,\u201d predicted GOP Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, who is rated by CNN as one of the two most vulnerable Republican senators vying for reelection in November. Politico reported that it obtained audio of Heller speaking at an event in Las Vegas last week. Heller continued, \u201cWhich I\u2019m hoping will get our base a little motivated because right now they\u2019re not very motivated. But I think a new Supreme Court justice will get them motivated.\u201d Sources close to Kennedy, who will turn 82 in July, told CNN last summer that he was seriously considering retirement, so a decision by him to step down would not come as a complete shock. It is true that Republicans have a successful track record with Supreme Court nominations. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used his power over the Senate floor to ice Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia after his February 2016 death, for nearly a year. The ultimate nomination and confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to that seat, albeit after changing Senate rules, is the unqualified high mark of Trump\u2019s early months in office. That guaranteed Republicans would have a very specific and important issue on which to vote. There\u2019s no doubt it helped Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. In exit polls, 21% of 2016 voters said the Supreme Court was their most important factor in their vote. Trump won those voters 56% to Clinton\u2019s 41%. If Kennedy retires, Donald Trump's legacy is set More generally, 70% of voters said the Supreme Court was an important issue. Trump won them more narrowly with 49%. Heller is also right that it\u2019s an issue that resonates more with the base of GOP. A CNN/ORC poll in October just before the 2016 election shows that the issue of the Supreme Court is more important to the conservatives that form the base of the GOP. Sixty-four percent of conservative Republicans said the Supreme Court was an \u201cextremely important\u201d issue in determining their vote. Just 41% of moderates, regardless of party, said the same. Fifty-eight percent of Trump supporters in that poll said it was extremely important compared to 46% of Clinton voters. Of course, the issue is important to liberals as well. And since Kennedy is seen as the key swing vote on the issue of abortion, his retirement could just as easily have the consequence of motivating more supporters of abortion rights. However, the map in 2018 favors Republicans. Heller is one of only two Republicans that CNN rates \u201ctossup\u201d compared to six Democrats. And Republicans are defending just eight seats. Democrats are defending 26. Despite that advantage, the national mood seems to favor Democrats as Trump\u2019s approval rating remains historically low. A Kennedy retirement would allow Trump to cement a conservative legacy on the court. Kennedy is often viewed as the current court\u2019s swing justice. His willingness to side with liberal justices has been crucial. A Kennedy retirement would give Trump the chance to replace a relative centrist with a younger, and more conservative nominee, guaranteeing a staunch right-leaning block on the court that could last for decades. Kennedy\u2019s wiliness to side with liberal justices on issues such as affirmative action, abortion access access and same-sex marriage infuriated judicial conservatives and they\u2019d relish the opportunity to replace him. But, as CNN\u2019s Ariane de Vogue has written, Kennedy is likely to be aware that a retirement that close to an election is sure to further politicize his successor. Under normal circumstances, justices don\u2019t like to retire during an election year. That\u2019s why so many people thought that if Kennedy had any notion of retiring he would have done so last year to insulate the court from political firestorms. As things stand now, if he were to step down the hearings of his successor, as Heller pointed out, could well be a political firestorm. And if, there were no hearings this summer, and the Senate flipped it\u2019s even possible there could be an open seat for an extended period as the Senate battled it out.",

            "article_content": "Planned Parenthood\u2019s political arm is targeting eight states with competitive Senate and governor\u2019s races in its largest-ever midterm election campaign. The offensive is set to cost $20 million, an initial mark that the organization\u2019s officials say is all but certain to be exceeded. The investment from Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Votes, the organization\u2019s political entities, makes it one of the biggest outside spending forces in Democratic politics headed into a cycle in which the party sees a rare opportunity to pick off GOP seats across the map. Planned Parenthood president stepping down in 2018 It\u2019s part of Planned Parenthood\u2019s effort to sustain the momentum of the Women\u2019s March the day after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration and turn women\u2019s health care and reproductive rights into issues that drive voters to the ballot box to oppose Trump and GOP candidates. The initial list of targets includes eight states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It comes on top of $4.5 million spent on last year\u2019s governor\u2019s races in Virginia and New Jersey. The groups are set to announce their plans later Thursday. The targeted states are part of a two-for-one approach of prioritizing states with competitive races this fall for both Senate seats that could help Democrats keep Trump in check and governors\u2019 offices that are crucial to the redistricting process after the 2020 Census. Riding the momentum from the #resistance, Planned Parenthood is 'going on the offense' \u201cThis is our last chance to flip some of those governors\u2019 seats before redistricting,\u201d said Deirdre Schifeling, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cA lot of those states have governors who have been terrible for women, terrible for access to reproductive health care.\u201d Arizona and Nevada are particularly important: The states represent Democrats\u2019 two best chances of picking off GOP-held Senate seats this cycle, with Nevada Sen. Dean Heller seen as vulnerable in a state Hillary Clinton won and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake retiring in what\u2019s rapidly becoming a swing state. A handful of House races are likely to join the list of targets, with officials eyeing contests in California, New Jersey, New York and Texas as potential targets. And state legislative races and attorneys general contests are also on a watch list of races that could be added. Planned Parenthood is also spending money in Democratic primaries, including backing Marie Newman in her bid to unseat Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, who opposes abortion rights. Brianna Keilar challenges GOP lawmaker over Delta discount claims Planned Parenthood\u2019s political arms argue that reproductive health has been a driving issue in recent elections, citing the group\u2019s own polling showing that black voters moved toward Ralph Northam in the Virginia governor\u2019s race by 19 points and older voters and moderates also moved in Northam\u2019s favor after hearing reproductive health care and rights messaging. In Nevada, the group argues, Republican former Rep. Joe Heck\u2019s opposition to Planned Parenthood was a deciding factor in Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s win in 2016. The emphasis of the digital program, in a nod to the reshaped electorates in Virginia and Alabama\u2019s Senate special election, is on engaging with infrequent voters, young people and people of color, especially women. It will begin with efforts to engage with those voters on issues they care about and persuade them that their voices matter in the current political moment and later switch to a focus on elections and individual candidates. The organization is also planning large-scale, state-level training programs for activists. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this work in such a way to make sure that we are furthering this activism we\u2019re seeing in this moment into long-term electoral engagement,\u201d Robinson said.",

It might just be the most important race no one is paying attention to right now. On its face, Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District isn\u2019t much of a Democratic target. Donald Trump won the district by 20 points in 2016 and Mitt Romney carried it by 17 in 2012. Republican Rep. Tim Murphy had held it easily since 2002; he was unopposed in 2014 and 2016. But\u00a0Murphy was forced out of Congress in October when reports surfaced that he had urged a woman with whom he was having an affair to get an abortion. That forced this special election. Republicans chose state Rep. Rick Saccone as their nominee, Democrats picked prosecutor and veteran Conor Lamb. From the start, Republican insiders were worried about the candidate contrast: Saccone is a 60-something-year-old state legislator, Lamb is a 30-something Marine. That mismatch in candidate quality wouldn\u2019t have been enough to turn this into a barn-burner. But when coupled with an unpopular Republican president, the political climate might just be turning toxic on Saccone. David Wasserman, the House editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, changed the rating on the Pennsylvania race Tuesday from \u201clean Republican\u201d to \u201ctoss-up,\u201d writing by way of explanation: \u201cFor over a month, private polls on both sides have shown Saccone leading in the low-to-mid single digits, often within the margin of error. Today, the candidates are better known, but Lamb hasn\u2019t let Republicans nationalize the race and Saccone still hasn\u2019t pulled away. The contest is exceedingly close, and Republican operatives are preparing to spin a loss as the result of an unfavorable candidate contrast.\u201d It\u2019s clear Republicans are on the defensive and are prepping for a loss. The Point: Republicans can try to spin a loss in Pennsylvania any way they like. But if Democrats win a district that Trump carried by 20 points, the worry coursing through Republican ranks today will rapidly transform into outright panic. And rightly so.

Shannon Edwards, a clinical forensic psychologist, is running as a Republican in Pennsylvania\u2019s 14th Congressional District race, she announced Wednesday in downtown Pittsburgh, according to the newspaper. Why the new Pennsylvania map is a 'huge' deal in the fight for House control CNN has attempted to reach Edwards for comment. Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican who held a staunchly anti-abortion voting record while he was in Congress, had urged Edwards, with whom he was having an affair, to get an abortion, according to messages obtained and released by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last October. \u201cAnd you have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,\u201d Edwards reportedly wrote to Murphy on January 25, facing a pregnancy scare. Murphy decided to resign shortly thereafter in October, opening up a March 13 special election in the 18th District. During her announcement Wednesday, Edwards said she doesn\u2019t regret her past relationship with Murphy and expects it will be used against her during the campaign, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. \u201cMy opponents are likely to spend egregious amounts of time and money in an attempt to display my human mistakes for all to see,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI was warned. I have been given explanations. I have been told to back down, and I am here to tell you, nevertheless, I will endure.\u201d Although Edwards is running in the 14th District, she could face a different opponent in the May primary due to the state Supreme Court\u2019s map of new redrawn congressional districts. If the redrawn map holds, the current 18th District, with some tweaks, would become the new 14th District, and Edwards could find herself up against Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone, who\u2019s running to fill Murphy\u2019s vacant seat. Edwards\u2019 campaign plans to focus on mental health issues, education and criminal justice reform, the Post-Gazette reported.",

He declined to say whether President Donald Trump had urged him to rethink his decision but suggested he is getting pressure from Republicans in Washington and at home. If he runs, Cramer could reverse one of the GOP\u2019s biggest recruiting misses of the 2018 election cycle. His January decision to forgo a campaign against Heitkamp in what was expected to be one of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable Democratic-held seats left the GOP with state Sen. Tom Campbell. Cramer \u2013 as a statewide elected official in North Dakota, which has only one House seat \u2013 would bring a much higher profile to the race. Democrats noted that a year ago, Republicans appeared to have soured on Cramer as a Senate recruit. Joshua Karp, a spokesman for the Democratic group American Bridge 21st Century, said that \u201canyone who says he\u2019s a top recruit is either lying through their teeth or related to him.\u201d North Dakota\u2019s Republican Sen. John Hoeven wouldn\u2019t say Tuesday whether Cramer will run, but said he\u2019s \u201cbeen asked to reconsider it by a lot of people.\u201d Cramer said he has worked with Heitkamp on a series of issues and likes her personally but has heard from people back home that she doesn\u2019t reflect the values of voters. He singled out her votes against the GOP tax bill and an anti-abortion-rights measure as counter to voters in North Dakota. But he acknowledged that the slim margin of GOP control in the Senate has been the argument he has been hearing from a variety of people in Washington in favor of a possible run. \u201cThe fragility of the Senate majority, the agenda, the second of half of a presidential term and it\u2019s a patriotic call and it\u2019s not without a lot of merit and nobility,\u201d Cramer said. But he said he\u2019s still weighing that against family considerations. Because it\u2019s a state with a small population, a Senate run could mean spending eight months arguing over 25,000 voters, he said. Even after he announced he was going to run again for his House seat, Cramer said he still received encouragement back home to run for the Senate. \u201cYou can be flattered by a president but you can be inspired by a neighbor, and that\u2019s how I feel about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe it to listen to these people one more time.\u201d Cramer said he believed that if he entered the race he would prevail: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt pretty comfortable with that.\u201d But he added, \u201cI\u2019m not foolish to say it\u2019s easy. \u2026 It will be a very hard race.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans are warning that Sen. Bob Corker would be doomed in Tennessee\u2019s primary if, in a change of heart, he decides to run for re-election. In the months since Corker announced he would retire \u2013 and publicly feuded with President Donald Trump \u2013 the GOP establishment and outside forces have coalesced around Rep. Marsha Blackburn as his replacement in a race against Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen. Sen. Bob Corker's second thoughts on retiring The prospect of a Corker re-election run has emerged in part due to concerns that Blackburn can\u2019t win in November, potentially flipping the Senate into Democratic hands. But it\u2019s not clear that Corker would be a stronger candidate than Blackburn in a general election \u2013 and Republicans believe he\u2019d be the heavy underdog in a primary, creating a waste of time, money and damaging the GOP\u2019s overall election hopes. Trump won the state by 26 points, and his favorability with Republican voters is consistently around 90%. Blackburn has cast herself as an unabashed Trump ally \u2013 whereas Corker has publicly feuded with the President who has dubbed him \u201cLiddle Bob Corker.\u201d Despite the odds, Corker, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander have discussed a Corker run. Blackburn will not step aside for Corker, said spokeswoman Andrea Bozek. \u201cAnyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can\u2019t win the general election is just a plain sexist pig,\u201d Bozek said. \u201cShe is the best fundraiser in the country and is beating Phil Bredesen in several polls despite never even running statewide,\u201d she said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about these ego-driven, tired old men. Marsha has spent her whole life fighting against people who told her she isn\u2019t good enough and she\u2019s going to do it again.\u201d While Washington chattered Monday about the prospect of a Corker re-election bid, Blackburn was in New York City courting top donors alongside Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. The trip underscored how fully Blackburn has been embraced by the GOP. The party\u2019s establishment sees her as capable of beating Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen in a state President Donald Trump won by 26 percentage points in 2016. The Koch brothers political operation and conservative group Club for Growth have also quickly aligned behind Blackburn\u2019s campaign. That Corker would face an uphill battle in getting back into the race is also the view of top Republicans \u2013 including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who CNN\u2019s John King reported Sunday told Corker he\u2019d need to first get Trump on board. Corker is torn about what to do, a source familiar with his thinking said. He has enjoyed being a senator and having the influence that he does. But after talking to some of his colleagues, and having smoothed over his relationship with Trump, he\u2019s starting to harbor second thoughts, multiple sources said. He knows he has to make a decision, and knows he would have a tough fight against Blackburn if she continued to run, the sources said. Alexander has spoken to Corker but is not pushing him to run, one source said. Corker, he believes, needs to make the decision soon. Asked Monday by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju whether he is having second thoughts about retirement and is considering running for re-election, Corker three times responded: \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say.\u201d He repeated those words when told his response would be viewed as not ruling it out. The Club for Growth conducted a poll in January that several Republicans pointed to as they analyzed the race. That poll showed Blackburn with a massive 38-point lead over Corker \u2013 drawing 63% from Republican primary voters to Corker\u2019s 25%. It also showed Blackburn outpacing her primary rival, former Rep. Stephen Fincher, by 53 points in a head-to-head matchup. The poll found that Blackburn is viewed favorably by 64% and unfavorably by 12% of Republican primary voters \u2013 much better marks than Corker\u2019s underwater 44% favorable and 50% unfavorable ratings. In an election cycle that has seen a series GOP fundraising disappointments, Blackburn has been an exception. She raised $2 million in the first two months of her campaign and had $4.6 million in the bank at the end of 2017. She\u2019s already reserved $1 million in television advertising time on Tennessee\u2019s airwaves from the late spring through the early-August primary. Blackburn was among the Republicans who attended the California retreat hosted by the Koch brothers\u2019 powerful donor network last month. She was among the first candidates to get a check from Vice President Mike Pence when he launched a political action committee in November. The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List rolled out its endorsement of Blackburn on Tuesday. And Republican sources pointed out that the GOP is in dire need of more women in its predominantly male Senate caucus. Corker is perhaps best known nationally for his feud with Trump. Trump claimed in October that Corker \u201cbegged\u201d for his endorsement and \u201cdidn\u2019t have the guts\u201d to run for re-election. He said Corker was responsible for the Iran nuclear deal \u2013 which Trump has opposed \u2013 and \u201cthat\u2019s about it.\u201d \u201cI would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn\u2019t have the guts to run!\u201d Trump tweeted. Corker responded in a tweet of his own: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why he lowers himself to such a low, low standard, and debases our country in a way that he does, but he does,\u201d Corker told CNN in October. Corker\u2019s words have manifested themselves in his voting pattern in Congress. In legislation and nominations that have been voted upon in the Senate, Corker has voted against the President more times than all but four Republican senators. He was the only Republican senator, for example, to vote against the initial version of the Republican tax cut. His voting pattern most closely resembles that of Sen. John McCain and Sen. Lisa Murkowski who voted against the Republican health care plan. Corker\u2019s defiance of Trump might be more acceptable to Republicans if he were from a blue or even purple state, but Tennessee is very red: No Democrat has won a Senate race there since Al Gore in 1990. Corker could face a fate similar to former Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar if he runs for re-election. Lugar, the last elected senator to lose in a primary, faced an ad onslaught from Republican Richard Mourdock and groups supporting him. This caused Lugar\u2019s one time lead in the polls to disappear and Lugar\u2019s net favorability rating to drop 16 points in a month to 0 points. Even before facing any primary ads against him, Corker would start in worse shape. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \u2013 facing similar problems \u2013 opted to retire rather than seek re-election this year. Still, tensions between Trump and Corker appear to have eased. After facing scrutiny over how he\u2019d personally benefit from the GOP tax bill, Corker told Fox News he had \u201cnewfound empathy\u201d for Trump. The two spoke several times over the phone in the months after their public feud, CNN reported in January, and raised eyebrows when they traveled together aboard Air Force One to Tennessee for a football game early last month. Another Tennessee Republican who was on that flight: Marsha Blackburn. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Harry Enten contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is expected to campaign for Rick Saccone, a Republican state lawmaker running for a US House seat in Pennsylvania, later this month, according to a White House official and several other people familiar with the President\u2019s plans. The White House is eying February 21 for the President to travel to Pittsburgh to stump for Saccone in the special election in March for Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District. The seat was held by Rep. Tim Murphy, who resigned in October after reports surfaced alleging that the anti-abortion rights Republican urged a woman he was having an affair with to have an abortion. Murphy did not return CNN\u2019s request for comment at the time. He had previously said he would not seek reelection at the end of his term. Last month, the President tweeted that he was giving his \u201ctotal support to RICK SACCONE,\u201d calling Saccone \u201ca great guy.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet came in advance of a company tour in Pittsburgh, though his staff later said the visit to Pennsylvania was part of official White House business and not a campaign stop. Vice President Mike Pence appeared alongside Saccone last week at a fundraising event that raised $250,000, according to a source close to Pence. This will be the first GOP candidate that Trump has campaigned with since Republican Roy Moore\u2019s stunning loss to Democrat Doug Jones in the special Senate election in Alabama in December. Advisers inside and outside the White House have emphasized a less-risky approach for endorsements in 2018, saying that Trump and Pence will not weigh in on primaries.",

            "article_content": "Several Democratic retirements have given Republicans big openings But in a wave election, the GOP seats will be among the most hotly contested UPDATE: This story was updated Wednesday after California Rep. Darrell Issa announced his retirement. Democrats searching for the 24 seats they need to flip to win control of the House in the 2018 midterms are increasingly seeing openings in districts where tough-to-beat Republicans are retiring. So far, 32 House Republicans are either retiring or running for other offices. That\u2019s more than double the 15 Democrats who are not running for re-election. Rep. Ed Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Darrell Issa, the former House oversight chairman, joined the list of retirees this week. Rep. Martha McSally is set to become the 33rd departure when she launches her Senate campaign Friday. Why do retirements matter so much? Because it\u2019s much harder for the challenging party \u2014 in 2018\u2019s case, the Democrats \u2014 to beat an incumbent than to win an open seat. The Cook Political Report has useful data that lays this out. There are several Democratic retirements that have given Republicans big openings, too: Minnesota Rep. Tim Walz\u2019s departure could allow the GOP to take a district that President Donald Trump won by 15 points in 2016. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter\u2019s New Hampshire district has a long history of switching hands. And Rep. Jacky Rosen\u2019s decision to run for the Senate in Nevada opens up a competitive seat there, as well. But in a wave election \u2014 the kind that crashed the 1994, 2006 and 2010 midterms and could be building amid a backlash to Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the Republican-held seats will be among the most hotly contested in the country. Here are the 10 biggest Republican retirements so far, ranked in order of how significantly they shook up the House battleground map: Welcome to Orange County, the most important region on the 2018 House map, with five Republican-held seats in the area that Democrats are targeting. Royce cruised to re-election by 14 percentage points in 2016 despite Democrat Hillary Clinton winning his district by 9 points. So the announcement Monday that Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will retire means Democrats suddenly have a huge opportunity to capitalize on this educated, diverse, suburban region\u2019s rapid move leftward over recent elections. Not having to face the $3.5 million Royce had in the bank makes it even better news for Democrats. Republicans have several options here with local and state-level experience. But six Democrats are in the race, including Gil Cisneros, a $266 million lottery winner, and Andy Thornburn, a health insurance executive who has loaned his own campaign $2 million. Another tough-to-beat Republican incumbent is leaving a seat where Democrats have had a recent advantage. Clinton won Reichert\u2019s suburban Seattle district by 3 points and former President Barack Obama bested Mitt Romney here by 2 points in 2012. Republican interim state senator and perennial candidate Dino Rossi will try to hold the seat against one of the nine Democratic candidates currently running. LoBiondo won his seat in the 1994 wave election and rarely slipped below 60% in his re-election campaigns. So even though his district went for Trump by 5 points in 2016, his retirement is a major opportunity for Democrats \u2013 particularly since Obama carried the district by 8 points in 2012. The leading Democratic candidate is one of the party\u2019s top recruits in the nation: state Sen. Jeff Van Drew, who is likely too conservative for many progressives but is well-known in the district. Issa barely held on in 2016, winning by a little more than 1,600 votes \u2013 less than a percentage point \u2013 in a district Clinton carried by 8 points. Headed into a potential rematch against Douglas Applegate (or one of the three other Democrats in the race), Issa announced Wednesday that he\u2019ll retire instead. Southern California is diverse, educated and rapidly moving leftward. Republicans will turn to Diane Harkey, a member of the state Board of Equalization. But this coastal district that stretches from Orange County to San Diego was already poised to be one of the toughest for the GOP to hold in the country. That looks even tougher now. McSally faced a difficult race against Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick, who ran for the Senate against John McCain in 2016, in a Tucson-based district Clinton won by 5 points. So she opted for a run for retiring Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s seat instead. McSally is set to announce her candidacy Friday, Republicans familiar with her plans told CNN. Republicans are optimistic about Lea M\u00e1rquez-Peterson, the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce president. But with McSally yet to make her plans official, the field might not yet have fully developed. This is a huge opportunity for Democrats to pick off a district that already ought to be in their column: Clinton won it by 20 points \u2014 even as the popular Ros-Lehtinen was re-elected by 10 points \u2014 and Obama won by 7 points in 2012. In what looks increasingly like a wave election, the math suggests this Miami-area district should be among the first to flip, no matter who emerges from both parties\u2019 crowded primary fields. This district \u2014 which loops awkwardly around Detroit in a prime example of gerrymandering \u2014 is Republican-leaning, but not by much. Trump won here by 4 points in 2016 and Romney won by 5 points in 2012. Among the five Democratic candidates, technology executive Suneel Gupta raised $500,000 in the last quarter and state Rep. Tim Greimel is also running. Perhaps the most interesting Democrat is Haley Stevens, who ended 2017 with $650,000 on hand. She\u2019s the former chief of staff of the Obama administration\u2019s Auto Task Force \u2013 a powerful resume line in the district that\u2019s home to Chrysler. Former Rep. Kerry Bentivolio, who lost his seat to Trott in a 2014 primary, is among the Republicans running now that Trott is retiring. Dent\u2019s Lehigh Valley clearly leans rightward, thanks to the presence of Democratic voters who are more conservative than most nationally: Trump won it by 8 points, and Romney won it by 3 points. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli joined the Democratic field of six other candidates this week. Five Republicans are also in the race, including state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie. Why is a district that Trump won by 18 points on this list? Mostly because of the presence of former state House Minority Leader Paul Davis as the leading Democrat in the race. State Sens. Caryn Tyson and Steve Fitzgerald and state Rep. Kevin Jones are among the Republican candidates. Pearce\u2019s decision to run for governor gives Democrats an opportunity in the southern half of New Mexico, where Trump won by 10 points and Romney won by 7 points in 2012. This district belongs firmly in the \u201cwave watch\u201d category. If it flips, then Democrats have probably taken the House \u2013 and it\u2019s probably not that close. (Another fit in this category is the Florida 6th, where Rep. Ron DeSantis is running for governor and Democrats are high on Nancy Soderberg, a former ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser under President Bill Clinton.) This is a special election to replace Rep. Tim Murphy set for March 18. It\u2019s a heavily Republican district that Trump won by 20 points \u2013 but Murphy resigned in disgrace amid allegations that he had an extramarital affair with a woman who he then encouraged to have an abortion. Democratic 33-year-old former federal prosecutor Conor Lamb takes on Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone. Lamb has said he wouldn\u2019t support Rep. Nancy Pelosi for House speaker. Are Republicans worried? The Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC has opened two offices in the district. This one \u2013 like a spate of House special elections in 2017 \u2013 looks like it could break optimistic Democrats\u2019 hearts. But a Lamb win would send the national GOP into panic mode. This story has been updated to reflect new developments.",

            "article_content": "Jones was sworn in as a senator from Alabama on Wednesday He will be watched for how closely he ties himself to Trump or the liberal base When Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones went before his cheering supporters the night of his improbable election in deeply Republican Alabama last month, he smiled widely and then hesitated. \u201cI have been waiting my whole life and now I don\u2019t know what the hell to say,\u201d he said with a laugh. Congress is back, and here's what's on the agenda The 63-year-old former federal prosecutor was sworn in Wednesday by Vice President Mike Pence, cutting the GOP majority to a slim 51-49 advantage, and everyone in Washington will be paying close attention to his every move in the coming weeks. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was also sworn in, replacing Sen. Al Franken who stepped down Tuesday, following allegations that he touched women inappropriately. Will Jones toe a conservative line, and even side with President Donald Trump at times? Or will he stay close to the liberal core of the Senate Democratic caucus, as progressive activists and many aides and advisers from that party expect after defeating Republican Roy Moore? Republicans already struggle to pass their legislation and it could be even harder now with Jones in the Senate, unless they can convince their new red state colleague to split with Democrats and vote with them on key issues like spending and entitlements. Jones made clear during his campaign \u2013 his first run for elected office \u2013 that he wanted to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d with Republicans. Such a bipartisan approach might concern Democrats, who are eager to seize on the anti-Trump sentiment in the country and use it to win back control of Congress in November. But on most key issues, like health care, gay rights and gun control, Jones\u2019 views are in line with those of many other Democrats. He is even in favor of abortion rights, a delicate reality for a politician from Alabama. Trump begged Orrin Hatch to run again. The senator retired anyway. A handful of other moderate Democrats from red states \u2013 like Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2013 could be likely allies of Jones. They are all facing re-election in states Trump won and have learned to navigate the unusual political dynamics presented by the President. Those Democrats stuck together on key votes over health care and taxes, showing they are not afraid to vote against Trump. \u201cBased on what I saw during (Jones\u2019) campaign, the Republican leadership shouldn\u2019t be expecting him to vote with them very many times,\u201d said Jim Manley, an aide to former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that in light of his election, Speaker (Paul) Ryan\u2019s desire to deal with such programs as Social Security and Medicare are dead on arrival in the Senate, because the votes are simply not there.\u201d Another Democratic aide agreed, saying Jones might be more of a middle-of-the-road Democratic legislator than someone who will flirt with Republicans to boost his re-election chances. \u201cHe\u2019s a solid Democrat, has been for a long time\u201d said the Democratic aide. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to feel compelled to back Republican ideas for the sake of bipartisanship when so many of them are unpopular even in red states.\u201d Marge Baker, a top official at the progressive organization People for the America Way, agreed. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of reason for optimism about Doug Jones\u2019 career in the Senate. He ran as a pro-choice, pro-Obamacare, common-sense leader,\u201d she said.  \u201cOn the issues where McConnell is having a harder time holding his caucus together, Senator Jones is going to make a very positive difference.\u201d A senior GOP aide said it\u2019s too early to know what kind of senator Jones will make but predicted he would struggle to be re-elected because he\u2019s a Democrat, pro-abortion rights and won the seat only because his controversial opponent, Moore, lost it. \u201cThe question is, will he vote in line with the conservative state he represents or as Sen. (Chuck) Schumer asks?\u201d the aide said, referring to the Senate Democratic leader from New York and previewing a likely constant attack line against Jones. However, veteran GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa warned that his party should not take Jones\u2019 victory lightly and said that if the new senator acts in a bipartisan way, it could be hard for Republicans to unseat him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to realize that the people of Alabama think differently than people from a lot of states that a lot Democrats represent, and he\u2019s going to do his darndest to represent them,\u201d Grassley told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I would predict that even though he comes from what\u2019s today a Republican state, that it will be hard to defeat him.\u201d \u201cIf he functions in a very bipartisan way, I think you\u2019d find it very difficult,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something Republicans can take for granted like we took that state for granted for the last 25 years.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Alabama upset follows recent victories in North Carolina and Louisiana There's evidence of a new Democratic coalition in the South With Doug Jones\u2019 upset victory in last week\u2019s Alabama US Senate race, Democrats are solidifying a new model for rebuilding their tattered competitiveness in the South. Jones benefited from the unique vulnerabilities of his opponent, Republican Roy Moore, who was a deeply polarizing figure even before he was besieged by allegations that he had pursued relationships with teenage girls, some of them underage, while in his 30s. But the coalition that Jones mobilized closely resembled the voter alignments that have powered other recent Democratic victories in governors\u2019 races in Virginia, North Carolina and Louisiana. Above all, Jones demonstrated that Democrats could simultaneously inspire passionate turnout from their base supporters, led by African-Americans, and make inroads with centrist white-collar white voters \u2013 each of which, for different reasons, is recoiling from Donald Trump\u2019s tumultuous presidency. That combination allowed Jones to overcome Moore\u2019s lopsided margins among blue-collar, evangelical, older and rural whites \u2013 the four building blocks of the Trump coalition. Keeping momentum and agreement among those groups won\u2019t be easy, but Democrats see it as a possible pathway to majorities in the 2018 midterm elections. \u201cIt was definitely the most complicated, toughest thing I\u2019ve ever been through, on the edge of your seat,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist who directed Jones\u2019 campaign. \u201c[But] Trump has created this middle ground where enough moderate and conservative Republicans and Democrats really want leadership about coming together and getting something done. \u2026 I think that is the winning message of 2018.\u201d Jones\u2019 victory was centered on minorities, millennial voters and college-educated suburban whites, especially women. That\u2019s exactly the formula Democrats now depend on in most states. But even with strong African-American support, Southern Democrats until recently come up short, largely because they haven\u2019t attracted nearly as many college-educated whites as their party does elsewhere. Now, with Democratic constituencies energized and suburban swing voters uneasy about Trump, Southern Democrats are suddenly finding it more possibe to assemble the coalition that the party relies on in other regions. And that could create new opportunities for Democrats across the South, most immediately in suburban House districts in 2018, but potentially also in statewide contests such as the 2018 governor\u2019s race in Georgia and Senate battle in Tennessee. \u201cI am not going to say that any place is going to be noncompetitive next year,\u201d says Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who has long specialized in Southern races. \u201cIt all depends on the environment and how it shifts over the course of the next year, but it\u2019s hard to see it getting a whole lot more favorable for Republicans with Donald Trump as the face of the party.\u201d Democrats still face a long road to re-establishing competitiveness across the South. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in all 11 states of the old Confederacy except for Virginia, typically by enormous margins. (Only a year before Jones\u2019 win, Trump carried Alabama by nearly 28 percentage points and 590,000 votes.) Even after Jones\u2019 win, Democrats still hold just four of the region\u2019s 22 Senate seats (including Mark Warner and Tim Kaine in Virginia and Bill Nelson in Florida). And Democrats control just three of the 11 Southern governor\u2019s mansions. Yet Jones\u2019 victory continued a modest Southern Democratic revival that includes those three governor wins: one in 2017 (Ralph Northam in Virginia), one in 2016 (Roy Cooper in North Carolina) and the last in 2015 (John Bel Edwards in Louisiana.) Even as they embraced most traditional Democratic priorities \u2013 such as expanding access to Medicaid, defending the Affordable Care Act and ensuring equal treatment for gays \u2013 each of those four candidates ran primarily as a consensus-builder in an increasingly polarized age. While defending the ACA, opposing the GOP tax plan and affirming his support for legal abortion, Jones promised to seek common ground where possible with Trump and Republicans \u2013 a message he repeated on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d this Sunday. The most memorable television ad of Jones\u2019 campaign was a spot called \u201cHonor\u201d in which, speaking directly to the camera, he praised \u201ctwo brave men\u201d who fought on the Confederate and Union sides at Gettysburg during the Civil War and declared, \u201cThere is honor in compromise and civility.\u201d Trippi said Jones faced criticism from some Democratic activists who wanted a more pugnacious approach to Trump. But, he added, there was no evidence that Jones\u2019 call for common ground depressed turnout among the core Democratic groups. \u201cThat message didn\u2019t keep the lid on our own energy and excitement,\u201d Trippi said. \u201cYou get more angst from activist leaders than you do [from] voters. You gain far more than [you lose from] the few loud voices that don\u2019t like working with the other side.\u201d Indeed, Jones achieved two broad campaign goals that some on the left have viewed as incompatible. On the one hand, he was buoyed by big turnouts and huge margins among core Democratic constituencies. That was especially true among African-Americans, who made up slightly more of the vote, and voted slightly more heavily Democratic, last week than they did when President Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, according to exit polls. But Jones also benefited from respectable turnout and a commanding margin among young voters, who gave him fully three-fifths of their votes. (He received a thumb on the scale, too, from the 5% of voters who were neither white nor black, a reflection of the increasing Hispanic, Asian and mixed race presence throughout the Southeast.) John Anzalone, an Alabama-based Democratic pollster who worked on an independent expenditure effort supporting Jones, says that while Moore won very high percentages in his rural strongholds, they could not match the enhanced turnout in more urbanized Democratic-leaning areas. \u201cWe turned out where we had to turn out our voters, and even though he did really well in his strongholds the turnout wasn\u2019t big enough,\u201d Anzalone said. \u201cWe are getting people who have never come out in a midterm or special election, and they are disproportionately our people.\u201d Jones also made deeper inroads among white-collar white voters, such as those in suburbs around Huntsville and Birmingham, than Southern Democrats have usually achieved. In 2016, for instance, exit polls showed that Clinton carried 45% of college-educated whites nationally but only about one-third or less in Florida, Texas and Georgia. In 2014, Democratic Senate candidates didn\u2019t win more than one-third of college-educated whites in any Southern state with an exit poll except North Carolina and Virginia. In 2012, the last time an exit poll was conducted in Alabama, Obama won only one-fifth of college-educated whites there. Last week, though, the exit poll found that Jones won 40% of college-educated whites in Alabama, double Obama\u2019s share. That reaffirmed the movement evident in the Virginia race, where Northam reached 51% among college-educated whites, considerably more than Democrats had garnered in any recent statewide race there. Although exit polls weren\u2019t available in the June special election for a suburban House seat outside of Atlanta, Democrat Jon Ossoff could not have finished so close to Republican Karen Handel, the narrow winner, without significant gains among those voters too. The movement toward Southern Democrats this year has been greatest among college-educated white women in both Virginia (where Northam carried 58% of them) and Alabama (where Jones took 45%). But each gained substantially among well-educated men too. Ayres says the intense distaste for Trump among college-educated white women represents a clear and present danger for any Republican who must court a heavily suburban constituency, even in the South. \u201cIf you put Alabama together with Virginia, it\u2019s very clear that college-educated suburban women are rejecting Trump and his style and what he has brought to the country,\u201d Ayres said. \u201c[This] is a logical extension of the patterns we saw in the presidential election in 2016. Republicans traded fast growing, large, better-educated counties for slow growing, smaller less well-educated counties. And it was a trade that worked well for Trump, barely, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, but it\u2019s hardly a formula for long-term success.\u201d Even amid these gains, the big blinking yellow light for Democrats is the continuing Republican hold on the blue-collar, evangelical and rural voters who play such a large role in many Southern states. Trippi said that while Trump\u2019s combative persona helped mobilize African-Americans and young people, and enlarged the opening for Jones with white-collar whites, the President showed a potent capacity to tug his coalition back toward Moore whenever it appeared to waver. \u201cHe has this weird thing where he would help fuel our positive message [on working together] and then he would roll in and create the tribalism that would help them all move back to Moore,\u201d Trippi said. Still, Jones \u2013 like Ralph Northam and Roy Cooper before him \u2013 wasn\u2019t annihilated among working-class white voters by quite as large a margin as Clinton or Obama or most Southern Democratic Senate candidates in 2014. Trippi said the campaign\u2019s research found that Trump\u2019s \u201cdivisive negative style \u2026 was starting to wear even on\u201d those voters, who have been Trump\u2019s most loyal. Democrats still face many obstacles in the South. But Trump\u2019s turbulent presidency may be creating more opportunity than almost anyone anticipated for the party to begin overcoming them.",

The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinions on CNN. After an election in which more than 100 women were elected to Congress, Nevada voters eliminated the state\u2019s \u201ctampon tax,\u201d and according to some exit polls, two-thirds of those who voted in the midterms support Roe v. Wade, the American people have made one thing overwhelmingly clear: women deserve and are capable of being in positions of power, whether it\u2019s in Washington, DC or in their doctors\u2019 offices. Yet two extreme anti-abortion measures passed in Alabama and West Virginia on Election day, both of which could criminalize certain forms of contraception and fertility treatment along with abortion care, if Roe v. Wade is ever struck down. And the day after the midterms, the Trump administration issued new rules allowing employers to deny contraceptive coverage, despite several pending lawsuits and two federal courts blocking them. This administration and the GOP are ignoring the overwhelming majority of Americans who want access to contraception, abortion, and other modern sexual health services and education. Reproductive freedom isn\u2019t controversial; the majority of voters support abortion and over 99% of women ages 15-44 who have had sexual intercourse have used at least one method of contraception, according to the Guttmacher Institute. But here we are, in 2018, living in a country without mandatory paid family leave and the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world, home to 15 million children living in poverty and paying mothers less than fathers and women without children. Yet the political party in power, touting \u201cfamily values,\u201d is more focused on curtailing abortion rights, attacking access to birth control, and creating a cultural fissure where one simply does not exist. Two states passed abortion amendments to their constitutions in the midterm. What does that mean? According to the Pew Research Center, most Americans \u2013 72% of women and 62% of men \u2013 believe employers should be required to provide birth control coverage in employee health insurance plans. Yet this administration has repeatedly attempted to repeal the birth control mandate initially set by President Barack Obama, first issuing a plan to \u201ccircumvent the mandate\u201d a year ago. Using pseudo-science and outright falsehoods to justify their continued attack on contraception coverage and access \u2013 from claiming birth control doesn\u2019t really reduce unwanted pregnancies and leads to riskier sex, to inflating the so-called \u201charms\u201d of birth control pills \u2013 the Trump administration clearly aims to curtail reproductive freedom not because that\u2019s what the majority of Americans want, but because it appeases a religious base that helped elect President Donald Trump in the first place. Trump was previously pro-choice before running for president and becoming aware of the voting power of far-right evangelicals. \u201cI\u2019m very pro-choice,\u201d Trump said in 1999 during an appearance on \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d \u201cI am pro-choice in every respect.\u201d NYT: Trump administration plans new rule challenge to Obamacare birth control mandate Trump is now singing a different tune, and along with Vice President Mike Pence, has emboldened anti-choice politicians to introduce, and in some cases pass, an unprecedented amount of anti-abortion legislations \u2013 most recently, the state constitutional amendments passed in West Virginia and Alabama. If Roe v. Wade falls as the result of Trump\u2019s appointed anti-choice judges, abortion will automatically become illegal in both states. This political grandstanding has consequences, of course, and it will be young people, women, trans men and non-binary individuals, and particularly black people and other people of color who pay the price. Limited access to birth control will mean an increase in unwanted pregnancies and, in places where abortion access isn\u2019t severely restricted, an increase in the number of people who seek abortion services. In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, teenagers who were given contraception were less likely to get pregnant or have abortions compared to those who did not. The teen birth rate dropped to an all-time low in 2017, and the rates of abortion also dropped to an historic low in the same year, all due to access to increased access to contraception and evidence-based, comprehensive sex education. It's not the 'Year of the Woman.' It's the 'Year of the Women' Experts say those who cannot terminate their unwanted pregnancies due to limited abortion access experience more anxiety, lower self-esteem, and less life satisfaction compared to women who obtain abortion services. Women who are denied abortions are more likely to live in poverty, and according to a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, women refused an abortion \u201cwere more likely than those who had an abortion to report not having enough money to cover basic living expenses.\u201d According to a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics, children who are born to women who were denied abortions are less likely to reach developmental milestones, more likely to live in poverty, and experience significantly less maternal bonding than the children of women who had abortions and were able to start their families when they were ready and willing. Michelle Obama opens up about infertility Denying access to contraception and abortion services is bad for the mental, physical, and financial health of women and their families, but this administration and the GOP are willing to watch American citizens endure those consequences if it means placating their base and maintaining political power. But we know that Democrats, Republicans, rich, poor, religious, atheist \u2013 everyone has abortions, and everyone knows and loves someone who has had an abortion. Continuing to attack reproductive freedom by blocking abortion access and limiting access to contraception isn\u2019t the will of the people, but a priority on the agenda of a small few in positions of power who want to stir widespread anger and deny Americans access to medical care to hold onto that power.  In a country already facing so many great divides, we don\u2019t need our politicians sowing further division about contraception. We need them to protect our inalienable right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Because for so many of us, birth control and abortion are contained in the word liberty.",

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. President Donald Trump loves to complain about how the media doesn\u2019t give him credit for his accomplishments. Well, let me correct that right now. Trump absolutely, unequivocally deserves credit for one big thing: Making the Democratic party great again. This achievement deserves its own hashtag #MDGA and maybe even a blue hat with the embroidered slogan that Trump could give away or, in traditional Trump fashion, sell on his website. Midterm results that will shape America's future In fact, Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders should send Trump a fruit basket or 10 for helping them succeed at something they haven\u2019t been able to achieve since 2010 \u2013 taking control of the House. This alone is a tremendous accomplishment. Every House committee come January 2019 can have a Democrat as chair.  The party will also be able to set the House\u2019s legislative agenda and engage in oversight of the Trump administration, including over Trump himself for possible violations of the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause. And Democrats won a handful of governorships that had been held by Republicans, including in Kansas where Democrat Laura Kelly beat Kris Kobach, who Trump had appointed to co-chair his now-abandoned voter fraud commission. All of that is thanks to the President.  Although we can\u2019t take away from the great Democratic candidates we saw this election cycle who worked tirelessly to win, some of the candidates ran this year in reaction to Trump. As I heard first-hand when speaking to Democratic congressional candidates, from New Jersey to Texas to California, on my SiriusXM radio show, Trump\u2019s election spurred them to want to do more than just vote or be active in local politics \u2013 to seek congressional office as a form of resistance to his right-wing policies and his bigoted and sexist views.  And as Emily\u2019s List, a Democratic organization that supports women candidates in favor of abortion rights, noted, the surge in interest by women to run for office in 2018 came in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s 2016 win. Why this 'blue wave' was not a tsunami That\u2019s why we saw so many firsts on Tuesday. We witnessed the first Muslim woman elected to Congress - in fact, the first two, Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar, both Democrats.  Then there\u2019s Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley and Connecticut\u2019s Jahana Hayes, who not only became the first black women to be elected to Congress from their respective states but from the entire New England region. But despite Trump almost making the Democratic party completely great again (Democrats lost ground in the Senate), in fairness it can also be said that President Obama helped make the GOP great \u2013 or at least helped rebuild itself. And the same case can me be made about George W. Bush helping rebuild the Democratic Party and even playing a role in Obama\u2019s 2008 victory. The reality is that when voters want to send a message that they aren\u2019t happy with the President, they vote against the President\u2019s party in the midterm elections.  Look what happened to Obama in his first midterm election in 2010 shortly after the ACA passed which then was very unpopular. Going into the 2010 election, Democrats controlled the House and the Senate. But after the votes were all counted, the Democrats lost a whopping 63 House seats and control of the House, plus six Senate seats.  And by the time Obama left office, Democrats had lost control of the Senate and Republicans picked up nearly 1,000 state legislative seats overall.  Same scenario with Bush, but in his second midterm in 2006. Despite a solid economy, Bush\u2019s handling of the Iraq war soured Americans, leaving Bush with an approval rating in the area of 38% that election year.  American voters sent Bush a message in that midterm election by making the Democratic Party pretty great again. The Democrats remarkably regained control of the House for the first time in 12 years in addition to seizing control of the Senate. And Democrats even flipped six governorships, taking control of 28 nationwide. Now the big question going forward is: Does Trump make the Democratic Party really great again by helping the party win the White House and control of the Senate in 2020?  Given Trump\u2019s track record, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a pretty good shot that the hashtag #MDGA will be trending come 2020.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: In a new series of weekly columns (available soon as a newsletter), we\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. A Taylor Swift bump, a Nikki Haley bombshell, some bad-new polls for Republicans about women voters.  Women (and girls!) dominated the week\u2019s news. But Melania Trump and Michelle Obama had the most arresting turns in the spotlight, showing just how different two first ladies can be. Writing for CNN Opinion on the International Day of the Girl, Michelle Obama laid out a plan to change the world \u2013 by educating girls. She announced the Global Girls Alliance, a collaboration aimed at helping the more than 98 million adolescent girls worldwide whose futures are limited because they don\u2019t go to school.  At one school in Liberia, girls \u201cshow up even after walking for miles or waking up early to earn some extra money to help pay their school fees,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey show up even though many are pressured to marry as adolescents, sidetracking their own goals for a man\u2019s.\u201d Back from Africa, Melania Trump declared herself \u201cthe most bullied person\u201d in the world, before clarifying that she was just one of the most. She also said she \u201cstands with women\u201d who report sexual assault, as long as they have \u201creally hard evidence.\u201d A dangerous message, wrote former prosecutor Elie Honig, that discourages survivors from reporting crimes because they fear \u201cthey will be shamed, stigmatized or disbelieved.\u201d  (Just ask Christine Blasey Ford, wrote Brigid Schulte.) But there\u2019s more to this, wrote Lionel Shriver (in the Spectator), who was baffled when Ford\u2019s testimony that she was attacked by the teenaged Brett Kavanaugh made others cry. Ford\u2019s \u201cculture has encouraged her not to put that incident in perspective and get on with her life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI fear the deferent and visibly fragile academic with a high, mousy voice makes a lousy role model for young women today.\u201d And in the New York Times, Susan Chira said it\u2019s a mistake to think that sisterhood can \u201coverride partisanship or deeply held moral views.\u201d Women \u201cwon\u2019t vote as one \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason to be shocked by that,\u201d she wrote, citing the high percentage of women who broke for Donald Trump in the last election. Are Democrats too nice? Michelle Obama told an interviewer Thursday that her motto, \u201cwhen they go low, we go high,\u201d still stands. Only it doesn\u2019t work, former AG Eric Holder told a rally in Georgia. \u201cWhen they go low, we kick them,\u201d he explained. And Hillary Clinton told CNN: \u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for.\u201d  No!, wrote progressive Sally Kohn. \u201cI\u2019m not with her. Or him. I\u2019m still with Michelle Obama\u2026Do we only believe the high road is the right choice if it leads to victory? Are our principles that conditional?\u201d A new CNN poll this week offered good news for Democrats anyway \u2013 thanks to women \u2013and \u201cif Democrats are smart, they won\u2019t just ride this pink wave, \u201d writes Jill Filipovic, they\u2019ll come up with a 2020 \u201cplatform that doesn\u2019t just take women into account, but puts us first.\u201d with paid family leave, better protections against workplace harassment, and more. Reproductive rights, \u201cincluding abortion, should not even be up for debate.\u201d UN Ambassador Nikki Haley surprised just about everybody by announcing that she\u2019s quitting at the end of the year.  Uh-oh, wrote SE Cupp. She sensed \u201cpalpable\u201d anxiety at the loss of \u201cone of the more stabilizing forces in an otherwise chaotic Trump orbit.\u201d  As the speculation over Haley\u2019s successor began, David Graham, in the Atlantic, called her one of the \u201cadults in the room.\u201d Don\u2019t kid yourself about Haley, wrote Michael Knigge in DW. She was no moderate, he said, but \u201can ardent supporter of Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy,\u201d someone \u201cat odds with the core principles of the UN.\u201d  On her \u201cbleak\u201d watch, the US killed its funding for the UN Population Fund, which provides health care to pregnant women and girls in besieged areas, and reinstated the so-called Global Gag Rule. Taylor Swift told her 112 million Instagram followers that she was endorsing two Tennessee Democrats, Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the House. Vote!, she wrote. A day later, 65,000 people had registered, said Vote.org (there is often an influx of people registering to vote just ahead of deadlines, but the site tagged Swift with the lift anyway). The pop star is not stupid, wrote Patrick Crowley in Billboard: \u201cWhile critics will still whine that she\u2019s late to the party, this particular endorsement couldn\u2019t be more impeccably timed.\u201d She\u2019s getting out the vote when and where it matters, in a tight midterm race in a red state. Carrie Sheffield objected. She said Swift\u2019s endorsements \u2013 and her slam of the GOP Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn \u2013 lacked \u201crigorous, critical thinking.\u201d \u201cUnder Republican leadership (with Blackburn\u2019s support) we are seeing increased black, Latino and female economic empowerment, including record low unemployment among African Americans,\u201d Sheffield wrote. And President Trump? \u201cI like Taylor\u2019s music about 25% less now, OK?,\u201d he told reporters. Three days later he hosted Kanye West in the Oval Office, where the rapper delivered a disjointed MAGA monologue for the cameras. \u201cHigh-octane foolishness\u201d from a man-child, lamented Clay Cane.  \u201cLet the image of Kanye jumping into the arms of the President in the Oval Office while people are suffering through a hurricane inspire you to get out and vote.\u201d Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi writer and Washington Post columnist, walked into the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul Oct. 2 and did not come out. Turkish officials believe a Saudi assassination squad murdered him. Saudi officials denied it. Trump was vague about it and did not condemn his Saudi friends. \u201cIn previous years, something such as this might have been addressed with a firm hand from the White House,\u201d wrote Nic Robertson. But Trump has ignored Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s increasingly autocratic behavior, Robertson said, and \u201cin doing so, he has become a role model to all the wrong people and for all the wrong reasons.\u201d Peter Bergen wrote that Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance cast a spotlight on the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cwarm embrace\u201d of the Crown Prince. MBS is a key figure in Trumpian policy in the Middle East and is posing as a moderate despite his bourgeoning totalitarian dictatorship. \u201cIf evidence emerges that Khashoggi was indeed murdered in Istanbul, US sanctions should be levied on the kingdom,\u201d Bergen said. USAToday published a falsehood-riddled op-ed by President Donald Trump denouncing Democrats on health care, calling them \u201cradical socialists who want to model America\u2019s economy after Venezuela,\u201d \u201cdestroy American prosperity\u201d and \u201cslash budgets for seniors\u2019 Medicare, Social Security and defense.\u201d  Many people were astounded that a newspaper would publish a piece without thoroughly checking it for accuracy (something USA Today itself effectively confirmed, in a 2,900-word Factcheck.org follow-up.)  \u201cI can\u2019t help but smile,\u201d wrote Jim Himes, a Connecticut congressman.  \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense top to bottom\u2026 a tacit admission that his policies can\u2019t stand up to ours in the court of public opinion.\u201d  He predicted that centrist Democrats would help sweep in a Democratic majority next month, by \u201cbacking reforms that would strengthen the system we have today, not running on Medicare-for-all as Republicans want voters to believe.\u201d \u201cIt takes someone special, someone rare, someone spectacularly Machiavellian and malevolent, to screw up all three branches of government. Ladies and gentlemen: Mitch McConnell.\u201d In the wake of Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s contentious confirmation, Paul Begala wrote that Senate Majority Leader effectively quashed pre-election intelligence reports that Russia was trying to help Trump win the presidency, blocked Merrick Garland\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, and rammed through an unpopular Brett Kavanaugh. \u201cYou can thank the \u2018Gentleman from Kentucky\u2019\u201d for the \u201cbitter, hateful, vengeful hyperpartisanship infecting our national life,\u201d he says. But in Washington, all sins are forgiven. \u201cMeet Brett,\u201d wrote Lev Golinkin.  \u201cBrett [Kavanaugh] once worked for Ken Starr, who set out to publicly humiliate Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the most vicious way possible. Bill was forgiven, including by many feminists.\u201d So were Starr, Clarence Thomas, Joe Biden, and George W. Bush.  Brett may have muffed his big job interview, wrote Golinkin \u2013 but the takeaway is that the powerful give a pass to their own. And on International Day of the Girl, Fatemah Qaderyan, 15, wrote that she knows all about \u201climits placed on girls and women.\u201d Her all-girls Afghan robotics team won the silver medal at a D.C. competition last year, and a week later her father was killed in an ISIS bombing. \u201cHe never stopped believing in me, I will never stop believing in a brighter future for the next generation of girls in Afghanistan.\u201d",

In the lead-up to the midterm elections, a new CNN poll offers some good news for Democrats \u2013 thanks to women. Voters favor a generic Democratic candidate over a generic Republican 54% to 41%, with 62% of Democrats saying they are \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d or \u201cextremely enthusiastic\u201d about voting this year. But the Democratic edge is not gender-neutral: While male voters are closely divided \u2013 half say they will support a Republican, 45% a Democrat \u2013 63% of women say they will vote Democratic. Women are also more enthusiastic about voting this year than men, an important shift from previous elections. In other words, any impending Democratic victory will likely be thanks to women. But we aren\u2019t just voting. A record number of us are running for office this year. Female donors are giving more money than ever to midterm races. We are working on campaigns, door-knocking, fundraising, and showing up at marches and protests. If Democrats are smart, they won\u2019t just ride this pink wave; they\u2019ll put women\u2019s interests, and women themselves, at the forefront of the party\u2019s politics. CNN poll: Democrats are fired up and maintain a strong 2018 lead Democrats have long enjoyed support from women, but since the election of Donald Trump, that support has grown. Millennial women are especially drawn leftward: Fewer than a quarter of us identify as Republican or lean Republican, while 70% identify or lean Democratic, according to a Pew survey. Democratic popularity is also driven by race and education. The number of white women who support the GOP is waning, largely thanks to the college-educated, who have thrown their support behind Democrats. And black women are an integral component of the party\u2019s backbone and are among its strongest supporters. If Democrats want to harness our energy going forward, they need to make women less of an interest group and more of a default interest. Still, even in progressive circles, women are treated as a kind of other, our interests deemed secondary to more traditional (and male-oriented) priorities \u2013 things our leaders will get around to eventually, as long as we wait our turn. What if women\u2019s lives were at the heart of the Democratic Party, and our experiences were treated as the American norm? If the party wants to keep us, that\u2019s what needs to happen. Yes, these House and Senate elections are more about staving off further Trump-fueled mayhem than moving progressive legislation forward. But at the state and city levels, there is much the party can do, especially in more progressive enclaves. And the national party can begin organizing now for 2020, and putting together a platform that doesn\u2019t just take women into account, but puts us first. Women are angry at Trump and his party. And it's not just about Kavanaugh That means taking a strong stance against harassment and abuse \u2013 unwaveringly opposing the elevation of men who have either been proven abusive or who stand accused but inadequately investigated. And politicians who support the elevation of alleged abusers without a thorough investigation, like West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and the Republican senators who voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, should face tougher scrutiny. It also means crafting laws that better protect women from abuse and harassment, and giving us greater resources to counter bad treatment where we see it, especially in the workplace. Democrats must also bring us into the 21st century on paid family leave, which disproportionately impacts women, as well as a fair minimum wage. Worker protections need to address the many female workers who are domestic laborers, contract workers, or who work for minimum wage in restaurants and in retail. Reproductive rights, including abortion, should not even be up for debate, and certainly not up for compromise.  And finally, the Democratic Party needs to support women running for office and make a concerted effort to get to at least 50-50 gender parity (and frankly, given that their base is female and of-color, the party\u2019s representatives should have white men in the minority). Even if all the women running for office win this year, we still won\u2019t have anything near gender equality in the House or the Senate. That doesn\u2019t change organically; it requires effort and investment. Women are sending a clear message: We are fed up with Trump, and will show up at the ballot box in November. But after that, the people we vote for need to show up for us.",

He is the author of \u201cNixon\u2019s Court: His Challenge to Judicial Liberalism and Its Political Consequences.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Now that Brett Kavanaugh has taken a seat on the Supreme Court, what might we expect? To help answer this question, it is useful to employ a modified version of then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s quote about \u201cknowns\u201d and \u201cunknowns.\u201d \u201cThere are known knowns; there are things we know we know\u201d: Justice Kavanaugh is a conservative. While there is some disagreement about how conservative, every analysis I\u2019ve read puts him at least to the right of Chief Justice John Roberts. This means that he is expected to join the chief and the other three Republican appointed justices to move the court to the right in clear and distinct terms over the next decade or so. After all, as a group, these five conservatives are quite young by historical comparisons. The oldest, Clarence Thomas, is 70, a full fifteen years younger than the oldest liberal justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The new swing justice \u2013 representing the ideological middle of the court and replacing the retiring Anthony Kennedy \u2013 will likely be Chief Justice Roberts. And while Roberts has angered conservatives on occasion, particularly with his decision upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), he is generally quite conservative. With this group of five in place, the list of cases likely in line for elimination or significant reconstruction is fairly well known: Roe v. Wade (abortion), Grutter v. Bollinger (affirmative action), and Morrison v. Olson (presidential power), among others. \u201cWe also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know\u201d: Will Justice Kavanaugh succumb to the so-called Greenhouse Effect? The list of victims rolls off the tongues of conservative critics: Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and David Souter are among the most prominent. They were all justices appointed by Republican presidents who, once on the high bench, proved to be more liberal than expected when appointed. Conservatives were so perturbed by this phenomenon, they gave it a label: the \u201cGreenhouse Effect.\u201d But this has nothing to do with climate change. Rather, the idea is that newbies on the bench sought to please the liberal Eastern elite, and more specifically, Linda Greenhouse, the longtime \u2013 and now, former \u2013 Supreme Court reporter for the New York Times. When they did, they moved to the left. To combat this \u201cknown unknown,\u201d Republicans in the White House have targeted for selection to the Supreme Court candidates who have spent substantial time working in a Republican administration in Washington, believing these nominees would be less likely to be, as Richard Nixon put it earlier, \u201ctwisted by the Georgetown set.\u201d Trumpism is winning, and that's terrifying After all, Blackmun, Stevens, and Souter spent little of their pre-Supreme Court careers in the nation\u2019s capital. In fact, Blackmun and Souter did not work there at all. Stevens served for a year as a clerk at the Supreme Court, and another on the staff of the Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives. Notably, he did not work in the executive branch. In contrast, all of the current Republican-appointed justices have spent significant time working in DC \u2013 all during the early and formative parts of their legal careers, and all in the executive branch. In fact, soon after graduating from law school, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh centered their lives there. \u201cUnknown Unknowns.\u201d Things we do not and cannot know at this time, including: From the brokenness of defeat, what will progressives do? And more importantly, how will voters respond to what they do? Consider the following: On November 3, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson won one of the largest electoral landslides in the nation\u2019s history by capturing 61.05% of the popular vote; no one before or since has won a greater share of that vote. In addition, he secured the electoral votes of 44 states and the District of Columbia, losing only his opponent\u2019s home state and five states of the Deep South. Recall, the Congress had passed and LBJ signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act in July of that year, and white southern voters took out their anger on Johnson, a Texan. Exclusive club: Harvard, Yale and former clerks dominate Supreme Court The following year, LBJ named his good friend and leading liberal lawyer Abe Fortas to the  court, replacing the slightly more conservative Arthur Goldberg. In 1967, he chose legendary civil rights attorney and his current solicitor general, Thurgood Marshall, for a seat on the high bench, replacing the third most conservative justice at the time, Tom Clark. With the addition of Marshall, the new swing justice was William Brennan, who, as his biographers highlight in their book title, was a champion to liberals. But change was underfoot. Some of the Earl Warren-led court\u2019s decisions, particularly those expanding the rights of the accused, were deeply unpopular. At the same time, typical street crime was soaring, riots were raging in the nation\u2019s urban core, and anti-Vietnam War unrest was disrupting college campuses across the land. Into this space, Republican Richard Nixon unleashed an anti-Supreme Court \u201claw-and-order\u201d campaign. Third-party candidate George Wallace, the former and future governor of Alabama, joined in the court-bashing, including references to the nation\u2019s highest tribunal as a \u201csorry, lousy, no-account outfit.\u201d As I explain in my book, \u201cNixon\u2019s Court,\u201d Nixon\u2019s judicial strategy succeeded in not only pushing the court to the right on the issues he cared most about, it helped him build a Republican electoral majority. More specifically, Nixon\u2019s strategy appealed to disaffected Democrats living in the South and the urban and suburban North, and those voters \u2013 the latter mislabeled as \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d \u2013 would become essential components of a Republican coalition that would dominate presidential elections for the next two decades, only narrowly losing the Watergate-influenced race of 1976. As a result, Republican presidents were able to select the next 10 justices for the court.  So what does this story of conservative success mean for progressives today? Well, as liberals have known since the 1960s, success in the judicial arena does not necessarily translate into victories at the polls. And when forced to defend controversial court decisions, liberals didn\u2019t always convince voters of the rightness of their cause. Too often, at least according to some critics, they went back to the courts in an effort to score victories there, instead of building a grassroots movement to win on Election Day. If the Supreme Court Donald Trump helped construct with the appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh produces decisions that are unpopular \u2013 as some polls suggest \u2013 Democrats might look to the Nixon strategy in hopes of turning the tide both in court and at the ballot box.",

            "article_content": "The midterm elections, a little more than a month away, are a national drama \u2013 with voters deciding whether Republican control of the House and Senate will give way to Democrats, who have been hankering for a chance to challenge the priorities and actions of President Donald Trump. But they are also an intensely local story as voters get ready to make their choices in 435 House and 35 Senate races and in 36 gubernatorial contests. We asked commentators to tell us which race they are watching most closely and why. The views expressed are solely their own. The crowds and the media love him. But will Texas voters turn out for Beto O\u2019Rourke?  In November, the faceoff to watch will be between Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and his Democratic challenger Beto O\u2019Rourke. This contest could upend the political order in the Lone Star State. And an August NBC News poll showed O\u2019Rourke within 4 points of Cruz. This race is fascinating because it is the Democrats\u2019 best chance in years to turn Texas blue. Democrats have long looked to the state\u2019s changing demographics \u2013 Texas is about 40% Hispanic -- with hopes of putting the state into play. However, Texas\u2019 electorate is not the same as its demographics. In 2016, despite a slight increase from prior elections, less than half of the state\u2019s eligible Latino voters turned out at the polls. Ironically, this race is between one of the country\u2019s most prominent Hispanic politicians (Cruz), who supports Trump\u2019s wall and admittedly doesn\u2019t speak Spanish well, and a white upstart (O\u2019Rourke) who is against the wall and fluent en Espa\u00f1ol. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rise is remarkable considering that he is running as a staunch liberal. He supports gun control, the legalization of marijuana and universal health care coverage. What began as a grassroots effort has now garnered such momentum that even Cruz\u2019s former campaign spokesman thinks  O\u2019Rourke could pull off an upset victory. O\u2019Rourke comes across as authentic and youthful, which is reportedly making Cruz nervous. Still, it will take more than viral videos and friendly appearances on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d to put O\u2019Rourke over the top. He remains David to Cruz\u2019s Goliath. While O\u2019Rourke\u2019s likability factor is huge, his effort will hinge on voter mobilization. To win, he will have to perform strongly with millennials, Latinos and voters in Texas\u2019 more liberal cities. In interviews, O\u2019Rourke has often asserted that Texas is not a red state, it is a nonvoting state. He\u2019s got that right \u2013 and so his success will depend on upending this paradigm.

With the House expected to fall to Democrats and Republicans expected to keep and possibly even make gains in the Senate, sweeping 2020 projections will be tricky to make after these midterms. But I\u2019m watching the Senate race in Arizona with a few things in mind. First, putting aside the historic promise of Arizona electing its first woman to the Senate, it\u2019s possible Arizona is about to elect its first Democrat since 1988. President Donald Trump only won Arizona in 2016 by a little over 3 percentage points \u2013 if Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema pulls out a win over Republican Rep. Martha McSally, it will be hard not to see the significance of a reliably red state voting blue. Second, if that happens, exit polling will be key. Was Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and child separation policy a factor? That, specifically, will have national implications and might serve as a forecast of his 2020 re-election hurdles among Hispanic voters. Finally, if McSally, an Air Force veteran, wins, the significance won\u2019t be that a Republican kept the seat red. It will be the kind of Republican who did it. McSally easily beat out Trumpian Kelli Ward in a race that was supposed to send a message to perceived \u201cmoderates\u201d like McSally, the outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake and even the late Sen. John McCain that their kind has fallen out of favor among conservatives. McSally\u2019s win here will prove there\u2019s at least some desire for less \u201cTrumpy\u201d Republicans, even in a historical red state. SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and host of \u201cSE Cupp Unfiltered.\u201d The electoral race that most encapsulates the potential of this political moment and the future of politics in our nation is Lucy McBath\u2019s contest to unseat Republican incumbent Karen Handel in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, just north of Atlanta. Unlike Handel, the former secretary of state of Georgia, who has taken strong stances against Obamacare and regulations, McBath is not a career politician interested in dismantling Washington legislation. She\u2019s not even a lifelong activist. She was, by her own account, just a regular \u201csuburban mom\u201d until her son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed outside a gas station in Florida in 2012 in a dispute over playing loud music. Davis is black, and the white man who killed him had a conceal carry permit. In that horrific moment, McBath became, as she told me over the phone recently, \u201ca mother on a mission.\u201d Speaking out about her son\u2019s death and the need for comprehensive solutions to gun violence and systemic racism, McBath joined \u201cMothers of the Movement,\u201d women whose black children have been killed by gun violence or the police. McBath also became a national spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. \u201cThen Parkland happened,\u201d McBath explained to me. \u201cThose children were the same age as Jordan when he was murdered.\u201d She thought maybe now, finally, policies would change. But when they didn\u2019t, McBath took the next big step \u2013 and declared her candidacy for office. McBath represents the moment we are in as a country today \u2013 where more and more people are not only protesting and lobbying against status quo injustices but also transforming their anger into real political power.  \u201cThis is our modern day civil rights movement,\u201d says McBath. Yet while progressive movements for change haven\u2019t always embraced electoral politics or have been slow to do so, the recent surge of multi-issue, multiracial progressive protest has quickly focused the movement on political change. Mitt Romney won GA-06 in 2012 by 23 points. But Trump just barely won the district in 2016 by one point. And when Handel won the special election a year ago over Democrat Jon Ossoff, the race was still quite close. So, McBath has a real shot at victory. But either way, she\u2019s blazing the trail for ordinary people to become engaged in the political process, including running for office. \u201cI intend to win,\u201d says McBath, \u201cbut no matter what happens, this is a win-win.\u201d Sally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book, \u201cThe Opposite of Hate.\u201d This race in Kentucky\u2019s Bluegrass region features a well-funded incumbent, Republican Andy Barr, running against an outsider Democrat, Amy McGrath, who easily beat two establishment politicians in her primary. Polls close at 6 p.m. ET and votes are counted quickly in Fayette County (Lexington), the district\u2019s largest, which means we\u2019ll know early whether Barr weathered the storm A Democrat win likely means a big night for their party. The Cook Report rates the district R+9 and Trump won here by more than 15 points. If Democrats are knocking down contested jump shots like this, it means the \u201cblue wave\u201d is real. McGrath, a former fighter pilot, leans on her military credentials to fend off the usual attacks that sink Democrats in Kentucky. Shortly after the May primary, internal polling from both parties showed her with a decent lead. But Barr\u2019s campaign smartly went on offense in August, dropping brutal attack ads featuring audio of McGrath claiming: \u201cI am further left, I am more progressive, than anyone in the state of Kentucky,\u201d a bold statement given Kentucky\u2019s only Democratic congressman, John Yarmuth, is one of the most liberal in Congress. McGrath has been taped at numerous fundraisers staking out liberal positions on abortion and taxes, stances better left to campaigns in California than Kentucky. Republicans believe their barrage will have conservative Democrats reaching for the ejection handle on McGrath\u2019s bid. Both parties are all in, with donations and outside spending piling up. Can an anti-Trump, liberal Democrat win in rural Kentucky? You\u2019ll know before dessert on election night. Scott Jennings, a CNN contributor, is a former special assistant to President George W.

Keep a close eye on Tennessee, where Republican Marsha Blackburn is facing off against Democrat Phil Bredesen, a former governor. This race will be a good lens through which to see what kind of damage, if any, President Donald Trump might be inflicting on the GOP. The state is now in comfortable Republican territory. The GOP has a supermajority in the state House, controls seven congressional seats and now holds onto both Senate seats. However, a majority of the nation does not approve of how Trump is doing his job, with his approval rate hovering in high 30s and low 40s. So, how will Trump\u2019s tenure impact this partisan dynamic? The Tennessee Senate race to replace Bob Corker pits the popular two-term governor against a Trumpian Republican who elicits the strong support of anti-abortion activists. While Bredesen promises to expand health care access and opposes the Republican tax cuts, Blackburn has been a harsh critic of the Affordable Care Act and voted in favor of recent tax cuts. And though Bredesen is an unusually popular Democrat and leading in the latest CNN poll, his victory would signal a big chip in the partisan armor of the GOP, which would inevitably be blamed on Trump\u2019s impact on his own party. While one part of the story in November will revolve around who wins control of Congress, another big issue that political observers are watching is whether Trump, with his unstable behavior and radical approach to governance, will stimulate any sort of backlash within his own party that goes beyond words of reprimand. It would take major midterm losses, including defeats that cut deep into Republican territory, to push congressional Republicans into actually taking a stand against the President and beginning a soul-searching process. If this Tennessee Senate seat goes blue, that would be the kind of outcome that could have a real-world impact on Capitol Hill.

There are so many remarkable women and men running for office this year \u2013 Rashida Tlaib, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 but, out of all of them, West Virginia\u2019s Richard Ojeda might be the one most worth watching. Ojeda voted for Donald Trump in 2016, and now he\u2019s the Democratic candidate for his state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. Trump, not surprisingly, is not his biggest fan \u2013 calling him a \u201ctotal whacko\u201d at a recent rally in West Virginia. It\u2019s a wide-open race: Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins vacated his seat, leaving Ojeda to compete against state Rep. Carol Miller. In a district that went for Trump by 50 points, Ojeda is polling at 40% to Miller\u2019s 48%. And 12% are undecided. If you\u2019re wondering why he\u2019s got a shot, just give him a listen. Ojeda is an emboldened, outraged veteran, who came back from battle to find his home embattled. While many Americans risked their lives in nations abroad, many more struggled in our own nation \u2013 persistent income inequality, a disappearing middle class \u2013 and even died, as a pernicious opioid epidemic, for years, went ignored. Yet his opponent doesn\u2019t seem to prioritize these issues. Instead, Miller makes it clear she endorses Trump \u2013 and that the President endorsed her. She appears concerned with defending the Second Amendment, cutting taxes and lining up behind the agenda of the commander-in-chief who Ojeda regrets voting for. Meanwhile, Ojeda speaks the story of struggling Americans in a dialect that dyes progressive populism with the hues of a very red state. This explains why, in addition to his support for more affordable education, comprehensive immigration reform and the decriminalization of medical marijuana, he vocally supports West Virginia\u2019s coal industry, even as he acknowledges the reality of climate change and strives to keep his state competitive through investment in clean and alternative energy sources. Such politics explodes the myth of insurmountable and immutable partisanship. Good for America. But helpful to me, too, as I find myself increasingly unable to singularly identify as a progressive or a conservative. Ojeda suggests that we don\u2019t have to be only and forever Democrats and Republicans, that we can grow and mature. And we don\u2019t have to be milquetoast centrists. We could refuse the political boundaries imposed on us, for what are boundaries but limits, and who are Americans except people who refuse to believe anything is impossible?

Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams are deadlocked. The latest Real Clear Politics polls shows Kemp at 45% versus Abrams at 45%. In other words, Republicans in this center-right red state realize they are in a real fight. It\u2019s not hard to see the headwinds on the national level are blowing through the Peach State. The proverbial soccer moms of suburban Atlanta are conflicted with the tone and tenor of President Donald Trump. But there is time for a course correction before Election Day. After all, the two candidates could not be more different. Secretary of State Kemp is campaigning on \u201cPutting Georgians First\u201d with a focus on jobs, public safety and education. Former State House Minority Leader Abrams \u2013 who could be the first female black governor in the country \u2013 has fully embraced the progressive agenda. Kemp seeks to expand gun rights, while Abrams supports gun-control measures. Kemp wants quality, affordable private health care for all, while Abrams wants to expand Medicaid. Kemp support anti-abortion measures, while Abrams wants to protect abortion rights. Though Abrams is charismatic, as a native of Atlanta myself, I can say her positions are too extreme for the state. Georgia remains a center-right state. Kemp is a center-right candidate, running a center-right campaign. As long as he continues to focus on what\u2019s going right with the economy, Georgians will come home to the GOP.

Those who aren\u2019t on board with President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda but just can\u2019t bring themselves to support the Democrats have a sliver of hope in New Mexico, where former Gov. Gary Johnson, a libertarian, has entered a three-way race for a US Senate seat. As the Libertarian Party\u2019s candidate for president in the 2016 election, Johnson earned 3% of the vote,  the best finish for a national third-party candidate in 20 years. Still, the outcome was something of a disappointment for Johnson, who had hoped to capitalize on historic levels of dissatisfaction with the two main party candidates, but instead became a punchline after a series of gaffes. (Remember, \u201cwhat is Aleppo?\u201d) Afterward, he swore he was done with politics. But now Johnson is mounting an unlikely but far from impossible challenge to incumbent Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich. A former Republican governor of the typically blue state, Johnson is still popular in New Mexico: A recent poll showed Heinrich leading the race at 39%, with 21% for Johnson and 11% for Republican Mike Rich. Some 30% are still undecided. Johnson is an economic conservative known for vetoing hundreds of bills during his first term in office. But he\u2019s also a social liberal who supports abortion rights, immigration and drug legalization. And he\u2019s no fan of the President; in fact, he said Trump\u2019s election \u201ccould be the end of the republic as we know it.\u201d A good showing for Johnson would be a win for the Libertarian Party, while also proving that centrist liberals, independents and Never Trump Republicans can find a compromise candidate.

Three features of the race that pits Republican incumbent Will Hurd against Democratic newcomer Gina Ortiz Jones make it especially important. First, it\u2019s one of the 23 House districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016, but that sent a Republican to Congress. Both parties are laser-focused because it\u2019s prime real estate to flip. If the Democrats don\u2019t win this district, it\u2019s hard to imagine a path to majority control in the House of Representatives. Second, Gina Ortiz Jones has the candidate profile that seems to be motivating Democratic turnout across the county. She\u2019s young. She\u2019s gay. She\u2019s a woman of color. She\u2019s an Iraq War veteran. And she\u2019s progressive. If Jones can\u2019t turn out the vote, then that bodes poorly for Democratic candidates with less compelling personal stories. Third, Hurd isn\u2019t a Donald Trump acolyte. He differs from the President on DACA and the border wall (not surprising given that the district is 55% Hispanic). And as a former CIA official, he has condemned the administration for how it handled Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Hurd poses a challenge for Jones in a way that not all Republicans in similar swing districts do. In short, if TX-23 goes blue, then it\u2019s likely that the wave is nothing short of a tsunami. Jennifer L. Lawless is the Commonwealth Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia. I have known Ben Jealous, the Democratic candidate for Maryland governor, for 2\u00bd decades. What strikes me most about him: Every week, month and year that I have known him, he has been passionately working to help people who needed a strong champion. He is known as the youngest ever president of the NAACP, a venerable, ailing civil rights organization that he fixed and turned around. But he has not helped only African-Americans. Though Jealous is running against Republican candidate Larry Hogan, who has tried to distance himself from Trump, Jealous\u2019 campaign, like many this November, is about President Donald Trump. And Jealous is everything that Trump is not. Where Trump seeks to divide and cater to a narrow base, Jealous has spent his life building diverse coalitions for change in the public and private sector, winning major victories for DREAMers, the LGBTQ community and abolishing Maryland\u2019s death penalty. In the private sector, he is an investor who has helped over 20 socially conscious companies launch and grow, creating jobs and proving that you don\u2019t have to sell your soul to do well in business. He connects as easily with blue-collar white guys as he does with black female churchgoers. Electing a civil rights leader and businessman right on Trump\u2019s doorstep would send a huge signal that voters across the country are turning out to resist bigotry, division and corrupt government. You don\u2019t have to guess what Jealous would do in office. He has been winning real victories for underdogs in every role he has ever played.

One of the races I will be watching on election night is the Houston seat \u2013 the Texas 7th \u2013 currently held by Republican John Culberson. There was a nasty Democratic primary fight that the national party actively engaged in with a ham-handed release of opposition research on the progressive candidate Laura Moser. Ultimately, they got what they wanted in Lizzie Fletcher, a more moderate nominee who Democratic leadership believes will have a better chance of knocking off a longtime incumbent. And Fletcher is still a young, fresh female candidate with a great resume and strong ties to the district. The first test will be whether Democrats coalesce around her candidacy to support her on Election Day like they have in other elections when the more progressive candidate was defeated, such as Virginia\u2019s governor race last year. Culberson has been in office for almost two decades, and he has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act repeatedly, an issue that has become the No. 1 topic for Democrats running this fall. If that message works in the Texas suburbs, it will be a good sign of its effectiveness in other swing districts. Finally, the race also has the potential to benefit from the huge enthusiasm Democratic Senate nominee Beto O\u2019Rourke is generating at the top of the ticket.  Even if he falls short of knocking off sitting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, his impact on the turnout could send Fletcher, as well as a handful of other new Democratic members from the deep red state of Texas, to Congress.

It has been 24 long years since Florida voters elected a Democratic governor. But all signs point to a possible history-making victory by the party\u2019s nominee, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum. The race offers an early test of whether swing states like Florida support President Donald Trump\u2019s performance. Gillum, a progressive, favors single-payer health care and has called for an increase in corporate taxes and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. His Republican rival, Ron DeSantis, is a fervent Trump supporter, riding an endorsement by the President to victory in the Republican primary. While Trump\u2019s backing was enough to win over GOP voters, the November general election is another matter. Trump carried Florida in 2016 by only 113,000 votes, a margin of 1.2% of the more than 9 million votes cast. That means the state is up for grabs this year, giving Democrats a chance to end their exile from the statehouse. Florida is a true swing state, a fact etched in the nation\u2019s memory in 2000, when a razor-thin 537-vote margin delivered the state, and the presidency, to Republican George W. Bush. Since that infamous squeaker, the state has seesawed in presidential races, supporting Bush again in 2004, then switching to Democratic candidate Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 before flipping back to the GOP by supporting Donald Trump in 2016. Democrats know that winning the state this year would give the party a head start on trying to carry the state in the 2020 presidential election.

The last time Republicans won a Senate race in New Jersey, Richard Nixon was president. Over the last 46 years, Republicans have found spectacular ways to lose New Jersey Senate races, even when the GOP found success in wave election years nationally. They even lost when Ronald Reagan won a landslide re-election victory in 1984. Although New Jersey has been a traditional Democratic stronghold, with Democrats outnumbering Republicans by nearly 900,000, voters have elected Republican governors over the years. Yet the Senate has eluded the GOP since 1972. Opposite the national trend of Democrats running competitively in Republican leaning districts across the country, the New Jersey Senate race may actually be in play in a reliably blue state.  GOP Senate candidate Bob Hugin, a wealthy former pharmaceutical executive and former Marine, has spent nearly $16 million of his own money attacking incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez as corrupt after his federal corruption trial ended in a mistrial and his severe admonishment by the Senate Ethics Committee. The attacks seem to be working. According to the latest Stockton University poll, Menendez\u2019s once double digit lead is down to 2 points, 45% to 43%. While other Republican candidates across the country pledge their loyalty to President Donald Trump, Hugin is taking another approach by declaring himself a \u201cdifferent kind of Republican.\u201d He\u2019s pro-abortion rights, against tariffs and critical of the GOP tax plan that hurt many of the state\u2019s property owners because of the cap on state and local tax deductions. All these positions are at odds with the President, who unsurprisingly, has a low approval rating within the state. New Jersey\u2019s Senate race is probably too close for comfort for Democrats, who already have to defend 26 Senate seats, 10 in states Trump won in 2016.  With a slim 51-49 GOP margin of control, every Senate race counts in 2018 \u2013 even in New Jersey.

Every race is critical: Here in California, where I live now, there are seven key House seats in districts that went blue in November 2016, and any path for Democrats to flip Congress will run through those. But the race I\u2019m tracking most closely is actually in New York, my home state, albeit in the suburban reaches of upstate surrounding Albany: The dead-heat contest between vulnerable Republican incumbent Rep. John Faso and his Democratic challenger, Antonio Delgado. Delgado is an incredibly impressive candidate \u2013 a Harvard-educated lawyer and Rhodes scholar who is running as a moderate progressive. He\u2019s also black, running in a district that\u2019s 84% white. Faso, in contrast, is a Trump-down-the-line checkbox in the House; until recently, he\u2019s been best known for voting to kill Obamacare despite vowing to a cancer-patient constituent that he would not compromise her insurance in a video that subsequently went viral. But Faso has a new infamy attached to his name: Pressured by polls showing that Delgado was tied or even ahead in the race, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a disgusting, deeply coded campaign ad that uses clips from Delgado\u2019s youthful flirtation with hip-hop (rapping under the handle \u201cAD the Voice\u201d) as evidence that Faso\u2019s challenger was out of step with the values of the district and \u201cunfit\u201d to serve as their representative. The race-baiting led The New York Times to run an editorial condemning Faso. Other publications have followed suit. With any luck, Faso\u2019s racist Hail Mary won\u2019t throw him a lifeline, but an anvil. Given the demographics of the district and the nature of the race, if Delgado wins, it will be part of an overwhelming blue sweep of the midterm elections. Jeff Yang is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, a featured writer for Quartz and other publications, and the co-host of the podcast \u201cThey Call Us Bruce.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this article attributed the ad about Antonio Delgado to John Faso's campaign. However, the National Republican Congressional Committee is responsible for it. It also referred to the race as the New York Ninth, but it is the New York Nineteenth. This article has also been corrected to give Gina Ortiz Jones' full name.",

It provoked a reckoning over gender and power and over partisan politics that commentators took on in a series of opinion pieces for CNN.  The opinions expressed in these commentaries are theirs. Here\u2019s a look at what they said: President Trump, Sens. Grassley and Graham, and the rest of their party may never get it, and  Kavanaugh may still be confirmed. But make no mistake, the rules have changed. As millions of American women share their #Metoo moments, it becomes harder to argue this \u201cboys will be boys\u201d nonsense. It gets harder to question 30-year-old memories. It gets harder to ignore women like Christine Blasey Ford.

She is president of Solis Strategies, a Washington-based consulting firm that specializes in serving nonprofits, NGO\u2019s and corporations. Let\u2019s be honest about this FBI request: It has little to do with the truth and everything to do with the Democrats\u2019 end game to keep this Supreme Court seat open through the midterm election. Democrats hope to take control of the Senate and hold this seat vacant through 2020, the way the GOP stalled Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016. They want revenge for Merrick Garland, an understandable if misguided emotion. Democrats couldn\u2019t care less about Ford or her story because they are consumed with politics. And the Democratic Party\u2019s lionizing of people like Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy, all tied to their own scandal, tells us all we need to know about whether they believe in treating victims with respect.

It is directed especially, she writes, to \u201cmen who are white, nondisabled, and otherwise privileged \u2018golden boys.\u2019\u201d Himpathy leads everyone to see powerful men as important, worthwhile, and sympathetic, and to treat women with suspicion and doubt. That\u2019s why Republican Susan Collins, in Democratic-leaning Maine, has been the focus of Democratic anger and misogynist abuse for potentially supporting Kavanaugh, while Republican Cory Gardner in Democratic-leaning Colorado, has been almost completely ignored. In a misogynist culture, even women may find it easier in some cases to see the perspective of men. And as for men, they are encouraged to identify with the manliness of powerful men more thoroughly than they identify with their own masculinity, or than they identify with themselves.

We viscerally know what \u201cRenate Alumnius\u201d means because we are collectively fluent, after long experience, in the subtle language of misogyny. And we also know how it feels to have our fluency in that language denied. When women identify disrespect or demand better treatment, we are often the ones who are punished, or told that our version of events doesn\u2019t reflect reality. The denials from Kavanaugh\u2019s lawyers are practically Trumpian: Yes, it says what it says and we all know what that means, but you can\u2019t believe your lyin\u2019 eyes.

Accusers do not tend to fare well in word-on-word clashes. As I have described, skepticism of sexual violence complaints has shape-shifted over time. Yet it remains firmly lodged. The staying power of credibility discounting is a notable feature \u2014 perhaps even the dominant feature \u2014 of our response to rape. This may be changing. The #MeToo movement is challenging a societal default to doubt, and the past year has brought undeniable progress. Yet even as sexual misconduct complaints are met with newfound receptivity, it is worth noting that lone accusers continue to bear a special burden. (It seems unlikely that Senate Republicans will ask the FBI to investigate two other accusers\u2019 reports against Kavanaugh, or even that they will be asked to testify before the Judiciary Committee.) Many survivors of sexual violence are deterred by the likelihood of a swearing contest. But Ford \u2014 in the face of death threats \u2014 has agreed to appear before the committee. She walks into a \u201che said, she said\u201d showdown that could well have been avoided, one in which the deck has already been stacked against her.

No matter how Thursday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing plays out, there will be no winners. Not Brett Kavanaugh, who will always bear the stain of being accused of sexual assault, even if he is ultimately seated on the high court.  Not Republicans, who are poised to \u201cplow right through\u201d to his confirmation no matter what (and will likely face consequences for it in November), nor Democrats, who have been so far largely powerless to derail this charade. And certainly not the American people, who are witnessing a disregard for due process, for the voices of survivors of sexual assault, and for the integrity of the Supreme Court itself. The through-line of Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination has been a lack of respect for basic judicial norms.  Before issues arose about Kavanaugh\u2019s conduct as a young man, there were still major unanswered questions about his finances, his truthfulness under oath, and his tenure in the White House. None of this has seemed to matter to Republicans, who have so rushed this process that it has devolved into a melodramatic circus, rather than a thoughtful consideration of a nominee\u2019s fitness for a lifetime appointment.  No wonder polls show that Kavanaugh is deeply unpopular; his nomination has been politicized beyond repair.  That represents a disservice to Kavanaugh, his accusers, the court, and the public. Our lawmakers have a constitutional obligation to thoroughly and fairly evaluate a potential Supreme Court justice. Yet in their lust for power, the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee members are abdicating this responsibility \u2013 and we are all the worse for it. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes. But weaponizing #MeToo to take down a political appointee, throwing due process out the window, deciding before anyone has been able to testify publicly that one person is credible and the other isn\u2019t, and setting dangerous standards most victims will never be able to clear isn\u2019t a good way to protect our country from the court. It\u2019s just a good way to dilute democracy, diminish the important strides #MeToo has made and imperil every future victim of sexual assault.

Kavanaugh and his handlers undoubtedly formulated a strategy to feature his wife alongside him in their joint interview.

Kavanaugh stands poised to be the justice who will cement an anti-abortion rights court. With images of him with his wife, daughters, law clerks, and young female basketball players, he is framed as a man who supports women and their futures. (Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations.) They were front and center in the hearings \u2013 a visual counterargument to the idea that women\u2019s lives and bodies are not safe in his hands. Now that some women have accused him of assaulting them, the images are even more important. The happy, shining faces of these teenage girls are meant to inspire trust.

While I do not remember the events or actions alleged by Dr. Ford, I deeply apologize for any actions I took that caused her to feel harmed, abused or unsafe in any way. Few things are more terrifying than to feel that one\u2019s personal safety is at risk, and I take Dr. Ford at her word that I caused those feelings in her. That was never my intention, and I am greatly distressed to learn that she has carried these feelings for many years.

As a Republican who voted for the President in large part due to his commitment to Antonin Scalia-like justices, I\u2019m encouraged to hear Kavanaugh say he will not withdraw his name from consideration over the allegations, adding that he\u2019s \u201cnot going anywhere.\u201d In other words: Attempts \u201cto Bork\u201d Kavanaugh will not go without a counterpunch. The #MeToo movement has been instrumental in shining light on the darkness of sexual abuse. Let me be abundantly clear, I mean for all involved \u2013 the accusers and the accused. As my friend and colleague Don Lemon (who is a victim of sexual assault) says: It doesn\u2019t matter if the accused is \u201c17 or 70,\u201d it\u2019s wrong. Sexual abuse is wrong.

It\u2019s important to emphasize the way many have characterized the alleged behavior as a so-called youthful indiscretion. Others, even if they are not using Kavanaugh\u2019s youth as an excuse, ask questions or make claims suggesting that something he allegedly did as a minor should not disqualify him from serving on the court.  Contrast that characterization with how black and brown teenagers \u2013 Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, the \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d \u2013 have been described in more adult (and thereby more threatening) terms. At the same time, thousands of young men (disproportionately people of color) have been convicted of sexual assault for conduct similar to or lesser than what is alleged against Kavanaugh \u2013 conduct that in some cases also occurred when they were teenagers. Nonetheless, they were arrested, prosecuted, convicted and jailed with sentences in double digits of years, not months. Prosecutors did not decline these cases because the perpetrators were teenagers at the time.   Read more\u2026 Shira A.

If Ford is lying, it\u2019s the most monstrous lie imaginable. If she\u2019s telling the truth, what Kavanaugh did was horrendous, and he clearly has no place in the judiciary at all. For conservatives, however, the truth \u2013 which, to repeat, may remain frustratingly ambiguous \u2013 is only one part of the political calculation. The challenge they face is this: If they drop Kavanaugh, then they fear it will send a message that a career can be stopped by an unproved allegation, and that\u2019s not a precedent they care to set. But if they stand by Kavanaugh and he makes it to the Supreme Court, they could be stuck with a man on the bench haunted by the accusation of sexual assault. And given that Kavanaugh is socially conservative \u2013 possibly even the much-dreamed-of deciding vote to overturn Roe v. Wade \u2013 his appointment is both everything the right has ever wanted and, suddenly, something to be cautious about.

Despite the potential for high drama and even disaster,  Ford\u2019s offer to testify before the Judiciary Committee was one Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans could not refuse while still hoping to confirm Kavanaugh. The stakes of such a hearing for Kavanaugh, who will also testify, are obvious. The political hazards for Republicans were made clear Monday when an off-script Sen. Orrin Hatch, a very senior member of the judiciary committee that will quiz Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser, suggested that  Ford may be \u201cmixed up\u201d about a recollection she says has haunted her for 36 years. Kavanaugh\u2019s supporters on the committee will want to vigorously defend him.

Ford\u2019s testimony could stand as a harrowing indictment of Kavanaugh\u2019s abject unfitness to sit on the Supreme Court. After all, her allegation is not one of a merely inappropriate comment, but of sexual assault. If true, in a just world, the price for allegedly holding a girl down, attempting to remove her clothes, turning up music so no one can hear her protests, and muffling her screams until she manages to escape, should be quite high. Furthermore, if Republican senators attempt to impugn her character, they will disgrace themselves in the eyes of the American people.

The midterm season kicks off Tuesday when the Senate begins hearings on Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Although the hearings appear disconnected from the action on the campaign trail, they will become a pivotal moment for each party to highlight for voters what is at stake in November. Democrats' clown show of outrage over Kavanaugh fools no one President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kavanaugh brought many cheers from conservatives. Kavanaugh is one of the legal minds who comes from the movement that centers around the Federalist Society, which conservatives built in the 1980s in an effort to transform the courts. Faced with what they perceived to be the liberal dominance of law schools and justices, conservatives nurtured thick networks of intellectuals, justices, and lawyers who mentored talented conservative minds so that there would be deep bench from which presidents could make their appointments. Unlike Robert Bork, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s failed Supreme Court nominee in 1987, Kavanaugh is more polished and less polemical, which will make it much more difficult for Democrats to paint him as a right-wing zealot. Given Republican control of the Senate and the absence of a filibuster, the odds of Democrats sidetracking the nomination are virtually nil. Although some on the right have grumbled that he was too Washington establishment for their taste, the National Review praised this \u201cwhip-smart legal conservative\u201d while former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson praised him as a \u201cman of character, decency, and intellectual depth.\u201d A majority of Republican governors signed a letter endorsing him. Kavanaugh has even received praise from several liberals who have urged their party to move forward with the confirmation. Lisa Blatt, a self-described \u201cliberal feminist lawyer,\u201d wrote in Politico that \u201cSometimes a superstar is just a superstar. That is the case with Judge Brett Kavanaugh \u2026 The Senate should confirm him.\u201d Every Supreme Court justice's vote should surprise you In the  The New York Times, the distinguished Yale Law School professor Akhil Amar wrote that \u201cit is hard to name anyone with judicial credentials as strong as those of Judge Kavanaugh,\u201d who was once his student, and told readers that he \u201ccommands wide and deep respect among scholars, lawyers, and jurists.\u201d Although without the filibuster most Democrats understand that they are fighting a losing battle to stop the nomination, they can use the hearings as a forum to remind voters exactly what is at stake in the midterm elections. There are few issues that have provided as clear-cut evidence of what the long-term implications are of united Republican government than the courts. Putting aside the Supreme Court, President Trump and the Senate Republicans have been remarkably effective at moving forward their picks in recent months, setting in motion a massive transformation of the judiciary. At the Supreme Court level, the appointment of Neil Gorsuch was an early and massive victory for Republicans. This pick will shift the Court decisively to the right, with possibly more vacancies to come. \u201cHe has a very nice smile, but an inch below the surface, he is a hard-right warrior,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. As Democrats are seeking to bolster turnout in November, especially in the Senate races where the odds still favor the Republicans, the hearings will be an exceptional opportunity to lay out the kinds of policies that hang in the balance if Democrats don\u2019t regain control of Congress and Republicans keep moving forward with their appointments. In Trump's court pick, who won? Several potential Democratic presidential candidates, including Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Amy Klobuchar, sit on the Judiciary Committee, and will have a chance to burnish their credentials with Democrats. By asking questions about executive power, abortion rights, affirmative action, money in politics, environmental regulation, the legitimacy of unions and more, they can create a roadmap for why voting Democratic in the Senate races is so vital if one cares about these issues. Republicans understand that the hearings present a similar opportunity for them. Although they will have to be careful since they don\u2019t want to push Kavanaugh into making specific statements he would rather avoid and they don\u2019t want to further motivate Democrats into a bigger fight, they do want Republican voters to remember why they need to come out for their party even if they don\u2019t like Trump\u2019s style very much. If there are concerns among Republicans about the long-term implications of the President for their party, the courts are one area that dispel those fears. In The New York Times, Thomas Kaplan reported that the administration was \u201cleaving an ever-expanding imprint on the judiciary,\u201d as Republicans had undertaken a \u201cdetermined effort to nominate and confirm a steady procession of young conservative jurists.\u201d The recent confirmation of Georgia Supreme Court Justice Britt Grant to the appeals court made Trump the president with the highest number of circuit court appointments at this juncture in the presidency since the system was created in 1981. If Republicans are seeking ways to energize their base for the brutal slog of the next few months this is it and they will now have a televised platform to remind their voters of this promise. Even without saying much, simply by handling the hearings well and controlling the Democratic attacks, the GOP will walk away happy that they are handing their supporters the most important item on their political wish list.  While it would be wonderful if Supreme Court confirmation hearings could be insulated from the political process, that will simply not happen in the near future. The reality is that the confirmation process has become deeply political and deeply partisan. Successful nominees have learned how to survive through the polarization rather than pretend that it will go away. The Kavanaugh hearings are no different and, since they are taking place at the start of September, they will become the opening bell for a midterm election that will be as important to the country\u2019s future as any we have experienced in recent history.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Now familiar as a smiling, nodding presence at the President\u2019s side, Mike Pence was little known outside of his home state of Indiana when Donald Trump selected him as his running mate in 2016. A bit more than two years later, as he crisscrosses America to campaign for Republicans in the midterm elections, Pence is setting himself up to replace his boss if Trump leaves office early or does not seek re-election. \u201cMike will be ready\u201d is the line Pence\u2019s aides and allies use as they contemplate his place in a post-Trump world. Pence would never admit this. He plays the part of unctuous toady so fully that the conservative writer George Will called him \u201cAmerica\u2019s most repulsive public figure.\u201d But don\u2019t be fooled. The vice president is doggedly pursuing his own ambitions on the side. The Oval Office has been his goal since high school. He has seeded the federal government with his loyalists and is building his own nationwide political organization. He is acting, in fact, as if he is on a mission from God. Some may laugh, but many conservative Christians believe that God is merely using Trump to prepare the way for a so-called true man of faith. Pence\u2019s rise to power would affirm the \u201cCyrus prophecy,\u201d which became a popular notion among Christian right circles when Pence joined the 2016 ticket. Cyrus was a Persian king whom the Old Testament credits with returning the Jews to Jerusalem. He was a pagan who nevertheless served God. Right-wing evangelists such as Lance Wallnau cited that tale in 2016 when they declared that Trump \u2013  a profane and sinful man \u2013 could nevertheless do God\u2019s work and was thus worthy of conservative Christian votes. An estimated 80% of white evangelicals gave Trump their votes. The story of Cyrus resonates with many right-wing Christians because they imagine themselves to be persecuted like the Jews of old. Despite their vast wealth, power and numbers, these believers cite developments such as same-sex marriage and the use of ecumenical phrases such as \u201chappy holidays,\u201d instead of Merry Christmas, as evidence they are a minority under siege. They imagine themselves to be victims of a culture war and feel that something must be done to defend an old order that they once dominated. Mike Pence's political life and career As a radio host, member of Congress and then governor of Indiana, Pence made himself the most successful conservative Christian politician of his generation. Indeed he says he is \u201ca Christian, a conservative and a Republican in that order.\u201d During 12 years in Congress he never authored a single bill, but he did become a prominent advocate for banning abortion, defunding Planned Parenthood and restricting marriage only to heterosexual couples. In his one term as governor he overstepped when he signed a bill \u2013 the so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act \u2013 permitting discrimination against gay people, and was forced to seek a change in the law. His rhetoric attacking abortion rights, adultery and even evolution (he says he doesn\u2019t believe in it) assured the Christian right that he was one of them. Mike Pence went to college and found God When Trump offered Pence his spot on the ticket, the Republican Party\u2019s evangelical wing was over the moon.  Pence was also a first-term governor facing a tough battle for re-election despite a longstanding and substantial GOP advantage in voter registration. His outspoken support for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act had alienated some centrist Republicans and, though Pence was genial enough, he was not the kind of campaigner who got folks fired up. Offered a path out of struggling obscurity in Indiana, Pence didn\u2019t need a Bible prophecy to tell him it was OK to take the leap. He hitched his pious ambitions to a crude, twice-divorced, self-confessed sexual predator whose grasp of faith and Scripture appears nonexistent. Pence\u2019s favorite Bible verse reads: \u201cFor I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u201d He cites it when he discusses the opportunities that come his way, and to explain the confidence he brings to politics. VP Pence full National Prayer Breakfast speech Pence\u2019s theology says that God selects in advance which individuals will become believers and rewards their faith regardless of what they do. This belief allows for all sorts of bad behavior, if it can be framed as supporting the ultimate goal of promoting the evangelical agenda. Pence\u2019s loyalty to the President, even after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape exposed Trump as a serial sexual harasser,  baffled many. It was reported at the time that Pence considered trying to replace Trump at the top of the ticket, but in the end he held his place and his tongue. Pence\u2019s religion explains that choice, and his decision to abandon many of his previous positions on the issues, such as his opposition to banning Muslim visitors to America. To understand how a seemingly pious politician such as Pence could join Trump and stick with him requires tracing the long path of his ambition. Pence wasn\u2019t always the rigidly moralistic and confident conservative evangelical he professes to be today.  But he was, from the beginning of his adult life, a man who thought he was destined for the presidency. This article is the first in a series of three by Michael D\u2019Antonio and Peter Eisner, the authors of the new book, \u201cThe Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence.\u201d An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly indicated that President Trump was thrice divorced.

View more opinion articles on CNN. This is the second in a series of three op-eds tracing the long path of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s ambition, from college, where he found a form of evangelicalism that weds theology to Republican politics, to the national stage\u2013 and a job that puts him a short step away from the presidency.  Part one:  Mike Pence\u2019s plan to outlast Trump An outgoing young man, Mike Pence once modeled spring clothes for a local department store and served as an altar boy at the Catholic church his family attended. He excelled in debate contests, was class president at his high school and embraced the Democratic Party, just like his Irish immigrant grandfather. As a college freshman, he was elected to head his fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta.  He also took command of a fellowship group, Vespers, which met in the campus chapel every Tuesday evening. At the frat he turned in his brothers for drinking beer. At the chapel he passed judgment on his peers. People who met Mike Pence at Hanover College say something happened there to change him. In the fall of 1977, when he arrived, Hanover was the kind of liberal arts school where young minds were gently opened by professors and classmates. Pence moved in the opposite direction there, becoming more rigid and doctrinaire as he studied for a history degree. Eventually his faith led him to reject some friends and even regard his fianc\u00e9e, Karen, as a sinner whom he would have to forgive in order to marry.  These habits of mind, later revealed in his hostility to equality for gay people and even climate science, were formed when he was barely an adult. Vespers was organized around songs and testimonies of faith. It offered community to students who were adjusting to the emotional challenge of leaving home. It also gave the guitar-playing Pence the opportunity to preach with the zeal of a new convert to right-wing Christianity.  His schoolmate Linda Koon recalls a charismatic fellow who turned cruel when she failed to meet his definition of true faith. Mike Pence's plan to outlast Trump \u201cHe was rigid, condescending and exclusionary,\u201d Koon said in an interview. \u201cYou had to fit into his little pocket of Christianity, and I didn\u2019t fit.\u201d Koon\u2019s problem was that she couldn\u2019t recount a dramatic come-to-Jesus tale of Christian conversion.  \u201cHe acted like he had been struck by lightning,\u201d she said. \u201cI had just grown up in the Lutheran Church and had always been a Christian. That wasn\u2019t good enough. He told me that wasn\u2019t good enough, \u2018God doesn\u2019t want your kind.\u2019 It was a very narrow view of an infinite being.\u201d The conversion story Pence told then, and many times later, found him at a Christian music festival where he answered a call to approach the stage and declare a commitment to Jesus. Pence, who loved to perform, was moved by the chance to stand at the center of a public ritual. Years later he would say: \u201cMy heart really finally broke, with a deep realization what had happened on the cross, in some infinitesimal way, had happened for me, and I gave my life, and made a personal decision to trust Jesus Christ as my savior.\u201d From then on, Pence moved steadily toward a form of evangelicalism that reserves heaven for a certain type of believer and marries theology to Republican politics.  Pence was coached in his beliefs by a Hanover schoolmate, L. John Gables, who was bound for a career as a preacher. In a recent sermon Gables noted with disapproval that America has entered an \u201cage of tolerance and inclusion\u201d and urged his flock to stand against it, because \u201cthere is no other way\u201d but God\u2019s. Pence unveils plans for 'Space Force' Gables has preached that in his brand of faith Jesus Christ is \u201cthe only assured way of salvation.\u201d He justifies an aggressive form of religious activism as a matter of tough love.  At college, his friend Pence delivered a harsh public verdict on the condition of Linda Koon\u2019s soul in a campfire circle at a Vespers retreat. As she told us in an interview, Pence\u2019s evaluation of her fervor was followed by a recitation of her supposed sins, including her attendance at a wild party at the fraternity where Pence was in charge. Koon says she left the session in tears, and was subsequently shunned by the members of the prayer group.  After a temporary loss of faith, she undertook a new religious journey that led her to a more open-minded perspective.  But the pain of the loss she experienced at Hanover remains.  \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me who is still 18,\u201d says Koon, \u201cand I still feel it.\u201d The pain is more acute for the gay man who lived down the hall from Pence at Hanover and considered him a mentor. Almost 40 years after they met, Pence\u2019s schoolmate asked to speak anonymously as he recalled that Pence was the first person he ever told about his sexual orientation.  \u201cI went to him because I respected him. Mike told me that who I was was an abomination, and that I had to change. He also stopped being my friend.\u201d Remarkably, this Hanover alumnus said, Pence was almost as judgmental about his wife-to-be, Karen, as he was about gay students. \u201cHe told me that he needed to forgive her because she had been married before and wasn\u2019t a virgin. It had taken a while for him to get there, but he had forgiven her.  He couldn\u2019t forgive me in the same way and it was a long time before I came out to anyone else.\u201d Scott Roos went to college with Pence and confirmed that he rejected his gay friend. Roos said he experienced virulent anti-gay prejudice, including slurs and public shaming, when he and his partner acknowledged their relationship to their fraternity brothers. Formerly friendly, Pence stopped speaking to Roos. \u201cThere were other religious people at Hanover, but he was way out there,\u201d Roos said in a telephone interview. Pence praises Trump during evangelical event Roos also said of Pence: \u201cHe said that God told him he would be president.\u201d Accordingly, Pence stayed away from the stag-film parties and beer blasts in his frat house, but when confronted directly by an administrator, turned his brothers in for buying a keg of beer, according to a former fraternity brother, Dan Murphy, who now teaches at Hanover. The school came down hard on everyone, but when Pence later sought a job in the admissions office, he got it. In his own life Pence followed a traditional path. He met his wife, Karen, at church and they were married in 1985.  She left her teaching job when she became a mother. The couple has three children. After Hanover, and his wedding, Pence lost a couple of congressional races, where he campaigned on his opposition to abortion rights and gay rights \u2013 before settling into a career in local talk radio. His first station was a small one owned by an Indiana preacher named Gene Hood, who had brought 200 people to a local ballroom to protest a Miss Gay America contest.  Hood was so worked up that he told the local paper: \u201cIf they try this another time, I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s going to be bloodshed. We mean business. There are some red-blooded men in Indianapolis, and we won\u2019t stand for this.\u201d On Hood\u2019s station and others, Pence presented himself as what he termed \u201cRush Limbaugh on decaf,\u201d delivering his extreme positions with a softer voice. When a female officer was punished by the Air Force for an extramarital affair, he bemoaned the \u201cnormalization\u201d of adultery and declared \u201cthe seventh commandment contained in the Ten Commandments is still a big deal.\u201d He railed against Hollywood immorality, and called Jack Kevorkian, who helped terminally ill people commit suicide, \u201ca monster.\u201d The Pences moved from Catholicism to conservative evangelicalism and committed themselves to shared beliefs about society and politics. When she was still a teacher, Karen Pence wrote a letter to the Indianapolis Star criticizing an article that informed young readers about a hotline where they could ask questions about sexuality. She wrote: \u201cNo wonder our youth are confused. I only pray that most  parents were able to intercept your article before their children were encouraged to call the Gay/Lesbian Youth Hotline which  encourages them to \u2018accept their homosexuality\u2019 instead of encouraging them that they are not.\u201d Pence: Arpaio a champion of rule of law Like Karen and others in their conservative subculture, Mike Pence argued that homosexuality was a medical disorder that could be cured through prayer and therapy. In this period the Pences joined a congregation affiliated with the Evangelical Free Church of America, which condemned homosexuality. In 2003 the church would echo Karen Pence\u2019s words with a statement that decried \u201cthe current state of confusion in our culture regarding sexuality and especially homosexuality.\u201d In the 2004 election campaign, marriage equality became a hot button issue and a number of states approved measures to deny gay people equal rights. Courts would later determine largely that such bans were unconstitutional, but Pence held fast to his position. This issue, along with unwavering opposition to abortion and gun control, as well as loyalty to the pro-business donors who made him a successful fundraiser, represented the religious aspect of his political identity.  It would soon command a national stage.",

He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of eminently qualified, mainstream conservative Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court \u2013 combined with the predictable Democratic outrage machine \u2013 has put red state Democratic US senators in a political box: side with their constituents or with the clown show that is the modern American left. Trump\u2019s prime-time announcement of Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination on Monday was beautifully played by the White House. The name did not leak, leaving liberal picketers to make protest signs for multiple possible nominees. This made clear that protesters couldn\u2019t have cared less about the personnel, just that Donald Trump would be signing the nomination papers. The protesters then ran Shannon Bream of Fox News off the street as she attempted to broadcast in front of the Supreme Court. The liberal group \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d slammed Trump\u2019s nominee in a press release that left the actual name of the nominee with \u201cxx,\u201d an embarrassing prewritten screed that would have gone out no matter who Trump picked. Shortly after the announcement, an editor for The Daily Beast tweeted an article with the message: \u201cForget abortion or same-sex marriage \u2014 contraception could be banned under Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d Within minutes of Trump\u2019s choice, the left-leaning media would have people running to the drugstore to hoard condoms and birth control pills like a Kentuckian stocking up on milk and bread at the first sign of snow flurries. The hysteria was in full bloom mere minutes after Trump\u2019s announcement. Why a court with Kavanaugh is nothing to fear Not to be outdone, liberal actor Ron Perlman tweeted an implication that Kavanaugh would plunge the United States into either \u201cMedieval Values\u201d or \u201cShariah Law.\u201d Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe took it a step further, tweeting that Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination will \u201cthreaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come.\u201d He did not address, however, how Americans who already died from tax cuts, (as one former Obama official threatened they would) or the United States pulling out of the Paris climate accords (a fatal mistake, as envisioned by a Vox writer), or the Obamacare repeal, (McAuliffe, once more) would perish again. I kid, but apparently these Democrats, in all their hyperbole, do not. You expect it from the more liberal corners of Hollywood and the Democratic Party, but NBC News joined the fray when reporters Leigh Ann Caldwell and Geoff Bennett tweeted Tuesday (and then Caldwell later deleted) an outrageous conspiracy theory that retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy and President Trump engaged \u201cfor months\u201d in secret \u201cnegotiations\u201d to rig the process for Kavanaugh, a former Kennedy clerk. In Trump's court pick, who won? Their \u201creporting\u201d then set off a series of alarmist left-wing outrage tweets, which garnered thousands of retweets, as Charles C.W. Cooke of the National Review pointed out, before corrective tweets from Caldwell landed as quietly as a church mouse. The tinfoil hats were out in force, as they have been since Kennedy announced his retirement. It is a near weekly occurrence during the Trump presidency; everyone sees the falsehood while few see the correction. With the resistance in full meltdown, the people who really matter \u2013 US senators \u2013 are now charged with evaluating Kavanaugh and rendering a decision on confirmation. Because Democrats foolishly shattered longstanding Senate traditions by weakening the Senate\u2019s filibuster power for judicial nominations in 2013, and then trying to filibuster Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017, they are left to lie in a bed of irrelevance of their own making. As long as Republicans stick together, they can confirm Kavanaugh with a simple majority vote on the floor. The Democratic senators to watch hail from red states: Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Claire McCaskill of Missouri. All are on the ballot this year, and all represent states Trump won easily in 2016. Their constituents, according to Republicans\u2019 internal polling, want Kavanaugh confirmed even as the left rages and demands resistance to all things \u2013 and nominees \u2013 born of Trump.  These Democrats are in quite a pickle. Three of them voted for Gorsuch in 2017 and Kavanaugh is as (or more) qualified and similarly conservative. Voting against Kavanaugh would signal to the folks back home that their votes are now controlled by the left-wing partisans described above \u2014 not a good look during a re-election campaign in states where Trump remains popular. As long as Republican senators remain united, it is a safe bet Kavanaugh will get a handful of Democratic votes, making his lifetime appointment a bipartisan affair. For the red state Democrats, there\u2019s nothing to be gained from joining the loony left on this quixotic campaign, but there\u2019s much to lose by abandoning the desires of their center-right constituents who very much appreciate the President\u2019s qualified judicial appointments.",

            "article_content": "CNN Opinion asked commentators to weigh in on President Donald Trump\u2019s choice to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the retirement of Anthony Kennedy \u2013 Judge Brett Kavanaugh.  The opinions expressed in these commentaries are those of the authors. For nearly all of the 116 successful appointments to the US Supreme Court, two criteria have been paramount: ideological compatibility with the nominating president and objective merit. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s insistence that he didn\u2019t consider the nominee\u2019s political views, the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, which provided the president with suggested appointees, did.  Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s conservative ideology is compatible with these two interest groups and Trump\u2019s most recent ideological posture. Yet Kavanaugh\u2019s brand of conservatism is more akin to his mentor President George W. Bush\u2019s \u201ccompassionate\u201d variety than the extremism of many \u201cmovement conservatives\u201d in the Goldwater/Reagan mold. As the nominee to replace his judicial role model Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he clerked, Kavanaugh is the perfect candidate to assume the Court\u2019s swing seat under a Republican president. He may be less moderate than Kennedy, but he is not as incendiary as a Robert Bork, whose nomination failed in 1987 at the hands of a Democratic Senate, led by Ted Kennedy.  Supreme Court nomination politics are even more polarized now, but the Senate is in GOP hands, even if only narrowly so, making a Bork debacle much less likely. In addition, Kavanaugh, with his two Yale degrees, and stellar professional pedigree, is unquestionably meritorious and qualified to take his place on the nation\u2019s highest tribunal, joining the long list of luminaries who have graced its bench.  Trump has been caught in many a lie, but he has made good on his campaign promise to name qualified conservatives to the bench. Barbara A. Perry is the Gerald L. Baliles Professor and director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center. She was a Supreme Court fellow in 1994-95. Follow her on Twitter @BarbaraPerryUVA. President Trump has been very clear that his pick for any Supreme Court nominee would be a vote to end Roe v. Wade, criminalize abortion, and thus punish women. Clearly, he must believe Brett Kavanaugh lives up to his litmus test. We can\u2019t forget what America was like before Roe and we know the devastating reality today for so many women in so many states where the right to make the most fundamental decisions about their bodies, families, and lives has been all but eradicated. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh would likely use his position as a tool to doom all women to that fate. Ending Roe doesn\u2019t end abortion \u2013 it simply means we have a country where abortion is illegal and women and doctors become criminals. Yet, according to a 2016 survey, nearly seventy percent of Americans believe abortion should remain legal in this country. With the power to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, Senators now hold the keys to women\u2019s fundamental freedom. They must ensure that the Court is a check against the ideological agenda of this administration and that it\u2019s part of an independent branch of government. This is essential to the human and civil rights our democracy depends on. Ilyse Hogue is President of NARAL Pro-Choice America. Brett Kavanaugh is a great pick, even if an inside-the-Beltway double-Ivy swamp creature is a somewhat surprising choice for Donald Trump. Having spent a dozen years on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit \u2013 the second-highest court in the land \u2013 Kavanaugh has been devoted to textualism and originalism. His opinions are scholarly and influential in the legal profession, often cited by the Supreme Court itself. He\u2019s much like Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he clerked, in his dedication to the Constitution\u2019s structural protections for liberty. He believes that, as he put it at the White House ceremony announcing his nomination, \u201can independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic.\u201d   His steadfast defense of civil rights, including the freedom of speech, and religion, and armed self-defense, are so important in these embattled times. Perhaps most notably, Kavanaugh\u2019s willingness to push back on the excesses of the regulatory state make him a man for the moment. I hope that he joins Justices Gorsuch and Thomas in a project to make judges less deferential to administrative agencies. More prosaically, Kavanaugh can differentiate between the hats he has worn as a judge, teacher, scholar, and political operator. He sees the judicial role as reading and applying the law, not being an agent for legislative or social change. While, if confirmed, there will be cases where the future Justice Kavanaugh and The Cato Institute do not see eye-to-eye \u2013 he\u2019s not a libertarian \u2013 I hope that in those politically sensitive times where Chief Justice Roberts may be inclined to tweak a law in order to save it, Kavanaugh will be more like Justice Scalia and let the political chips fall where they may. There\u2019s no reason to delay Judge Kavanaugh a confirmation in the normal course and nothing in his record to justify the demagoguery he\u2019s already facing. I look forward to seeing him on the bench in the highest court in the land come October. Ilya Shapiro is a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute and editor-in-chief for the Cato Supreme Court Review. I have to admit it: I was hoping President Trump would choose Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Brilliant, courageous, and quick on her feet, the professionally and personally esteemed mother of seven puts to rest \u2013 in her very person \u2013 the central pro-choice feminist assumption that bearing and raising children impedes women\u2019s serious engagement in professional and public life. She would have brought true diversity to the Court on the most rancorous constitutional issue of our day, underscoring how an intellectually astute woman need not acquiesce in the unquestioning abortion rights dogma that has held the cause for women\u2019s rights hostage for far too long now. And she would have been able to make the case the best way possible: debunking the sham legal reasoning that has upheld the putative right for decades by day and blazing an alternative path with her family by night. Comparatively, President Trump played it safe: Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a legal all-star, an accomplished jurist, and a darling of the conservative judicial establishment; he can be trusted by friend and foe alike to interpret the Constitution as it is written. A solid constitutionalist, Kavanaugh will join those on the Court who are deeply skeptical of its current (internationally extreme) abortion jurisprudence. But with Kavanaugh rather than Coney Barrett, the optics do not bode nearly as well. Should the President have another chance, and should that chance come in the form of the retirement of an aged Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Trump should pull the trigger and nominate Coney Barrett. Our country desperately needs the opportunity to debate not only abortion, but to see how the autonomy feminism Ginsburg has long represented should pass away with its most cherished leader. A dignitarian feminism, by contrast, would recognize both that women and men are of equal dignity and are duly encumbered by their shared responsibilities to the vulnerable and dependent \u2013 in their own families and in the community at large. Coney Barrett would not only serve the Constitution better than most jurists of our time; she would reveal, by the very integrity of her life, a more dignified way forward. Erika Bachiochi is a fellow at the Ethics & Public Policy Center and a Visiting Scholar at Harvard Law School. Brett Kavanaugh is not the first conservative judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be nominated to replace a \u201cswing justice\u201d on the Supreme Court. In 1987, Justice Lewis Powell, then widely perceived as occupying that role on the court, announced his retirement. President Ronald Reagan nominated D.C. Circuit Judge Robert Bork to replace Powell. Democrats defeated Bork\u2019s nomination, and Anthony Kennedy was then nominated. Five years later, Kennedy cast the fifth vote to reaffirm Roe v. Wade and to limit school prayer, something Bork publicly declared he would not have done. Can the Democrats repeat this with Kavanaugh? The challenge is much harder this time. In 1987, Democrats controlled the Senate, and the key to blocking Bork was convincing Southern Democrats, such as Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, to vote no. Now, the Senate is controlled by Republicans. With John McCain likely too ill to vote, the Democrats need to convince one Republican senator and all of the Democratic senators, including several who are up for re-election in red states that Trump handily carried in 2016, to vote no. Of course, if the Democrats succeed in blocking Kavanaugh, Trump will nominate another conservative. The Democrats\u2019 only hope is that defeating Kavanaugh will keep the seat from being filled before the November elections. If the Democrats take the Senate, they surely will refuse to confirm any Trump Supreme Court nominee, following the Republicans\u2019 precedent of denying a vote and a hearing when President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland. If the Republicans retain the Senate, there is no realistic way the Democrats can keep this seat from being filled by someone more conservative than Kennedy. The stakes for this seat on the Supreme Court are enormous. The future of abortion rights, affirmative action, separation of church and state, limits on the death penalty, the exclusionary rule and so much else where Kennedy voted with the liberals easily could change with one more staunch conservative on the high court. That also was true in 1987, and the Democrats were far better off with Kennedy than Bork. The question is: Can they avoid another very conservative judge again?

Nothing causes more distress to Democrats than the thought that their hated President Trump has this evening nominated his second candidate for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. But the increasingly left-leaning Democratic Party should know that things could have been worse than the president\u2019s choice of conservative appellate judge Brett Kavanaugh. President Nixon once nominated G. Harrold Carswell, a judge who Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska once defended by  saying: \u201cEven if he is mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren\u2019t they, and a little chance? We can\u2019t have all Brandeises, Cardozos and Frankfurters, and stuff like that there.\u201d Carswell was rejected by a vote of 51-45. Fortunately, unlike Carswell, Judge Kavanaugh is eminently qualified for service on the Supreme Court. He is a 53-year-old graduate of Yale Law School with a distinguished legal resume including service as Senior Associate Counsel to President George W. Bush, and as a law clerk to Justice Anthony Kennedy, the widely respected Justice he may soon replace. He has 12 years of seasoning as a Judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, widely viewed by the legal profession as the Triple-A farm team for the Supreme Court. He is a judicial conservative who professes the belief that judges should attempt to interpret the law and Constitution as written rather than imposing his personal ideology on the text.  America\u2019s democracy accords to the president the constitutional prerogative to nominate candidates to the Supreme Court. So, it\u2019s time for the Democrats to get over it. Kavanaugh\u2019s lengthy record can be evaluated by the Senate and the American public.  And fortunately for Democrats and Republicans, Kavanaugh is no Carswell. Things could be far worse. After all, Kim Kardashian appears to have been a hit at the White House recently \u2013 and non lawyers can serve on the Supreme Court.

Monday night Donald Trump made his own choice for the Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s first nomination to the Court, Neil Gorsuch, was an arranged marriage by comparison. Judge Brett Kavanaugh was not on the original Federalist Society\u2019s list that candidate Trump endorsed in 2016 to win the hearts and minds of the Christian right. He also wasn\u2019t one of the two potential nominees reportedly given the thumbs up by Senator Mitch McConnell for having the best starting prospects for confirmation. As a result, the East Room became the stage for some unsubtle political theater. Much, though not all, of Monday night\u2019s choreography seemed designed to assuage concerns of Christian conservatives. In his acceptance speech, Judge Kavanaugh stressed that he went to a Jesuit school and was from a \u201cvibrant Catholic community.\u201d It does not take much imagination to see this as signaling about his views on abortion. Meanwhile, President Trump, who rarely considers any predecessor worth citing, not only mentioned Ronald Reagan but also invited Ed Meese, Reagan\u2019s attorney general, to the event and gave him a shout out. Meese matters not just because of the link to Reagan but because of his longtime leadership of the staunchly conservative Heritage Foundation. On his own, Judge Kavanaugh sent some other noteworthy signals. He stressed his love of family, and through a series of anecdotes emphasized a belief in equal opportunity for women. In that case, he was likely speaking to an audience of four: Senators Susan Collins, Heidi Heitkamp, Claire McCaskill and Lisa Murkowski. The act of repetition in a short speech suggests an awareness that the current politics of the Senate, where the margin for victory is razor-thin and moderate women hold crucial votes, demand at least the appearance of that kind of sensitivity. The only surprise was that the likely future Justice also mentioned his and his wife\u2019s service to George W. Bush, a name that has almost no traction anymore in Washington and is an epithet in Trump circles. Perhaps this is what Kavanaugh meant by saying that he intended to be an \u201cindependent\u201d Justice. Trump no doubt looked the other way this time because Kavanaugh \u2013 who worked for Kenneth Starr in his investigation of Bill Clinton \u2013 once caused pain for the Clintons, people the President likes to torment as much or more than the Bushes. The former director of the Richard Nixon library, Timothy Naftali is a CNN presidential historian who teaches history and public policy at NYU. Only in a Trump presidency could we find ourselves in this most unbelievable of situations: the president has chosen a Supreme Court nominee, tipping a pivotal balance of power squarely in his favor, to a Court that could very likely decide the President\u2019s own fate. So while the country is in the midst of a potential constitutional crisis of Trump\u2019s own making, he\u2019s choosing the referees. Brett Kavanaugh, who started his distinguished legal career as a clerk for Justice Kennedy, and has noted his belief in the \u201cessential neutrality of the law,\u201d is an extremely well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court.  He also happens to be a staunch conservative who published a law review article noting that the indictment of a sitting president would \u201ccripple\u201d the federal government and would \u201cill serve the public interest.\u201d Here are some of the lofty questions potentially facing Judge Kavanaugh, should he be confirmed: Can a sitting president be indicted? If special counsel Robert Mueller were to find evidence of criminal conduct on the part of the president, and did decide to move forward with an indictment, (which, admittedly, I think is unlikely), the issue would certainly make its way to the Supreme Court.  Kavanaugh is on record noting his belief that a sitting president should not be indicted while in office.  Either that is sheer coincidence, or the President noted this position when choosing his nominee. Can the president pardon himself? The issue has never been legally tested, but if Trump were to attempt it, this issue would have to be resolved by SCOTUS.  Kavanaugh, a Constitutional textualist, would likely vote that a self-pardon is constitutional, merely because the text of the Constitution itself does not explicitly prohibit it. Can a sitting president be compelled to testify before a grand jury? Mueller will have to decide very soon whether or not he will proceed without Trump\u2019s testimony, or whether he will subpoena the president to testify before the Grand Jury.  Kavanaugh may get the pivotal vote on this issue. The fact that a judge was nominated by a particular president is not a basis for recusal in all cases connected to that president.  And Supreme Court justices do not have to abide by the recusal rules set for other federal judges \u2013 they make case-by-case determinations.  If Kavanaugh is confirmed, however, President Trump will have cemented a conservative legacy by defining the Supreme Court for more than a generation. At the very least, Kavanaugh should recuse himself from deciding any of the three questions above in order to avoid the mere appearance of impropriety.

President Trump took a break from pandering to his base Monday night, throwing a bone to establishment Republicans he\u2019ll need to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. For all his complaints about the so-called Deep State and despite promises to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d  in the end Trump chose in Kavanaugh, a Beltway veteran, experienced in several high-profile political battles over the last two decades. It\u2019s moderate Republican Senators and red-state Democrats that Trump needs to get Kavanaugh confirmed with at least 51 Senate votes. In order to get them, he has nominated a DC soldier with a taste for political combat.  Those skills will come in handy when Democrats try to stall or derail Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. As a young man, Kavanaugh in the 1990s worked on Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation into Bill Clinton, during which he laid the groundwork on how a president could be impeached for obstructing justice. Kavanaugh also served as an attorney in the case of Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy who was deported to Cuba over the objections of conservatives who made the child a symbol of opposition to the communist Castro regime. And in the 2000 election, he was on the legal staff for the Bush campaign during the contentious recount that gave the White House to George W. Bush. Despite the well-known enmity between Trump and the Bush family, the president\u2019s choice of Kavanaugh signals the hard reality that establishment Republicans \u2013 Bush Republicans \u2013 will control whether Trump\u2019s pick gets confirmed to the Supreme Court. Errol Louis is the host of \u201cInside City Hall,\u201d a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. As a mother of three daughters and one of the one-in-four women in this country,  according to the Guttmacher Institute, who have had an abortion, I know what is on the line if Judge Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court. Because I don\u2019t have any question about how he will rule on abortion. President Donald Trump already told us. He promised that he would only nominate judges who would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Those of us who support abortion rights are taking him at his word. Brett Kavanaugh has already ruled to limit access to safe, legal abortion. Just last year, he attempted to use his judicial power to prevent a young undocumented woman in US custody from accessing a safe, legal abortion. Fortunately, the full court on which Kavanaugh sits intervened and allowed the young woman to access the health care she needed. He also ruled against access to birth control, when he authored the dissenting opinion in the DC Circuit\u2019s 2015 ruling on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control benefit \u2013 writing that he believed employers have the right to deny their employees health insurance coverage for birth control. Now, it\u2019s on Kavanaugh to prove not only that he will \u201crespect precedent\u201d (a vague way that previous nominees have tried to dodge direct questions before turning around and ruling in ways that ignored precedent) but to prove he will respect  Americans\u2019 personal liberty and adhere to what Planned Parenthood and other groups have defined as a personal liberty standard. This means the Senate must only confirm a justice who states that the Constitution protects the right of all people to make personal decisions about their bodies \u2013 including the right to use contraception and to have an abortion. With Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, the balance of the court is at stake \u2013 and with it the constitutional right to have an abortion in this country. Abortion is normal, safe health care that has been constitutionally protected for 45 years. Women will not stand by while their most fundamental rights are stripped away. Dawn Laguens is executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. There is no right more central to American democracy than the right to vote.  Yet, this administration has undertaken relentless action to make access to the ballot box more difficult. Questions about voter suppression, racial and partisan gerrymandering and more will be at the forefront of the Supreme Court\u2019s deliberations for the foreseeable future. If, as the President has promised, his new nominee will be a \u201chome run\u201d in the manner of Justice Gorsuch, Americans have a lot to worry about with respect to this nomination.  Justice Gorsuch has already distinguished himself in the arena of voting rights by approving a process that made it easier for Ohio to purge legitimate voters from the rolls, and in joining Justice Thomas in a flawed concurrence holding that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act \u2013 the sole safeguard of minority voters against discrimination after the evisceration of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court in Shelby v. Holder \u2013 does not apply to redistricting cases. Over the next few terms, the court will be faced with significant voting rights challenges that arise out of the 2020 Census, including challenges to racial gerrymandering which continues to rear its ugly head in redistricting efforts across the country. A number of cases concerning partisan gerrymandering that were sent back to lower courts this past term will return in the near future. It is critical that any new justice recognize that voting discrimination remains part of our ongoing political reality in this country and bring a commitment to fairly enforcing federal voting rights laws. Simply put, voter suppression efforts targeting African Americans, Latinos and other people of color, remain rampant and widespread and any judge confirmed for a seat on the court must be willing to acknowledge this. While Justice Kennedy was far from perfect on all voting issues, at times he clearly recognized the need to uproot the discrimination that infects society today.  It is time for the Senate to stand up and carry out its constitutional obligation of reviewing Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s record to determine his commitment to fairly enforcing and applying the constitution and federal voting rights laws in our country.

Dick Durbin called him that during his confirmation hearings for the Circuit Court judgeship).  Present at major Republican watersheds from the Starr investigation (where he pressed for sexually explicit questions to be asked of President Clinton) to Bush v. Gore and into the Bush II White House years, Kavanaugh served as the classic inside-the-Beltway foot soldier for the Republican establishment. Born in DC, the child of two lawyers, an attendee at a prestigious prep school, Yale law school and a Federalist Society member, his story is one of the elite serving the elite. As a judge, he authored a law review article arguing that sitting Presidents should not be distracted by civil law suits or criminal investigations.  His conclusion in that article that impeachment serves as a sufficient check on potentially criminal Presidential behavior syncs up perfectly with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s identical argument.  Moreover, his opinion finding that an immigrant female teen in custody lacked the right to an abortion offered Trump a perfect blend of anti-immigrant policy flavored with a hint of pro-life. Today\u2019s nomination ensures Kavanaugh a continuing Gumpian role in future landmark conservative Republican issues.  Expect him to embrace the part.

Being able to choose if we want children, how many to have, and when to have them is core to women\u2019s personal freedoms and economic stability. Trump\u2019s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court of the United States is a direct attack on women, children, and families. A pattern is emerging in Trump\u2019s deceptively chaotic policies. In the past couple of weeks alone, Trump has attacked women with his dangerous Supreme Court pick, harmed immigrant families with his damaging immigration policies, tried to cut SNAP (food stamps) even though 1 in 4 children in our nation live in food insecure households, and even opposed a popular resolution in support of breastfeeding at the United Nations to the extent of threatening retaliation against another country that wasn\u2019t on the same page. The list goes on, as do the damages to our families and economy. Trump is wrong for our nation. Kavanaugh is wrong for our nation. It\u2019s on us to use the power of our voices and votes as the 2018 midterm elections approach. We can, and must, do better as a nation.

She is the author of \u201cKeep Marching: How Every Woman Can Take Action and Change Our World.\u201d Anyone who knows Judge Brett Kavanaugh knows he reveres the Constitution.  For 12 years on the second most important court in the country, Judge Kavanaugh has applied the Constitution as it is written.  He knows that judging means going where text and precedent lead you, in a fair-minded, evenhanded manner.  That\u2019s why he always told us \u2013 when I was his student in the classroom and when I was his clerk in chambers \u2013 that every case is a separation of powers case.  Every case is about the proper limits of the judicial role. That passion for our constitutional structure is among the reasons he\u2019s the smartest lawyer I\u2019ve ever met and the best teacher I\u2019ve ever had.  He\u2019s also a devoted father, a brilliant writer, and one heck of a middle-school girls basketball coach!  He loves his country and the law, and our nation is lucky his service to both will continue on the Supreme Court.

In May of 2016, during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d then presidential nominee Donald Trump promised to appoint pro-life judges. He told Bill O\u2019Reilly he would protect the \u201csanctity of life,\u201d saying, \u201cI will protect it and the biggest way you can protect it is through the Supreme Court and putting people in the court.\u201d During a presidential debate in October 2016, Trump said he would only select pro-life judges for the United States Supreme Court, saying if he appointed two or three judges, overturning Roe v. Wade would happen \u201cautomatically\u201d because \u201cI\u2019m putting pro-life justices on the court.\u201d Analysis of President Trump\u2019s decision to nominate federal appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh as the next Supreme Court Justice can, and should, end there. But it won\u2019t, because too many of us continue to fail to take this current president at his word. For better or worse, though, we don\u2019t have to look very far into Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s judicial past to see that his nomination is Trump keeping his word, appeasing his so-called \u201cpro-life\u201d base and working to overturn Roe v. Wade. While some conservatives argue that Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent in the 2017 case Garza v. Hargan, a case that held a detained immigrant teen\u2019s right to access abortion care in the balance, wasn\u2019t \u201cstrict enough,\u201d his argument is a dark forewarning of what could be if Roe v Wade ends up on the chopping block. Judge Kavanaugh insisted the government could \u201ctemporarily delay\u201d access to abortion, and that the Trump administration \u201chas permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion.\u201d In 2015, Kavanaugh ruled in favor of Priests for Life, an anti-abortion organization, which challenged in court an Obamacare provision that required health insurance plans to cover the cost of contraception without a co-pay, making it more difficult for poor women to access birth control. He has also been approved by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, conservative groups working to reshape the Supreme Court in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade. And when asked if the George W. Bush administration nominated any pro-choice judges during a 2006 confirmation hearing, Judge Kavanaugh replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, and we don\u2019t ask, what someone\u2019s position on issues like that is.\u201d Which is why it\u2019s no surprise that Cardozo Law School Professor Kate Shaw believes Kavanaugh might refuse to say in Senate hearings if he favors overturning Roe v. Wade. And while many are quick to try and argue that refusing to comment on previous court rulings is the well-established precedent, during day two of her Senate Committee hearing, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg weighed in on Roe v. Wade, saying, \u201cIt is essential to a woman\u2019s equality with man that she be the decision maker, that her choice be controlling. If you impose restraints, you are disadvantaging her because of her sex. The state controlling a woman would mean denying her full autonomy and full equality.\u201d The analysis will continue, to be sure, as experts, political talking heads, pundits and reporters dissect the latest Supreme Court nominee. But one thing is certain: President Donald Trump promised to appoint anti-choice judges to the highest court in the United States. He has made good on his promise.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He was a consultant to Priorities USA Action, which was a pro-Obama super PAC before it was a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Now that President Trump has bestowed the rose of Anthony Kennedy\u2019s Supreme Court seat upon Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the action moves to the Senate. Special attention there will be paid to Democratic senators who represent states President Trump won in 2016.  Should they, as Jake Tapper asked me Monday, \u201cvote with their caucus (in the Senate), against the nominee\u2026 or vote the way their constituents in red-leaning states would like you to do?\u201d Actually, this is an easy call.  Red-state Democrats should oppose Kavanaugh, period.  They should do so early and often; loudly and proudly.  Here\u2019s why: Ask Trump's court pick whether Bible is supreme \u2022 Kavanaugh is a total swamp creature. Rather than choosing a judge from Indiana or Pennsylvania or other heartland states, President Trump went with a Beltway Boy, born and bred.  Kavanaugh got to where he is the Washington way: by loyally serving powerful figures in the party \u2013 first special prosecutor Ken Starr in his pursuit of Bill Clinton, then as a legal hit man in the Constitutional drive-by shooting of Bush v. Gore. And then, finally, as an aide to Pres. George W. Bush in the White House.  Bush rewarded Kavanaugh\u2019s service by placing him on the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where he has consistently backed presidential power against the little guy or gal.  Kavanaugh is the kind of guy who sucks up and spits down \u2013 the epitome of a Beltway swamp creature.  Nobody who rides a John Deere tractor all day will be able to relate to Beltway Brett. \u2022 No one ever got beat for opposing a Supreme Court nominee. When President Obama nominated moderate Judge Merrick Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Charles Grassley refused to even hold a hearing.  Despite the fact that Obama carried Grassley\u2019s state by six percent, Grassley refused to budge.  It was a shocking breach, a dereliction of duty to refuse to even hold a hearing, much less a vote.  After that unprecedented partisan obstruction, Grassley cruised to re-election.  Other Republican senators from Obama states did the same, from Marco Rubio of Florida to Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Trump's wish for the Supreme Court may be his downfall \u2022 A \u201cYes\u201d vote will demoralize Democrats.  From the wealthiest donors to the most eager grassroots activist, Democrats are solidly united against allowing President Trump to swing the Court to the right.  Any Democrat who votes to do so may find her/his fundraising dry up and his/her volunteers walk away.  Mid-terms are about enthusiasm. Right now, the Democrats have it.  Voting for Kavanaugh would be a total buzzkill. \u2022 This fight will be about a woman\u2019s right to choose and health care.  Senior Democratic sources have told me they plan to frame the fight around these two issues.  Why abortion rights and health care?  They are issues that unite Democrats while appealing to Independents and even Republicans.  According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll, 81% of Democrats want to preserve Roe \u2013 no surprise there.  A striking 73% of Independents want to keep Roe, and even 43% of Republicans do.  Similarly, the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to undermine key patient protections of the Affordable Care Act, like the ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, is wildly unpopular.  Perhaps that\u2019s why Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia is running on it, even though President Trump won his state by an eye-popping margin of 42 percentage points. \u2022 Voting yes won\u2019t stop Trump from slamming you.  Rather than courting red-state Democrats, President Trump has been slamming them.  A few days ago, Trump traveled to Montana, where he attacked Democratic Senator Jon Tester.   He did so despite the fact that he might need Tester\u2019s vote for his Supreme Court nominee.  It is inconceivable that Trump will stand down if he receives Democratic support for the Court.  He\u2019s going to attack Democrats no matter what. \u2022 If you don\u2019t stand for something you\u2019ll fall for anything.  If President  Trump is able to replace Justice Kennedy with a Trumpian Republican, women\u2019s rights, gay rights, voting rights, the right to use contraceptives \u2013 so much of modern life \u2013 could be upended.  Standing for principle, not caving to a bully, earns the respect of voters.  Far better to be what Mark Shields calls \u201ca conviction politician\u201d rather than just another Washington windsock.  Finally, red state Democrats should commit early.  Swing state \u2013 and pro-life \u2013 Democratic Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) announced his opposition Monday, even before Trump\u2019s pick was known, tweeting: \u201cI will oppose the nomination the President will make tonight because it represents a corrupt bargain with the far Right, big corporations, and Washington special interests.\u201d If other red-state Democrats follow Casey\u2019s lead, the spotlight will shift to pro-choice Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Let them explain to their constituents and to history why they might vote for the end of Roe v. Wade. An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s vote on the Affordable Care Act; he was not part of the court majority that upheld it in 2012.",

He was campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg\u2019s successful re-election bid as New York mayor in 2009 and served as deputy governor of Illinois from 2003 to 2006. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Despite what many of us want to believe, President Donald Trump is the front-runner in 2020. If you supported him in 2016, you have little reason to regret your choice \u2013 he\u2019s working hard to fulfill all his campaign promises. Sure, the polls often show that Trump\u2019s approval rating is underwater. But voters are a lot more than just data points graphed onto projections. No incumbent president in recent history has presided over a strong economy, not been enmeshed in a ground war and lost the next election. So, for those of us who desperately want to see a new president, just telling ourselves that a majority of the voters in key states will see what we see and feel how we feel isn\u2019t enough to actually win. It\u2019s going to take more than the constant tearing of garments and endless howls of outrage to beat him. It\u2019s going to take an outside factor \u2013 like Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement. There\u2019s no easily foreseeable reason the Senate won\u2019t be able to confirm whomever Trump nominates. In theory, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, could join the 49 Democrats and slow the process, but it may not be realistic to expect every Democrat to stick together, particularly ones up for re-election in red states. That means the next Supreme Court justice will likely view Roe v. Wade as bad law and eventually vote to overturn it. If the Republicans are smart, they\u2019ll do everything in their power to persuade the court to wait until after the 2020 election, since according to the latest Pew poll, a majority of Americans support abortion in all or most cases. But let\u2019s say the five conservative justices can\u2019t restrain themselves, accept a case that challenges the underpinnings of Roe, and then overturn 45 years of precedent giving women the right to choose. From a moral standpoint, it\u2019s hard to imagine a worse outcome. But from a political standpoint, it may be the only way to beat Trump. The Supreme Court line that Trump cannot cross Right now, it\u2019s easy to imagine the Democrats\u2019 campaign against Trump: \u201cHe\u2019s amoral. He\u2019s diminished the presidency. He\u2019s corrupt. He\u2019s racist. He\u2019s allegedly had sex with a porn star. His West Wing is in constant chaos.\u201d All that may be true (though Trump still denies the Stormy Daniels piece). But absent a real case with overwhelming evidence from special counsel Robert Mueller against Trump, none of it is likely to materially change turnout in 2020. The voters knew pretty much all this when they picked him last time \u2013 and that was before he could boast of peace and prosperity (assuming that holds for two more years). But what if the election isn\u2019t about Trump? If the court hears a challenge to Roe before the next presidential election, it is likely to happen soon. The 8th Circuit, one of the most conservative appellate courts in the country, is reviewing several state abortion law cases from Missouri, Arkansas and Iowa that are good candidates to be appealed to the Supreme Court. If the court takes up one of these cases, it could issue a ruling as early as spring or summer 2020 \u2013 smack in the middle of election season. If states are suddenly given the power to ban abortion, that changes the election \u2013 completely. Trump should pick a woman for Supreme Court Hard core anti-choice voters already voted in 2016. They\u2019re going to turn out again in 2020. We know what their ceiling is. But scores of independents, young progressives and people of color stayed home in 2016 because, for many of them, the election was just a choice between two personalities. Whether they like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden or Kamala Harris wouldn\u2019t be particularly important in 2020, because it would no longer be an election about an individual \u2013 it would be an election about a cause, a freedom, a right. It would not be about them. It would be about you. It\u2019s about putting people in power in the House, the Senate and the Oval Office who can restore your right to choose. That\u2019s it. All the flaws of the pro-choice candidate would no longer matter.  There\u2019s no doubt that Trump will nominate an anti-abortion judge to the court. There\u2019s not much doubt that his nominee is all but confirmed. And absent a ground war or a recession, there\u2019s little reason to expect a different outcome in the next election. Unless the game completely changes. There\u2019s one issue in American politics capable of flipping an entire election on its head. And with Kennedy\u2019s retirement, it\u2019s staring us in the face.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael D\u2019Antonio is author of the book, \u201cNever Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\u201d (St. Martin\u2019s Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. As a fixer, Michael Cohen is a disaster. Charged with protecting then-candidate Donald Trump from the negative publicity that would arise from his alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels, he created Essential Consultants, a company which tried \u2013 and, as the last few months prove, failed \u2013 to buy her silence for $130,000. And after Trump became president, Cohen kept using Essential Consultants to do business with clients who sought his advice on financial matters and dealings with the Trump administration. Millions of dollars flowed into the firm from companies that believed, for the right price, the President\u2019s fixer could assist them. If Trump wants to end Stormy Daniels scandal, he should follow her advice, or tell the truth Now it seems the firm that Cohen used to help get Trump elected could threaten the presidency. We know that Cohen is the man behind Essential Consultants because he signed the paperwork that established it as a limited liability company. The rules governing LLCs allow those who create them to hide their identities. Cohen\u2019s signature is the sign of an amateur at work and belies his claim to be Trump\u2019s best problem solver. But let\u2019s break down Cohen\u2019s fixer issues even further. Essential Consultants\u2019 first product, the hush agreement with Daniels, may not have been fully executed and is now subject to Stormy Daniels\u2019 legal challenge, which is being pursued by attorney Michael Avenatti. To watch Avenatti at work, in the legal system as well as the court of public opinion, is to witness a craftsman at the height of his abilities. Given the opening provided by Cohen\u2019s contract, Avenatti has gathered evidence to construct a clear narrative with steady revelations that threaten both Cohen and Trump. Avenatti\u2019s ability to capture attention rivals even Trump\u2019s, as he hints at bombshell revelations and then delivers on his promises. Anderson Cooper: It seems moronic for Cohen Avenatti\u2019s most recent disclosures show that Cohen used Essential Consultants to bill corporate clients, including one, Columbus Nova, an investment firm run by Andrew Intrater, a cousin of Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. As a friend of Vladimir Putin, Vekselberg, who was recently subject to US sanctions, is the kind of character both Cohen and Trump should avoid at all costs.  Instead Cohen allegedly accepted $500,000 from Columbus Nova. According to Avenatti, Essential Consultants LLC also took in more than $4 million since it was created at the close of the 2016 election. Avenatti claims that $187,500 came from Republican donor Elliott Broidy. The Wall Street Journal reports that Essential Consultants then paid $1.6 million in hush money to Playboy model Shera Bechard, who had an abortion after, she alleges, Broidy impregnated her. The agreement that was supposed to cover up the alleged Broidy/Bechard affair employs the same pseudonyms, \u201cDavid Dennison\u201d and \u201cPeggy Peterson,\u201d that were used to hide the identities of the principals in agreement between Daniels and Trump. This practice suggests that Cohen was using legal boilerplate and was too lazy to even create original fake names. Meanwhile, several of the other payments that Avenatti alleges Cohen received show that he had been trying to cash in on his relationship with Trump. One of Essential Consultants\u2019 clients, the communications giant AT&T, said it paid the LLC at least $200,000 for \u201cinsights into the new administration.\u201d Notably, at the time, AT&T was in need of government approval for its potential merger with CNN\u2019s parent company, Time Warner. Michael Cohen is learning the brutal truth about Trump According to the health news journal STAT, Cohen offered Essential Consultants\u2019 services to the drug giant Novartis, which is regulated by the US government.  After acknowledging the company dumped $1.2 million into Essential Consultants, a spokesman said,  \u201cThis episode was clearly a mistake.\u201d Only a na\u00eff would fail to see that Cohen was selling himself as a conduit to the new administration, which would make him the kind of swamp monster Trump promised to evict from the shadowy pools of politics. Even worse for the President is the scent of foreign interference created by Essential Consultants\u2019 association with Vekselberg. Why would Columbus Nova pay Cohen? The better question would be why would Cohen take the money and use Essential Consultants to do it? Here it helps to understand Cohen\u2019s past and his personality. Cohen has a long record of contacts with rich immigrants from the former Soviet Union and, according to The New York Times, built his own \u201cshadowy\u201d business empire with their help. For example, he teamed up with his father-in-law to lend $25 million to a Ukrainian businessman known for defaulting on loans. According to the Times, he was also part owner of a Brooklyn catering hall that served as an office for \u201ctwo of New York\u2019s most notorious Russian mobsters.\u201d The shadowy associations were consistent with Cohen\u2019s image as the tough guy who goes after the boss\u2019s critics and deals with threats, perceived and real, to the Trump empire.  At times, Cohen has seemed to enjoy being a figure whose very name should provoke fear in the hearts of those who would challenge his client. The most notable example of his method was a profane tirade he issued against a journalist whom he promised to harass \u201cfor as long as you\u2019re on this frickin\u2019 planet\u201d if he published a salacious story about Trump. The bullying was a fairly effective homage to Trump, but in his other attempts to copy his employer, Cohen proved to be inept. Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of Essential Consultants. In his decadeslong career marked by bankruptcies and controversies, Trump was exceedingly careful about protecting himself. Indeed, the very fact that he used Cohen as a so-called fixer indicates that he was willing to pay good money so that he could act with impunity \u2013 and without the kind of consequences Cohen faces in his battle with Avenatti. The saga of Essential Consultants proves that Cohen is no Trump. He may not even be a very good Cohen. If he were, the stuff he was supposed to fix would have stayed fixed. Instead, he has set his own life on fire, and the flames now threaten the President.",

He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Back in 2008, Barack Obama inadvertently warned America about people like Conor Lamb, the upstart 33-year-old Democrat who is on the cusp of victory this week in a Pennsylvania congressional race. \u201cThey get bitter, they cling to guns or religion,\u201d the future president bemoaned to his wealthy San Francisco donors about Pennsylvania\u2019s working-class denizens. Lamb leads in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th district by 627 votes over Republican Rick Saccone, and he got there by, among other things, putting a photo of himself shooting an AR-15 in his campaign ads and by openly discussing his Catholic faith on the campaign trail. Literally, Lamb clung to guns and religion to take down Saccone, the hangdog Republican candidate who projected all the vigor of a wilted salad in his own campaign. Sure, you can try heaping dressing on it and pretend it\u2019s fine, but you would have preferred fresh lettuce. Yes, Obama warned us. Of course, he was thinking of Republicans at the time, trying to explain the Democratic Party\u2019s travails among working class and rural voters. Ten years later, Democrats have adopted a new strategy: if you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em. By embracing Lamb, the Democrats did what they had to do in a district Donald Trump won by 20 points in 2016: they ran a candidate who sounded an awful lot like one of Obama\u2019s bitter Keystone gun clingers. Conor Lamb reacts to Trump's dig But there is something interesting about a political party, which suffered mightily at every political level from Obama\u2019s rampage through rural America, turning to the very kind of person \u2013 gun toting and religious \u2013 Obama once abandoned. Lamb didn\u2019t face a primary for this seat because of the circumstances, but if he had it is doubtful his first ad would\u2019ve featured him holding an AR-15. The resistance, as much as they celebrate his win, might not have allowed a candidacy like Lamb\u2019s to flourish if given a more progressive alternative. The Conor Lambs of the world are likely to be the exception in the Democratic Party, not the rule. This is not to take anything away from Lamb, who ran a great race by, as CNN\u2019s Van Jones put it during a segment on election night, breaking the \u201cideological stranglehold\u201d extreme liberals have had on the Democratic Party since Obama beat John McCain. And it\u2019s not to downplay the warning Republican congressional candidates should take away: if there\u2019s any significant suburb in your district, it\u2019s time to batten down the hatches and prepare for an unfriendly turnout matrix. Begala: Republicans are gonna need a bigger yacht Lamb\u2019s victory was propelled in part by improving in Allegheny County, the suburban part of the district, over Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 result by almost 20 points. Similarly, 300,000 Democrats \u2013 mostly in suburban areas \u2013 turned out in Virginia\u2019s governor\u2019s race last November to sink Republican Ed Gillespie, despite having no history of voting in off-year elections. Republican pundits can try to sugarcoat the outcome all they want (yes, there are local circumstances here that made a difference, including the incumbent congressman resigning because he asked his mistress to have an abortion!) but clearly, in race after race, suburban areas are swinging away from the GOP because some voters, even in the midst of a great economy, aren\u2019t happy with President Donald Trump\u2019s bearing in office. For Republicans, it is time to get used to life after Hillary, and to the prospect of unlikely voters who aren\u2019t interested in what you have to say showing up at the polls. The Democrats would be wise to embrace more candidates like Lamb, who aren\u2019t openly hostile to people who like Cracker Barrel more than Crate & Barrel. We\u2019ll see if their congressional nominees in other races match the district the way Lamb did in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, or if Democratic primary voters revert to supporting extremely liberal candidates who are culturally out of touch with working class voters.  And we\u2019ll see if Republicans will finally learn the lesson that candidate quality matters. Voters want something crisper than the wilted salad the GOP served up in Pennsylvania, no matter how much dressing outside groups (or even the President) slop on it.",

Check out the giant floating pipe that\u2019s trying to pick up all the plastic trash in the middle of the Pacific. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh this morning. He\u2019s expected to meet with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia is prepping a report admitting that Khashoggi was killed during an interrogation that went wrong, sources told CNN. Khashoggi\u2019s family, US political leaders and the international community want an independent inquiry. President Trump, after a phone conversation with King Salman, floated the idea that perhaps \u201crogue killers\u201d may have been behind Khashoggi\u2019s apparent death. The death toll from Hurricane Michael rose to 19 after a body was found in Mexico Beach. But there is some good news. The number of missing dropped down to three, the city\u2019s police chief said. Earlier, authorities said they didn\u2019t know where 30 to 35 people were in the hard-hit coastal town. President Trump toured some of the worst-hit areas in Florida and Georgia. More than 230,000 customers remain without power almost a week after Michael devastated this part of the Florida Panhandle as a powerful Category 5 storm. Schools in at least eight Florida counties remain closed because of the damage. The conflict in Yemen doesn\u2019t generate a ton of headlines, but it should. This grinding battle between Arab allies led by Saudi Arabia and Houthi rebels backed by Iran has excaberated already dreadful conditions in the Middle East\u2019s poorest country.

Mohammed Dewji, 43, a business tycoon from Tanzania, was snatched up last week by a pair of gunmen as he left a hotel gym in Dar es Salaam. Police say they haven\u2019t received a ransom demand yet. About 20 men have been arrested so far in connection with the kidnapping. Dewji\u2019s family is offering one billion shillings (about $440,000) in reward money. Dewji, who runs a massive family business with holdings in textile and food and beverage manufacturing, has a net worth of about $1.5 billion. Tributes poured in from the worlds of technology, sports and business as word got out that Paul Allen had died of complications related to non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Allen, 65, was the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft. He founded that iconic computer company in 1975 with Bill Gates, who said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the death of one of his \u201coldest and dearest friends.\u201d But Allen was more than a tech guy.

            "article_content": "At the Tony Awards a week ago, actor Robert De Niro leveled a profane attack on President Trump. On Saturday in New York, it was Trump\u2019s fans\u2019 turn. As the curtain call began for the Broadway musical \u201cA Bronx Tale,\u201d which De Niro co-directed, someone in the front row held up a large \u201cTrump 2020\u201d banner. It\u2019s not clear whether the stunt was a response to De Niro\u2019s comments. But accounts of the incident popped up on social media, sparking a debate about the uneasy marriage between Broadway and politics. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that people can\u2019t enjoy a beautiful show and embrace its unifying message without politicizing it,\u201d tweeted theatergoer Joe Del Vicario, who posted a photo of the incident. The man who held up the banner was escorted from the theater, Del Vicario said. The show\u2019s hair and makeup supervisor, Brian Strumwasser, criticized the stunt in an Instagram post, saying, \u201cWhoever the low life scum bag who thinks it\u2019s ok to post their political views at a Broadway show and disrespect everyone there who paid to watch a show that is ALL ABOUT INCLUSION was thankfully removed from the theater Saturday night.\u201d After his expletive-laden rant about Trump, Robert De Niro apologizes - to Canadians Strumwasser has since disabled his Instagram and Twitter accounts. Neither he nor Del Vicario responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. De Niro was introducing a performance by Bruce Springsteen at the Tonys on June 10 when he slammed the President in comments that were largely bleeped by CBS. \u201cFirst, I wanna say, \u2018f**k Trump,\u2019\u201d De Niro said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer \u2018Down with Trump,\u201d it\u2019s \u2018f**k Trump.\u2019\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time politics have made their way into a recent New York show. In November 2016 \u2013 about two weeks after the presidential election \u2013 a cast member of the popular show \u201cHamilton\u201d addressed Vice President-elect Mike Pence from the stage after audience members booed the politician. Pence: 'I wasn't offended' by message of 'Hamilton' cast Speaking on behalf of the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast, actor Brandon Victor Dixon said he hoped the show inspired Pence \u201cto uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\u201d And last June, pro-Trump activists tried to shut down a New York Public Theater production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d after its title character, who was assassinated onstage every night, was costumed to look like President Trump. CNN has reached out to a publicist for \u201cA Bronx Tale\u201d for comment. The musical, about an Italian-American youth torn between loyalty to his hardworking father or to a local mobster, is based on a play that was adapted into a 1993 film directed by and starring De Niro.",

            "article_content": "Hopes for a historic summit next month between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appear to be dimming, at least for now. Trump questioned whether preparations for the June 12 meeting in Singapore could be completed in time, though he said things might be worked out \u201cover a period of time.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo believes a summit can still happen. So, what happened? Some US officials think\u00a0South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met yesterday with Trump in the Oval Office, oversold Kim\u2019s commitment to denuclearization, and\u00a0Trump\u00a0also is convinced that China is to blame for the North\u2019s recent harsh tone. CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson says now that we\u2019ve all gotten beyond the initial wave of enthusiasm over a possible meeting, we\u2019re left with this sobering reality: The idea that Kim would just up and dump his nukes was a little far-fetched. Well, summit or not, at least\u00a0we\u2019ll have these commemorative coins of Trump and Kim. Whodunit? Or rather, who wrote it? It\u2019s the only question that matters this morning, as Washington tries to solve a stunning political mystery:\u00a0Who is the \u201csenior official\u201d in the Trump administration who\u00a0wrote an\u00a0anonymous New York Times editorial that slams Donald Trump\u2019s \u201camorality\u201d and decision-making and claims to be part of an internal \u201cresistance\u201d force dedicated to thwarting his worst impulses? The bombshell op-ed, landing the same week as excerpts from Bob Woodward\u2019s new book, has reportedly heightened the already sky-high level of paranoia at the White House. Defense Secretary James Mattis made a surprise trip to Afghanistan today. He\u2019ll meet with\u00a0Army Gen. Scott Miller, the new Commander of Resolute Support and US Forces-Afghanistan.

Mark Zuckerberg got through his testimony to Congress last month pretty much unscathed. He didn\u2019t fare as well yesterday with European lawmakers in Brussels. The Facebook CEO apologized for mistakes, like the data-sharing scandal and other privacy woes, but members of the European Parliament ripped him for what they said was his dodging of their questions. The forum\u2019s setup \u2013 with all the lawmakers asking their questions first, then Zuckerberg answering them\u00a0\u2013 didn\u2019t help. As it ended, Zuckerberg promised the lawmakers Facebook would respond to all of the questions in writing in the \u201cnext few days.\u201d The frontrunner in Brazil\u2019s upcoming presidential election was stabbed during a rally.

Bolsonaro\u2019s known for making\u00a0racist, sexist and homophobic remarks, but he\u2019s attracted millions\u00a0of supporters who believe he can shake up Brazil\u2019s corruption-marred political class.

The study\u2019s author, who believes the cancer could be preventable, looked at more than 30 years of research on childhood leukemia to come up with his theory.

            "article_content": "A onetime symbol of integrity, Megan Barry made history as the Music City\u2019s first female mayor in 2015. Barry sought to tackle the scarcity of public transportation options and affordable housing, and helped score a professional soccer franchise. She was popular and energetic, a regular presence at music venues and Nashville Predators hockey games. The mayor\u2019s willingness to talk about her only son\u2019s fatal drug overdose last summer engendered sympathy from residents. Those warm feelings largely continued even after the mayor, 54, publicly apologized for having an affair with her bodyguard. It all ended Tuesday with Barry stepping down after admitting to a felony theft charge related to the affair. \u201cWhile my time today as your mayor concludes, my unwavering love and sincere affection for this wonderful city and its great people will never come to an end,\u201d Barry told reporters in a three-minute appearance. The guilty plea to felony theft of property over $10,000 represented a remarkable fall for the politician: Barry once enjoyed approval ratings of more than 70%. Barry moved to Nashville in 1991 to attend graduate school at Vanderbilt University, where she earned an MBA in 1993. She worked as an ethics and compliance officer in private business. Barry, a Democrat and two-term Metro Council member, was elected mayor in September 2015 in a runoff. \u201cTonight, we start a new chapter in Nashville of the Nashville story,\u201d she said on election night, CNN affiliate WKRN reported. \u201cAnd that story is the saga that is written every day by the people in this room and those of you who are watching at home.\u201d Inside the decline, fall and resignation of Nashville Mayor Megan Barry Barry distinguished herself as a pro-business, socially progressive politician, Joey Garrison, a metro politics reporter for The Tennessean, told CNN. Barry was \u201cone of the highest-profile Democrats in Tennessee. She\u2019s known for her accessibility and remarkable visibility,\u201d Garrison said last month. Cranes are plentiful around the city where new homes are springing up. Barry\u2019s agenda included an ambitious $5.2 billion mass transit proposal for 26 miles of light rail, bus routes and an underground tunnel through downtown Nashville, CNN affiliate WKRN reported. The plan will go before voters in May. In December, the city was awarded a Major League Soccer expansion franchise. Last July, Barry lost her son to an accidental drug overdose in a Colorado suburb. Max Barry\u2019s death was complicated in part by morbid obesity, according to an autopsy. The opioid crisis came to Barry\u2019s doorstep, and the public way in which she coped with the tragedy moved many residents. \u201cShe\u2019s a Nashvillian. She feels that when she hurts, we hurt \u2026 we\u2019re a family,\u201d resident Wesley Martin said. Barry spoke openly about her son\u2019s struggles with drugs, hoping her own experience and transparency could help others confront similar problems. \u201cI cannot tell you how many people have come to me and shared their own grief stories about a loved one who died where they never talked about it before,\u201d Barry told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an interview in August. On her first day back to work after the death of her son, Barry took time to greet children commencing the school year, according to CNN affiliate WKRN. She handed out supplies and backpacks. \u201cThe first day of school in our household was always a joyous occasion. Max loved school and our ritual was that we would always take a picture every day of the first day of school,\u201d she said. Barry grew emotional, her eyes misting with tears. She talked about a \u201cnew normal\u201d of never talking to her son again. \u201cThe normal is Max is not going to text me back. The work of our city goes on. Every day, I\u2019ll get up and do what needs to be done,\u201d she said. Barry\u2019s resignation came after months of intense local news coverage about her relationship with the former head of her security detail, Sgt. Robert Forrest Jr. In January, Barry publicly apologized for the nearly two-year affair with the married bodyguard. \u201cI accept full responsibility for the pain I have caused my family and his. I am so sorry to my husband, Bruce, who has stood by me in my darkest moments and remains committed to our marriage, just as I am committed to repairing the damage I have done,\u201d she said then. But she insisted to The Tennessean that she would not step down. \u201cI also must apologize to the people of Nashville who elected me to serve as your mayor,\u201d she said in her statement at the time. \u201cI knew my actions could cause damage to my office and the ones I loved, but I did it anyway. I must hold myself to the highest standard of which the voters deserve to expect. Please know that I\u2019m disappointed in myself but also understand that I\u2019m a human and that I made a mistake.\u201d To many supporters, the so-called mistake made her appear more human. After all, infidelity in politics is hardly a new story. \u201cPoliticians locally and nationally have set the bar pretty low,\u201d Nashville resident Jonathan Blake, 41, said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have any kind of concern about extramarital affairs in public office. We don\u2019t tend to look to our public officials for moral leadership anymore.\u201d Barry remained immensely popular even after the admission. A number of residents say they were disappointed by the scandal but not outraged. They viewed the affair as a personal issue between a husband and wife still grieving the death of their son. A number of residents saw the alleged misuse of public funds as a separate issue. \u201cWe are not looking for a perfect human being as a mayor. We\u2019re looking for somebody who knows how to do the job, and who will be faithful and honest to the mission of Nashville and carry us forward,\u201d Fiona Prine, whose son was close with Barry\u2019s son, said last month. \u201cWe need a steward \u2026 and she is a steward.\u201d Under her guilty plea, Barry agreed to reimburse the city of Nashville $11,000 and serve three years of probation, according to court documents obtained by CNN. The resignation and plea came after days of negotiations between the mayor\u2019s legal team and District Attorney Glenn Funk, CNN affiliate WTVF reported. Those negotiations had apparently centered on whether Funk would agree not to prosecute the mayor in exchange for her resignation, the station reported. Forrest also pleaded guilty to theft of property over $10,000. He agreed to serve three years of supervised probation and repay the city $45,000, court documents show. According to The Tennessean, the two were often partaking in domestic and international travel for work, which led Forrest to rack up $33,000 in expenses and $50,000 plus in overtime in 2017 on top of his $84,500 salary. Nine of the trips were attended only by Barry and Forrest. In court, Funk said that between March 2016 and January 2018 Barry caused more than $10,000 and less than $60,000 of Metro Nashville city funds to be \u201cexpended unlawfully\u201d on Forrest, affiliate WKRN reported. Last month, authorities charged in court documents that newly discovered nude cell phone photos may be evidence that Barry and Forrest were having an affair while he was being paid to be her bodyguard. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Forrest used a work phone to take two photos while on duty. Investigators said evidence pointed to the possibility that crimes \u2013 official misconduct and theft of property \u2013 occurred. TBI investigators say they looked at Forrest\u2019s phone and his emails after Barry admitted publicly to the affair. Two of his emails each contained one photo that showed a partially nude or fully naked woman, court documents say. The documents do not say the woman is Barry. Chris Cummings, who voted for Barry, said last month: \u201cI think a lot of us maybe elevated her to a status that maybe isn\u2019t fair, but she was kind of that symbol of integrity, honesty.\u201d Resident Barbara Sharer was one of the residents who wrote to The Tennessean urging the mayor to resign. \u201cShe had disgraced the Office of Mayor,\u201d the 71-year-old Sharer wrote. In an interview last month, Sharer said: \u201cI don\u2019t trust her and I don\u2019t think she is capable of being mayor. She uses bad judgment.\u201d \u201cFor being a first woman mayor, as a woman that\u2019s despicable to me that she has carried on this affair for two years,\u201d Sharer said. In her farewell message, Barry said: \u201cI sincerely hope and believe that my own actions will not tarnish or otherwise detract from all of the great work they do,\u201d she said, referring to members of her staff.

            "article_content": "After authorities took Cesar Sayoc into custody Friday, many people couldn\u2019t help but notice his white van, its windows covered in eye-catching political images and stickers of President Donald Trump. Sayoc \u2013 who was living in the van, according to a law enforcement official \u2013 was arrested in Florida on Friday morning in connection to the series of suspicious explosive packages sent this week to top Democrats, critics of Trump and CNN. His van\u2019s windows were covered in stickers depicting President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and others. One sticker that read \u201cCNN Sucks\u201d was also plastered on one of the windows, echoing a chant that sometimes breaks out at Trump rallies. There also were pictures of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, CNN\u2019s Van Jones, filmmaker Michael Moore and Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, with red targets or crosshairs over their images. An edited image that appeared to be former President Barack Obama riding a tricycle also had a target on it. Another window had images professing more support for Trump that read, \u201cMy President.\u201d One graphic read, \u201cWe vote pro-life.\u201d According to a law enforcement official, Sayoc was living in the van after having been kicked out of his parents\u2019 home. The van was so conspicuous that some passersby had noticed the van even before Sayoc was announced as a suspect in connection to this week\u2019s pipe bombs. @WPLGLocal10 I have pictures of this van. I saw this van in Hollywood at a stop light o eve and thought this was strange. pic.twitter.com/ARlel48Erh It caught the eye of Michael Hebert, who filmed footage of what appeared to be the van outside an LA Fitness gym in Fort Lauderdale on July 18. Hebert, who goes to the gym, said he\u2019d seen Sayoc there a number of times and had seen the van parked outside. It stood out to him because of the \u201cpolitical tone,\u201d Hebert told CNN, \u201cwhich is wild regardless of your (political) views.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just too much political stuff,\u201d Hebert said, adding it seemed \u201ca little bit extreme.\u201d Debra Gureghian, general manager of a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, said Sayoc dressed impeccably during his stint as a delivery driver. But the one time she went inside the van it was filthy, she recalled, and full of trash, including fast-food boxes. \u201cHis van was freaky scary.\u201d Because of the vehicle\u2019s exterior stickers, she said she would not let Sayoc deliver during the day. And when he did so at night, she said, he would park the van around the corner from patrons. \u201cI got no complaints from customers,\u201d she said. A law enforcement official told CNN the van was sent to Miramar, where an FBI field office is located. Authorities covered the van in a blue tarp before hauling it away. Investigators believe that Sayoc made the pipe bombs in that van, two law enforcement sources said. Inside the vehicle were items that could be linked to the packages, including soldering equipment, stamps, envelopes, paper, a printer and powder, the sources said. Sayoc is a registered Republican, according to Florida Department of State spokeswoman Sarah Revell, who cited the state\u2019s Division of Elections records. He voted in both the presidential primary and general election in 2016, and in this year\u2019s primary election. A number of packages containing what looked to be pipe bombs were sent this week to Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Democratic US Rep. Maxine Waters of California. Democratic donor George Soros and actor Robert De Niro, who also has been a vocal Trump critic, were sent packages as well.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Jason Lewis once mocked women who were traumatized by unwanted sexual advances, including those inappropriately kissed or who had their thighs touched, a CNN KFile review of his former radio show reveals. The Minnesota congressman made his comment during a November 2011 broadcast of \u201cThe Jason Lewis Show,\u201d a syndicated radio program that aired from 2009 until 2014 before he was elected to the House in 2016. Lewis was discussing sexual harassment allegations leveled against then-Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain from his time as president of the National Restaurant Association. Cain had been accused of sexually harassing employees and having a 13-year affair. Two women who were at the National Restaurant Association while Cain was president received settlements after accusing him of sexual harassment. He denied the allegations at the time and was never criminally charged. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be callous here, but how traumatizing was it?\u201d Lewis said. \u201cHow many women at some point in their life have a man come on to them, place their hand on their shoulder or maybe even their thigh, kiss them, and they would rather not have it happen, but is that really something that\u2019s going to be seared in your memory that you\u2019ll need therapy for?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll never get over? It was the most traumatizing experience? Come on! She wasn\u2019t raped,\u201d Lewis added, using a voice mocking an emotionally distraught woman. Lewis and his campaign did not return a request for comment. After CNN\u2019s KFile contacted Lewis\u2019 campaign for comment, a law firm representing Genesis Communications Network, the radio network that produced Lewis\u2019 show, sent a letter demanding that CNN \u201ccease and desist\u201d from using the copyrighted radio show owned by the company. CNN is using the audio under the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine in order to inform the public about the congressman\u2019s former statements. Lewis is seeking re-election in Minnesota\u2019s second congressional district, which he narrowly won just two years ago. CNN rates his race a toss up, the most competitive designation. The comment is just one of many that Lewis made discussing his views on sexual harassment in 2011 in response to the allegations against Cain. He said he viewed sexual harassment law as an assault on First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, calling it \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Lewis said he did not think off-color comments, jokes and offensive remarks about or to women rose to the level of needing government enforcement. While the First Amendment protects speech from government encroachment, the right is not without limits and sexual harassment is specifically prohibited by Title Seven of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says sexual harassment in the workplace includes \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature\u201d as well as \u201coffensive comments about women in general.\u201d The commission says that although the law \u201cdoesn\u2019t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile obtained five months of audio of Lewis\u2019 show from Michael Brodkorb, the former deputy chair of the Republican Party of Minnesota. Brodkorb, who is currently a columnist for the online news organization MinnPost and works in public affairs, initially reported on several comments by Lewis in 2016. KFile contacted Brodkorb to request the raw audio files of Lewis\u2019 show, which he provided. CNN\u2019s KFile reported in July that Lewis repeatedly made demeaning comments about women during a period of 15 months on his show, including lamenting that women could no longer be called \u201csluts.\u201d Lewis later defended those comments, saying being provocative was part of being on talk radio. A GOP congressman once lamented not being able to call women 'sluts' anymore On a November 2011 show, Lewis called current sexual harassment law \u201cridiculous,\u201d saying that he can call a woman \u201choney, sweetheart, dear\u201d on the radio but not in the office. Lewis added he believed sexual harassment law was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d \u201cEver noticed how I can call Michelle honey on the radio program and not be sued for sexual harassment, but if I did it at the office, look out the lawyers come calling. You know why, in all seriousness,\u201d he said. \u201cI can call her honey, sweetheart, dear. Anything I want, even if she\u2019s an anarchist. Because it\u2019s called free speech. But under the current statutory scheme, the ridiculous nature of sexual harassment law, you have no free speech in the workplace. Did you know that? The First Amendment does not apply based on geography.\u201d \u201cAnd all of this is fundamentally unconstitutional,\u201d he added, \u201cas it is now interpreted.\u201d Lewis was responding to an anarchist whom he called \u201cmy dear honey\u201d before going to commercial. Lewis also questioned government enforcement of sexual harassment, asking when it was illegal to be offensive in America. \u201cWhat really concerns me about this is, indeed, if my employer has a particular rule \u2013 \u2018you will not have pornography on your computer. You will not call the secretary sweetheart,\u2019 \u2013 all of which are a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing, because I have no right of free speech when I\u2019m at their place of employment. If, however, somebody uses the force of law and the employer is responding to a court order or a force of law, and the employer said, \u2018well, I really don\u2019t care what you call my secretary,\u2019 but the secretary uses Title Seven and they bring a sexual harassment claim. I\u2019m intrigued to know where my First Amendment rights were taken away here? Because I think they have been. Indeed, we\u2019re not talking about laying hands on people. We\u2019re not talking about harassment to instill fear, to intimidate, which is clearly a conspiracy. I\u2019m talking about being offensive. Now, since when is that illegal in America?\u201d On that same show, Lewis framed workplace issues as being one of women being merely upset that they were now treated like men. \u201cSo they wanted to be treated like men,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWell, you know what, if you get into this environment and you\u2019re being treated like men, now you\u2019re complaining you\u2019re being treated like men.\u201d In a November 29, 2011, show, Lewis said he detested sexual harassment law because it \u201cdistorts free speech.\u201d \u201cAs you know, I was a vociferous defender of Mr. Cain during the sexual harassment allegations because I detest sexual harassment law. Sexual harassment law bestows in the eye of the beholder anything he or she wants it to be it,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt distorts our free speech rights. The law is wide enough to drive a semi through. It is, it is indeed just an albatross around the neck of every person in America who\u2019s got someone who doesn\u2019t like them.\u201d On a November 3, 2011, show, Lewis said he believed sexual harassment law was \u201cinsane\u201d to cover offensive comments at work. Lewis said those offended were just looking for money. \u201cSexual harassment law is insane. It has been insane for 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a state action and therefore it is a restriction imposed by the government. Therefore, the First Amendment applies and I\u2019m just telling you that above and beyond, the scandalous nature of \u2013 you know this is almost right out of \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird,\u2019 where every black man is stereotyped as being some sexual troll and therefore if you really want to bring them down and reinvigorate the stereotype, you accused him of sexual transgression,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cSame thing happened to Clarence Thomas by his left-wing lynch mob and now it may very well be occurring to Herman Cain. But above and beyond that, it\u2019s high time we had a national discussion on sexual harassment law because it\u2019s out of control.\u201d \u201cIt is absolutely out of control,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a quid pro quo, \u2018you have sex with me or you lose your job. We\u2019re not talking about somebody placing their hands upon somebody else. Clearly a violation of a number of things. We\u2019re talking about offensive speech being deemed offensive by someone who thinks they can shake down somebody for a lot of money and a settlement.\u201d Lewis said he thought laws would need to be entirely rewritten. \u201cThe courts need to intervene,\u201d he said. \u201cIdeally the statutes would intervene. Ideally, the EEOC would rewrite the silliness of a hostile work environment. Nobody has any clue what that is, but the bottom line is this. It\u2019s long overdue that we have a little chit chat and that we rethink sexual harassment law in America because it\u2019s out of control.\u201d Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Lewis\u2019 comments happened in 2011, not 2012.",

            "article_content": "Rapper Kanye West met Thursday with Donald Trump, telling the President in an Oval Office meeting before reporters why he supports the Republican. \u201cThere was something about putting this hat on that made me feel like Superman,\u201d West said, as part of an extended soliloquy that spanned topics from his mental health to prison reform to what kind of plane Trump should fly in. West also said the President is on a \u201chero\u2019s journey.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s stop worrying about the future, all we have is today,\u201d West said, commenting on his own presidential ambitions. \u201cTrump is on his hero\u2019s journey right now. He might not have thought he\u2019d have a crazy mother-f***r like me (supporting him).\u201d Why the Kanye West-Jim Brown lunch with Trump was a disaster The meeting had been billed by the White House as one centered on urban revitalization, workforce training, African-American unemployment, potential future clemencies and crime in Chicago. West told reporters in the Oval Office that he had been asked to speak with the President about the detriments of applying stop-and-frisk policing policies in Chicago. The President has frequently praised the program, telling a group of law enforcement last week that he has urged the city of Chicago to \u201cstrongly consider stop-and-frisk.\u201d The President said during the White House meeting that he\u2019s \u201ctotally open\u201d to an alternative to stop-and-frisk. \u201cI\u2019m totally open. If we can do it a different way, Kanye, I\u2019m totally open but they all \u2013 we all agree that we have to do something,\u201d Trump said. West also discussed clemency for Larry Hoover, who is serving life in prison in a Supermax facility, calling him a \u201cbeacon\u201d and \u201ca living statue.\u201d \u201cReally the reason why they imprisoned him was because he started doing positive for the community, he started showing that he had power, that he wasn\u2019t one of a monolithic voice, that he could wrap people around,\u201d West said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to get Hoover out because in an alternate universe I am him and I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I\u2019m moving back to Chicago(.)\u201d Prosecutors alleged Hoover ran a deadly Chicago gang called the the Gangster Disciples and oversaw a $100 million-a-year illegal drug business from jail, according to The New York Times. Law enforcement authorities caught him giving orders to associates when they would visit him in jail. According to the Times, Hoover worked as political organizer while serving in prison, creating an organization that worked toward education reform and keeping health clinics open in the poor neighborhoods. It\u2019s unclear how West learned about Hoover\u2019s case, but it has been on his radar for at least a few weeks. He recently wore a \u201cFree Hoover\u201d sweatshirt in promotional material ahead of his controversial appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d It started with Ms. Alice, but looking at her and seeing the faces and learning the stories of the men and women I\u2019ve met inside prisons I knew I couldn\u2019t stop at just one. It\u2019s time for REAL systemic change pic.twitter.com/kdKr8s6lJW West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West, has been to the White House twice in recent months to discuss criminal justice reform and the clemency process. The reality star and entrepreneur was also instrumental in securing a commutation for Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence over non-violent drug charges. Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown, who has previously discussed issues facing the African-American community with Trump, the President\u2019s daughter and adviser, Ivanka Trump, and her husband and White House adviser Jared Kushner, were also in attendance. The lunch portion of the meeting was to include a Caprese salad, roasted chicken, fingerling potatoes and asparagus, according to the White House press office. West spent Wednesday at the SoHo House in Chicago with about 40 community leaders and advisers in preparation for Thursday\u2019s White House meeting, according to two sources who attended the discussions. There was a camera crew filming the meetings, according to the sources, who did not know if the crew was filming for an upcoming episode of \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been a terrific guy,\u201d Trump told reporters of West Tuesday afternoon on the White House South Lawn before departing for Iowa. \u201cYou know, he loves what we\u2019re doing for African-American jobs, for so many different things. Median income, as you see, at an all-time high. Poverty level at the best rate \u2013 meaning the lowest rate so far. And Kanye is a smart guy. And he sees that.\u201d Violence in Chicago is personal to West, who was raised in the Windy City, named his youngest child \u201cChicago,\u201d and recently told a crowd that he is moving back, according to a video obtained by TMZ. This was West\u2019s second meeting with Trump since the 2016 election; he previously visited with the then-President-elect at Trump Tower in December 2016. The two discussed multicultural issues, education and violence in Chicago, West tweeted at the time. Trump told reporters at Trump Tower that the they had been \u201cfriends for a long time.\u201d West recently made waves by wearing Trump\u2019s signature \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and delivering a pro-Trump speech after the show went off the air. He has previously said he would consider a presidential run in the future, and told a crowd in San Jose in 2016 that he didn\u2019t vote in the election, but \u201cwould have voted for Trump.\u201d The t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate also comes the same week as West\u2019s longtime rival, Taylor Swift, entered the political arena for the first time, encouraging her fans to register to vote and endorsing Tennessee Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen and House candidate Jim Cooper, also a Democrat. It appears at least political bad blood between the bestselling artists remains. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond and Chloe Melas contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democrats, believing they are on the verge of retaking the House of Representatives for the first time since 2010, have redoubled their strategy of talking about health care as often as possible and in deeply personal terms, something Republican operatives now admit has caught them flat footed this midterm election year. Democratic hopefuls in a variety of districts across the country have blanketed the airwaves with evocative stories about their personal health care struggles for months, drawing a direct line for voters between their individual health struggles and their decision to run for office. The messaging has made health care, by far, the most talked about issue for Democrats in 2018 and forced Republicans to defend their position on repealing the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. Those same Democrats got back up from their colleagues in the Senate who this week forced a vote on a bill that would eliminate short-term health care plans that don\u2019t cover pre-existing conditions. The vote failed, but it put Republicans on the record on preexisting condition coverage, an issue Democrats are using as a cudgel against their opponents on the campaign trail. Now, in a tacit acknowledgment that health care has become an issue Republican candidates have to address, politicians on the right have begun duplicating the Democratic strategy, hitting the airwaves and campaign trail with their own personal, tear-jerking health care stories that are meant to cut against the attacks on the issue. All of this comes as approval of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 also known as Obamacare \u2013 has reached an all-time high according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The popularity, in part, can be explained by prices for the benchmark Obamacare plan stabilizing, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which said Thursday that the average plan price would fall by 1.5% in 2019, the first-time prices have fallen since the exchanges opened in 2014. \u201cThe top three issues this year are health care, health care, health care,\u201d said J.B. Poersch, the head of Senate Majority PAC, the super PAC closely tied with Senate leadership. Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive In Arkansas, congressional candidate Clarke Tucker ran an ad in April that addressed his own cancer diagnosis and pledged to \u201cstand up to anyone who tries to take your health insurance.\u201d \u201cIt just gives you a new perspective on life, on what is important and what is not important,\u201d Tucker told CNN about his diagnosis. \u201cIt made me recognize that without health you can\u2019t really do anything else.\u201d Cindy Axne, running to represent Iowa\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, has told audience about how she and her husband were \u201chad to sell our personal items on eBay because we couldn\u2019t get affordable maternity care\u201d when they had their second child. \u201cSadly,\u201d she said in a recent interview, \u201cmy story isn\u2019t unique.\u201d Democrat Josh Harder, who is challenging Rep. Jeff Denham in California\u2019s Central Valley, has framed his family\u2019s health care story as a catalyst for his congressional bid. Harder\u2019s brother was born premature, racking up a $2 million hospital bill that was mostly covered by his family\u2019s insurance plan. \u201cWhen our congressman Jeff Denham voted to take health insurance away from 100,000 people in this district and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions like my brother\u2019s,\u201d Harder said in one campaign ad, \u201cit\u2019s not just wrong, it\u2019s personal.\u201d And Sens. Claire McCaskill and Heidi Heitkamp, two vulnerable Democratic senators running for reelection in Missouri and North Dakota, unveiled ad this year about beating breast cancer during their career. \u201cTwo years ago, I beat breast cancer,\u201d McCaskill said in the ad. \u201cLike thousands of other women in Missouri, I don\u2019t talk about it much.\u201d While different topics have dominated the national conversation, Democrats have remained committed to health care messaging all cycle. In total, Democratic candidates in 2018 have spent over $184 million on health care ads, a figure that dwarfs the roughly $52 million they have spent on anti-Trump spots, the second most prevalent topic for Democrats. For Republicans, health care at $73 million is the second most discussed topic in television ads behind around $100 million in pro-tax reform spots. Over 50% of all Democratic ads run in 2018 have been on health care, according to data collected by CMAG/Kantar Media. That number is only 22% for Republicans. Polls have shown that the Democratic health care message has resonated with voters and left Republicans on the defensive with an issue that they once dominated. \u201cWe weren\u2019t prepared for an issue that was extremely positive for us in 2016 to become an extreme negative,\u201d said one Republican campaign operative. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where Republicans have typically struggled,\u201d said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. \u201cRepublicans tend to be more comfortable talking about budget outlays than demonstrating that they care about people and what they go through.\u201d Some Republican candidates have begun airing personal health care stories of their own. Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher has begun airing an ad where he stands beside his wife and daughter, Annika, who survived leukemia. \u201cPoliticians argue a lot about health care,\u201d says Rohrabacher, who is in a competitive race in Southern California. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s personal,\u201d A recent ad from Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine in Ohio is narrated by his daughter, Anna, who describes how her sister Becky\u2019s death shaped DeWine\u2019s approach to health insurance and prescription drug pricing. \u201cFamily is at the core of everything Mike DeWine does,\u201d Anna says. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s always protected Ohio\u2019s families.\u201d And Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, the Republican Senate candidate who has come under attack by McCaskill on preexisting conditions, cut an ad featuring his oldest son, who has a preexisting condition. \u201cI support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions, and Claire McCaskill knows it,\u201d Hawley says in the ad. \u201cYou deserve a senator who\u2019s driven to fix this mess. Not one just trying to hang on to her office.\u201d To some degree, Republicans have become victims of their own success on health care. Republicans for years voted for repealing the Affordable Care Act with few repercussions given the fact that Democrats controlled the White House and would happily veto any plan that took a bite out of the ACA. With Trump in the White House, though, Republicans are now forced to back up their anti-Obamacare messaging with results, making their plan to repeal a bill that is growing in popularity more politically perilous. One way to cut against that is by making the issue personal as a way to convince voters that a candidate understands their struggles and concerns, Republican strategists said. Brad Todd, a Republican consultant advising Hawley\u2019s campaign, said the ad\u2019s emotional, personal approach was \u201cthe clearest way to tell the story.\u201d \u201cAll politics,\u201d said Todd, \u201cis personal.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rick Gates continues \u201cto this day\u201d to help special counsel\u2019s Robert Mueller office in its investigation into Russians, the Trump campaign and the 2016 election, he said in a court filing Thursday. The former Donald Trump campaign aide cited the \u201cnumerous\u201d times he\u2019s visited the special counsel\u2019s office in recent months as he asked a federal judge in Washington to relax the court-ordered restrictions he\u2019s under as he awaits sentencing. Rick Gates sued by his former attorney for almost $370,000 Gates implored the judge to remove his GPS monitoring bracelet, free him from a nightly curfew and allow him to travel more freely around Virginia and Washington. His recent help to investigators shows he won\u2019t flee, the filing says, adding that Mueller\u2019s office did not take issue with the request. He has built a \u201crecord of continuing cooperation\u201d with prosecutors since he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and lying to investigators in February, his attorney Tom Green wrote in the filing. A major part of Gates\u2019 cooperation so far included him testifying at trial in August against his longtime boss and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. In two days of bitter questioning on the witness stand, Gates admitted to embezzling from Manafort and accused him of masterminding a financial scheme. During the trial, the special counsel\u2019s office said some in-court discussion about Gates and the Trump campaign would disclose \u201cnew\u201d details about the investigation. Gates had fought his charges for months after his indictment in October 2017. Since he flipped in February on Manafort \u2013 and potentially others connected to the Trump campaign \u2013 Gates has become a \u201cmodel cooperating witness,\u201d his lawyer wrote. In recent weeks, Gates was implicated in a New York Times story describing how the Trump campaign considered a proposal from an Israeli consulting group to manipulate voters through social media. Additionally, Mueller\u2019s team gained another cooperator whose past work intersected with Gates and Manafort: lobbyist Sam Patten, who admitted to illegally securing Trump inauguration tickets for a Russian connected to Manafort and to the same military intelligence unit that allegedly hacked Democrats and for a powerful pro-Russia Ukrainian who was close to Manafort. Mueller\u2019s team has not yet revealed in court filings the extent of its findings, if any, about inaugural money from foreign sources or about attempts by the Trump campaign to manipulate voters or coordinate with the Russian government. Gates served as Trump\u2019s deputy campaign chairman under Manafort. After Manafort left the Trump campaign in August 2016, Gates stayed on, then played a key role on the inauguration team. Manafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy and witness tampering one month ago, following his conviction by a jury for various financial crimes unrelated to the campaign. Since then, he and his lawyers have met with Mueller\u2019s prosecutors at least eight times, according to CNN\u2019s reporting. Manafort is currently jailed and does not have sentencing dates set yet. Gates\u2019 sentencing date has not yet been scheduled either. Typically, cooperating defendants move toward sentencing as their help to prosecutors nears its end. The special counsel\u2019s office hasn\u2019t indicated yet whether either man\u2019s cooperation would end soon or when they might head to sentencing. \u201cMr. Gates\u2019 conduct in pleading guilty and fulfilling the terms of his cooperation agreement are part of the process he willingly embarked on to effect a course change in his life,\u201d the court filing said Thursday. \u201cHe is prepared to receive the court\u2019s sentence on whatever day it is imposed.\u201d \u201cOn a much more personal note, removing the GPS monitor will contribute to the process of healing in the Gates household, which is ongoing,\u201d the filing added.",

            "article_content": "What\u2019s next? Election Day in less than one month, Brett Kavanaugh headed to the Supreme Court and American voters \u2013 maybe mobs of them \u2013 will head to the polls. President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have a legacy-building conservative to replace swing vote Anthony Kennedy and ensure a rightward tilt for decades to come. Is that worth the House or Senate majority? Their long-term accomplishment could come with a very bitter pill if voters, particularly women and independents, are turned off by what it took to get Kavanaugh seated. The wrenching spectacle of hearings in which the now-Justice Kavanaugh was accused of decades-old sexual harassment and the subsequent determination of Senate Republicans and Trump to block for Kavanaugh culminated a political battle that was notable and exhausting even in the Trump era, which is saying something. Seeking to erase Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations against Kavanaugh, Trump on Monday said the charges against him were \u201cmade up\u201d and part of a \u201choax.\u201d He argued Democrats would pay a price at the polls for their opposition to Kavanaugh. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a lot of things happen on November 6 that would not have happened before \u2013 the American public has seen this charade, has seen this dishonesty by the Democrats,\u201d Trump said at the White House as he went out the door on his way to an event in Florida. He added that he\u2019s friends with many Democrats who are going to vote for Republicans. \u201cThe main base of the Democrats have shifted so far left, that we\u2019ll end up being Venezuela. This country would end up being Venezuela,\u201d Trump said. Republicans, after a coordinated defense of Kavanaugh before his confirmation, have already pivoted to a coordinated defense of their majorities, seeking to paint those who loudly opposed Kavanaugh as part of a \u201cmob.\u201d Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell both used the term over the weekend, trying to dismiss the opposition to their guy as the feeling of a few, loud protesters. \u201cIn their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Kansas on Saturday. Whether painting protesters as a subset of unruly partisans is accurate or will be effective is very much up for debate. But the loud protests on Capitol Hill against Kavanaugh were unlike anything seen on Capitol Hill, perhaps, since 2010, when Democrats staked their majorities on passing Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, and the tea party conservatives rose up to make their anger known. Democrats are hoping something similar happens in the wake of Kavanaugh. A message that was already focused on defending that health care legislation will now also turn very much on the justice who tapped a raw nerve with the #MeToo movement. Republicans have a new name for Democrats: 'mob' There is evidence that the court, which is usually a more motivating issue for Republicans, could drive Democrats to the polls this year. In a late-September Pew Poll completed before Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, 76% said the Supreme Court was \u201cvery important\u201d \u2013 the first time in years the economy did not top the poll. As CNN\u2019s Grace Sparks wrote in September, more Democrats (81%) said it was \u201can important issue for their vote\u201d than Republicans (72%). The most-referenced important issue for Republicans was the economy, which drew 85% of their registered voters. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats said that health care was the issue most on their minds. Look for new polling to see if Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation compounds the anger of Democrats. Now that the court has that conservative majority, will it still be such a key issue for conservatives? This is a question to be answered in one month. But McConnell would love for Trump to get more nominees. He bucked his own standard in 2016 when Republicans unilaterally sat on President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland and said over the weekend there would be nothing to keep Republicans from pushing through another nominee, even in 2020, if a vacancy came open. Politics in midterms is a state- and district-based endeavor, not really a national one. While the House majority seems very much in play for Democrats, the Senate map greatly favors Republicans. Most of the contested seats involve Democrats running for re-election in states won by Trump and so presumably are more open to Kavanaugh. Only one of those senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, voted for Kavanaugh, saying it was in the best interests of his state and the desire of his constituents. The rest of the Trump-state Democrats \u2013 even seriously endangered incumbents like Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, sided with the party, and Republicans made clear over the weekend they will exploit that vote. Key Republican votes are either retiring (Jeff Flake of Arizona) or are not up for reelection until 2020 (Susan Collins of Maine) or 2022 (Lisa Murkowski of Alaska). Not even Manchin, who supported Kavanaugh, will be safe from a Kavanaugh platform by Republicans in this closing month. \u201cJoe Manchin\u2019s still a Democrat and we\u2019re trying to hold the majority,\u201d McConnell said on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate his vote for Judge Kavanaugh. I think it was the right thing to do. But we\u2019re trying to win seats.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, who turned into a pro-Kavanaugh attack dog for the GOP during the hearings and after, said he will set aside a longstanding commitment to not campaign against sitting Democratic senators. \u201cI\u2019ve never campaigned against a colleague in my life,\u201d Graham said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s about to change. I\u2019m going to go throughout this country to let people in these purple states, red states where Trump won know what I thought, know what I think, about this process.\u201d The South Carolina senator was referring to allegations from him and other Republicans that Democrats tried to slow-walk Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination and that they held allegations against him to pop just before the vote. Kavanaugh also joined in on this conspiracy theory, saying it was revenge for his work against the Clintons. There\u2019s no evidence of a conspiracy, but the allegation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, which the judge has vehemently denied, did emerge after his initial confirmation hearing, prolonging the process, causing a painful national conversation about who to believe \u2013 Kavanaugh or his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford \u2013 and making him the most tainted new justice since Clarence Thomas in 1991. A year later, a wave of new women senators took office and their ascension \u2013 now known as the \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d \u2013 is partially credited to backlash against the treatment of Anita Hill when she raised alarms about Clarence Thomas, alleging he sexually harassed her. Even before Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there were rumblings of a new \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d as a record number of women are running for office. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has kept Trump at arm\u2019s length, was also disgusted by the Kavanaugh process, but for a different reason. \u201cI think the whole process \u2013 look, it\u2019s both sides.  A pox on both houses for the way this was conducted,\u201d he said. He\u2019s tried to fill the middle ground space heading into 2020, and he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday that nobody \u2013 Republican or Democrat \u2013 comes out of the bloody Kavanaugh battle looking good. \u201cPeople in the country are appalled,\u201d said Kasich. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s like, I got to win, and you got to lose.\u201d As Democrats and Republicans try to capitalize before November, Kasich said he thinks there will be Democratic pickups and maybe a new House majority, but they\u2019re moving too far left for the country. He argued there\u2019s something larger at stake. \u201cLook, sometimes, you can have a short-term win, and the long term, you have to wonder about the soul of our country,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Deflect. Discredit. Discombobulate. The Republican playbook for combating the sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh is becoming easier to read by the hour \u2014 with a script pulled in part from their strategy to undermine the probe into Russian election meddling. As the FBI enters a fifth day of renewed inquiries into Kavanaugh and the charges made by Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, GOP leaders in Washington, along with President Donald Trump via Twitter and in a mocking speech Tuesday night in Mississippi, have been working on at least three or four parallel tracks to clear the way for a successful confirmation vote. Most Republicans have sought to toe a narrow line, saying they believe Ford when she describes her alleged assault, but that there isn\u2019t enough evidence to make it clear that Kavanaugh was the one who did it. Those less willing to let his confirmation hang on that slender reed have instead suggested Ford (and Ramirez and Julie Swetnick) are pawns in a conspiracy to upend Kavanaugh\u2019s life and career. \u201cThe Democrats are engaged in a campaign of delay and character assassination against Judge Kavanaugh,\u201d Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a reliable Republican attack dog, tweeted the morning after the Ramirez accusation was published. \u201cIt\u2019s time to vote (to confirm) this week.\u201d Trump, who has \u2013 even by his standard \u2013 been largely careful in discussing the Ford case, let the mask fall on Tuesday night during a rally in Southaven, Mississippi. Accused himself by at least 15 women of a range of misconduct, Trump mocked Ford as supporters in the crowd whooped and cheered. \u201cI had one beer. Well, do you think it was \u2013 nope, it was one beer,\u201d Trump said, mimicking Ford\u2019s telling. \u201cHow did you get home? I don\u2019t remember. How\u2019d you get there? I don\u2019t remember. Where is the place? I don\u2019t remember. How many years ago was it? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Earlier in the day, he effectively attempted to pit young men (and so, their families) against accusers, saying it \u201cis a very scary time\u201d for them. \u201cYou could be somebody that was perfect your entire life,\u201d Trump told reporters, \u201cand somebody could accuse you of something.\u201d On Capitol Hill, Republicans have tried to distract from the central question by hammering Democrats over the process that led to the current impasse. Long stretches of last week\u2019s hearing with Ford and Kavanaugh were gobbled up by speechifying senators agonizing over the means by which Ford\u2019s claims went public. Even the female sex crimes prosecutor drafted in by the all-male GOP side of the Judiciary Committee spent a chunk of her time questioning Ford trying to tease out how exactly the information from the professor\u2019s confidential letter got from the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the committee\u2019s ranking member, into the public sphere. (Feinstein has denied leaking it, and Ryan Grim of the The Intercept, which first reported on it, said the source was not from her office.) Days earlier, before the hearing, it was Trump in a tweet suggesting that Democrats\u2019 handling of the letter somehow delegitimized Ford\u2019s claims. \u201cSenator Feinstein and the Democrats held the letter for months, only to release it with a bang after the hearings were OVER - done very purposefully to Obstruct & Resist & Delay,\u201d the President said. \u201cLet (Ford) testify, or not, and TAKE THE VOTE!\u201d On Sunday morning, less than 48 hours after the full vote was delayed, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham took the next logical step \u2014 and perhaps the one most reminiscent of how the House GOP has tied up its own Russia probe \u2014 by threatening to launch a kind of counter-probe into everything from how Ford found her lawyers to who made public another anonymous letter to a Republican senator alleging more recent misconduct by Kavanaugh. After the new, ongoing background check is concluded, Graham told ABC News, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a wholesale full-scale investigation of what I think was a despicable process to deter it from happening again.\u201d A couple of days before the hearing, Trump on Twitter set the tone for Republicans and, it turned out, Kavanaugh himself. \u201cThe Democrats are playing a high level CON GAME in their vicious effort to destroy a fine person,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt is called the politics of destruction. Behind the scene the Dems are laughing. Pray for Brett Kavanaugh and his family!\u201d During his opening statement, Kavanaugh picked up the thread and began to rail at Democrats, suggesting he was the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy \u2014 one that implicated shadowy leftist political operatives with vendettas against Trump and, naturally, the unseen hand(s) of Hillary and/or Bill Clinton. \u201cThis whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election,\u201d Kavanaugh blared to the committee. \u201cFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record. Revenge on behalf of the Clintons. And millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\u201d Kavanaugh didn\u2019t mention a \u201cdeep state\u201d or accuse former President Barack Obama of \u201ctapping my phones,\u201d but the implication was plain to hear: this isn\u2019t about the allegations, the fight here is a tribal one and it\u2019s time for everyone \u2014 from US senators to voters watching from the sidelines \u2014 to pick their team. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the chamber, added a dose of historical drama too, lamenting the \u201ccruelty of the process toward the people involved\u201d and saying he could not recall a \u201cmore embarrassing scandal for the United States Senate since the McCarthy hearings.\u201d In a similar vein to the Russia probe, Republicans have also attempted repeatedly to use the news media as a cudgel against any unflattering or potentially damaging new revelations. Their standards, though, for which institutions can be trusted and those that should be dismissed or ignored shifts with the wind. When The New Yorker first broke news that a second accuser had gone on the record to say Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during college, the judge\u2019s GOP defenders sought to discredit the story by pointing out that the New York Times(!) had not, despite having some of the same information, gone to press with the same accusation. But the Times quickly \u2014 both in a comment by its top editor and in the flow of a subsequent story about Ramirez and Kavanaugh\u2019s Yale years \u2014 rejected any suggestion it held back on publishing for any reason other than, as it wrote, \u201cunlike the New Yorker, (the paper) was not able to obtain an interview with Ms. Ramirez.\u201d And yet, there was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, last Thursday, seeking to further muddy the waters by effectively conflating two separate charges against Kavanaugh and ignoring the Times\u2019 explanation of its actions. \u201cI think it\u2019s important,\u201d he said, \u201cto note that two of those sets of allegations had so little corroboration that even the New York Times, which is no conservative outlet, refused to report on them because they could find no basis for them.\u201d Again, the Times did report on the Ramirez allegations. In a story published on September 25, two days before the hearing, it featured a former college roommate of Kavanaugh saying he believed Ramirez\u2019s account and supported her decision to make it public. The story also goes on at length describing the aggressive drinking culture at the school, one in which \u201ca dozen people who knew (Kavanaugh) well or socialized with him\u201d said he had been a stumbling participant. If this all seems outlandish, bewildering or just painfully complicated, well, that\u2019s the point. For the same reasons the GOP-led Russia investigation in the House has focused as much on alleged pro-Clinton bias in the FBI as what Moscow might have done and what role, if any, Trump and his team played in its work to sway the 2016 election, the effort to \u201cplow right through\u201d and confirm Kavanaugh seems to be perpetually in search of something to discuss that doesn\u2019t involve the plain language of Ford\u2019s testimony. Now, as what\u2019s expected to be the final step in the process \u2014 the new FBI probe \u2014 nears a conclusion, the fever on Capitol Hill and in the White House is peaking. Trump over the last 48 hours has veered between pledges to allow investigators to do their jobs and remarks, at a Monday news conference, suggesting (without a sliver of evidence) that he\u2019s seen an unnamed Democratic senator \u201cin very bad situations.\u201d That, of course, has nothing to do with Kavanaugh, but it planted the seeds of an alternate narrative \u2014 something for supporters to wield in the face any doubts, old or new, over the nominee\u2019s past behavior and suitability to the court. Original? Nope. Effective? Once again, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.",

            "article_content": "Thirty-three minutes after the hearing into her accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh began, Christine Blasey Ford stood, took an oath and started to tell her story. Hours later, after Ford delivered a detailed and dramatic testimony, Kavanaugh sat in the same chair and angrily denied her allegations, claiming he was the victim of an \u201corchestrated political hit.\u201d Here are the moments that will shape the public\u2019s memory \u2013 and the calculations of senators who could vote as early as Friday on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination \u2013 of Thursday\u2019s remarkable hearing. 9 opinions: What changed after hearing? Before the witness could speak a word, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and its ranking member, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, reprised their public debate over the process that led to the hearing. Grassley began by lashing out at Feinstein and Democrats for not making Ford\u2019s private letter public sooner and defended the lack of an FBI probe into the allegations. \u201cContrary to what the public has been led to believe\u201d Grassley said, \u201cthe FBI doesn\u2019t perform any credibility assessments or verify the truth of any events in these background investigations.\u201d Feinstein returned volley, first noting that Grassley had not yet \u2013 after all he\u2019d said \u2013 introduced Ford, then assailed Republicans for calling the accusations and resulting firestorm a \u201chiccup,\u201d as Nevada Sen. Dean Heller did, and suggesting, like Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch had, that Ford was \u201cmixed up\u201d over what happened. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also made it clear that no matter what happens today, the Senate will plow right through,\u201d Feinstein said, alluding to a remark by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, \u201cand ensure Judge Kavanaugh would be elevated within a week.\u201d Ford, who had never spoke in a similar setting before, began deliberately and mostly stuck to her written statement, setting out in some detail her allegations against Kavanaugh. \u201cI am here today not because I want to be,\u201d she said early on, her voice trembling at times. \u201cI am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\u201d Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, she said, had locked her in a bedroom before Kavanaugh \u201cgot on top\u201d of her. \u201cHe began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy,\u201d Ford said. \u201cBrett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes.\u201d As she spoke, supporters, staffers and at least one senator, Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar, could be seen wiping away tears. \u201cI believed he was going to rape me,\u201d Ford said, testifying that with Kavanaugh\u2019s hand over her mouth during the alleged attack, \u201cit was hard for me to breathe and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me.\u201d Feinstein channeled many of Ford\u2019s critics and questioned how, so many years later, she could be sure that Kavanaugh committed the attempted assault. \u201cThe same way that I\u2019m sure I\u2019m talking to you right now,\u201d Ford said, \u201cjust basic memory functions.\u201d Later on, Vermont Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy, who had sat on the same Judiciary panel during the Anita Hill hearing, asked about Ford\u2019s most enduring memory of the incident. Her answer to Leahy\u2019s question was both emotional and scientific: \u201cIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter,\u201d Ford said, \u201cthe uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense.\u201d Leahy pressed on and Ford explained her experience in stark terms: \u201cI was underneath (Kavanaugh), while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another.\u201d When it was Klobuchar\u2019s turn, she too asked Ford to share her most acute memories. \u201cThe stairwell,\u201d Ford said, ticking off the scene around her, \u201cthe living room, the bedroom, the bed on the right side of the room \u2013 as you walk into the room, there was a bed to the right \u2013 the bathroom in close proximity, the laughter, the uproarious laughter, and the multiple attempts to escape and the final ability to do so.\u201d Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, reacted to a report late Wednesday that GOP committee members had spoken to a pair of men who each, separately, came forward to claim that they \u2013 not Kavanaugh \u2013 had assaulted Ford. \u201cThe Republican staff of this committee released to the media a timeline that shows that they\u2019ve interviewed two people who claim they were the ones who actually assaulted you,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to address this new defense of mistaken identity directly. Dr. Ford, with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you? Ford leaned into her microphone and answered: \u201c100 percent.\u201d Drafted in from Arizona, Rachel Mitchell was prodding at times over particulars. At one point she asked Ford how she got from California to Capitol Hill. \u201cIn an airplane,\u201d Ford replied. Ford has reportedly described to friends and family that, as a result of the attack, she struggles with being stuck in enclosed spaces. Whether Mitchell was seeking to undermine or cast doubt on that claim was unclear. During the hearing, Donald Trump Jr. in a tweet made the argument more bluntly. \u201cI\u2019m no psychology professor but it does seem weird to me that someone could have a selective fear of flying,\u201d the President\u2019s son wrote. \u201cCan\u2019t do it to testify but for vacation, well it\u2019s not a problem at all.\u201d After an awkward pause, Mitchell explained the line of questioning: \u201cI ask that because it\u2019s been reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because of your fear of flying,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that true?\u201d Ford said she was \u201cwilling\u201d but also hoping that the committee or a representative \u201cwould come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request.\u201d Mitchell repeatedly inquired around who paid for the polygraph test Ford took before her story became public. Ford said, more than once, that she was not sure who covered the cost. When asked again after a lunch break, her counsel interrupted. \u201cLet me put an end to this mystery,\u201d Ford lawyer Debra Katz said, \u201cher lawyers have paid for her polygraph.\u201d \u201cAs is routine,\u201d interjected the other, Michael Bromwich. Katz then leaned in again to say the same. Mitchell continued: \u201cDr. Ford, do you expect the price of that polygraph to be passed on to you?\u201d Ford said she was not yet sure, that she had not \u2013 in the tumult of the past few days and weeks \u2013 \u201ctaken a look at the costs involved in this.\u201d Both lawyers said they had taken on Ford\u2019s case pro bono, and had no expectation of being paid themselves. When his turn came, Kavanaugh immediately launched into an emotional and angry defense. He denied the allegations, allowed that Ford might have been assaulted, but insisted over and again that he was not at fault. Kavanaugh also accused Democrats of conspiring to scupper his nomination and pledged not to withdraw it. He seemed to channel Justice Clarence Thomas, when he sat similarly accused, both in temperament and language, calling the process \u201ca circus\u201d and a \u201cnational disgrace.\u201d \u201cThis has destroyed my family and my good name, a good name built up through decades of very hard work and public service at the highest levels of the American government,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cThis whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.\u201d During an exchange with Feinstein, Kavanaugh was asked again if he was denying every allegation made against him \u2013 by Ford, by Deborah Ramirez and by Julie Swetnick. \u201cThat is emphatically what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Kavanaugh said, adding: \u201cThe Swetnick thing is a joke. That is a farce.\u201d Kavanaugh leaned back in his seat, appearing incensed. \u201cWould you like to say more about it?\u201d, Feinstein asked. \u201cNo.\u201d Kavanaugh acknowledged during the hearing that he drank beer, liked beer, and still liked beer, and that he and his friends \u201csometimes probably had too many beers.\u201d Mitchell then asked what he considered to be too many beers. Kavanaugh responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. You know \u2013 whatever the chart says. Blood alcohol chart,\u201d and chuckled. Mitchell then asked Kavanaugh if he ever \u201cpassed out from drinking.\u201d He said no. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to sleep, but I\u2019ve never blacked out. That\u2019s the allegation, and that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s wrong.\u201d Like his Republican colleagues, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham deferred to Mitchell during Ford\u2019s testimony. But when Kavanaugh\u2019s turn came up, Graham unleashed a prolonged attack on the committee\u2019s Democrats and even, at one point, seemed to warn Republicans to fall in line and back the nominee. \u201cIf you wanted a FBI investigation, you could have come to us. What you want to do is destroy this guy\u2019s life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020 \u2013 you\u2019ve said that, not me,\u201d Graham said to the Democrats. Turning to Kavanaugh, he added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to apologize for.\u201d Klobuchar tried asking the question and Kavanaugh repeatedly refused to answer \u2013 and repeatedly attempted to turn it around on the Minnesota senator. This was the exchange: Klobuchar: \u201cIn your written testimony, you said sometimes you had too many drinks. Was there ever a time when you drank so much that you couldn\u2019t remember what happened or part of what happened the night before?\u201d Kavanaugh: \u201cNo, I remember what happened and I think you\u2019ve probably had beer, senator, and so\u2013 Klobuchar: \u201cSo you\u2019re saying there\u2019s never been a case where you drank so much that you didn\u2019t remember what happened the night before or part of what happened? Kavanaugh: \u201cYou\u2019re asking about, yeah, blackout\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Have you? Klobuchar: \u201cCould you answer the question, judge? So you\u2026 that\u2019s not happened? Is that your answer?\u201d Kavanaugh: \u201cYeah and I\u2019m curious if you have. Klobuchar: \u201cI have no drinking problem, judge.\u201d Kavanaugh: \u201cNor do I.\u201d After a break in the hearing, Kavanaugh apologized for answering Klobuchar\u2019s question with his own. After handling nearly all the questioning responsibilities during Ford\u2019s testimony and the beginning of Kavanaugh\u2019s, the Arizona prosecutor mostly disappeared from the scene. Though she physically remained at her desk, positioned at the foot of the dais, Republicans increasingly began to take their own turns, leaving Mitchell with little to do as the hearing progressed into its later hours. Her reduced role seemed to coincide with a growing sense of confidence, mixed with frustration among conservatives over Mitchell\u2019s performance, from the GOP members of the committee.

            "article_content": "The Republican candidates in Florida\u2019s hotly contested races for governor and US Senate are experiencing first hand the challenges of navigating politics in the age of Donald Trump. The President\u2019s false claims last week about the death toll in Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria led Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for Senate, and gubernatorial nominee and former Rep. Ron DeSantis to issue statements breaking with Trump\u2019s assertions. Now, a source tells CNN, Trump is angered by both candidates\u2019 efforts to distance themselves from him. The episode highlights the difficult position Scott and DeSantis are in. If they completely embrace Trump, even in his most controversial moments, they risk alienating key swing voters who are turned off by the President\u2019s statements. If they go too far in breaking with Trump, they could anger the President and as a result his core supporters, who they need to turn out in full force in order to win in Florida, where statewide elections can be incredibly close. Top Florida Republicans distance themselves from Trump's false claims on Puerto Rican death toll At the same time, Scott and DeSantis\u2019 Democratic opponents have tried to tie them to Trump during the course of the campaign. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson\u2019s campaign released a Spanish language ad prominently featuring photos of Trump and Scott together. Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, responding to DeSantis saying electing Gillum would \u201cmonkey this up\u201d if the black Democrat was elected, told Fox News, \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that Mr. DeSantis is taking a page directly from the campaign manual of Donald Trump.\u201d Both Scott and DeSantis have attempted to turn the focus of their campaigns back to local issues and their own individual records. Scott just wrapped up a multi-city bus tour where he promised to \u201cMake Washington Work,\u201d while DeSantis is touring schools across Florida touting his education plan, which puts a heavy emphasis on school choice. But attempting to avoid the topic of Trump is no easy task, in part because of the President himself. Last week, Trump tweeted that \u201c3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000.\u201d His false claims were quickly met with pushback from the two Republicans in Florida, which has a large Puerto Rican population and where thousands from the island are estimated to have relocated after Hurricane Maria relocated after Hurricane Maria Scott, who was already keeping Trump at an arm\u2019s length during his campaign, tweeted, \u201cI disagree with @POTUS, An independent study said thousands were lost and Gov. Rossell\u00f3 agreed.\u201d Scott was referring to an independent study that was conducted by researchers at George Washington University, which led governor of Puerto Rico to raise the death toll from Hurricane Maria to an estimated 2,975 from 64. Even more surprising was a statement from the DeSantis campaign, which did not mention Trump by name but clearly argued against the President\u2019s claim. DeSantis won his primary in part by casting himself as the most pro-Trump candidate. \u201cRon DeSantis has always worked to help the Puerto Rican community, both on the Island and here in Florida,\u201d said Stephen Lawson, communications director for the DeSantis campaign. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe any loss of life has been inflated. Ron is focused on continuing to help our Puerto Rican neighbors recover and create opportunities for those who have moved to Florida succeed.\u201d A source close to the White House who is familiar with the President\u2019s thinking told CNN that Trump is unhappy with both candidates. The source says Trump is \u201cupset\u201d that DeSantis broke with him on the tweet, although the source downplayed the long-term damage that this might have on the two\u2019s relationship, likening it to \u201ca parent and a child fighting.\u201d The source said Trump has not closed the door on the relationship, adding that DeSantis still has time to \u201cright the ship.\u201d Trump, the source said, feels like he pushed DeSantis over the edge in the competitive primary, endorsing DeSantis early and appearing with him for a campaign event and that DeSantis is \u201cungrateful\u201d for his support. This person indicated that Trump immediately honed in on the DeSantis comments last week, saying, \u201cHe reads everything.\u201d Toxic algae becomes major campaign issue in Florida Senate race The source also indicated that President Trump is also not happy with Gov. Scott\u2019s crafty avoidance of appearing with Trump on the campaign trail yet as he makes his own bid to replace Democrat Senator Bill Nelson. \u201cThe President doesn\u2019t appreciate that Governor Scott doesn\u2019t seem to want to appear with him at public events,\u201d the source said, adding that Trump has privately complained that Scott will ride on Air Force One but won\u2019t appear in public with him. A spokesperson for the White House did not return a request for comment. For their part, Scott and DeSantis are brushing off the notion there is any friction between them and the President. At an event outside Orlando on Wednesday, DeSantis laughed off the idea that his relationship with the President is on the rocks. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything has changed,\u201d he said. When asked if he has spoken to the President recently, DeSantis replied, \u201cI\u2019d prefer to keep that private.\u201d Scott finds himself in bit different situation as it relates to Trump. Scott has won statewide in Florida on two different occasions and did not face a difficult primary that required Trump\u2019s support. His campaign pushed back on the idea that governor is distancing himself from the President. \u201cThe Governor talks frequently about issues important to Florida with the president and appreciates his support,\u201d said Chris Hartline, the director of communications for the Scott campaign. Scott says his relationship with Trump has overall been beneficial for Florida, leading to breakthroughs in federal funding for environmental projects and preventing off-shore oil drilling off the Sunshine State\u2019s coast. \u201cIf it is good for Florida, I am going to agree with the President. If it is bad for Florida, I am going to oppose it,\u201d Scott said in an interview with CNN on Monday. Scott did not rule out appearing with Trump at some point before the election. He just made it clear it would be on his campaign\u2019s terms. \u201cIf somebody comes down and wants to support what I am doing, then I welcome them,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "After months of vowing to fight for his innocence, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort conceded to committing several federal crimes and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department, including in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort pleaded guilty in federal court in Washington, DC, on Friday to one count of conspiracy against the US and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice due to attempts to tamper with witnesses. Friday\u2019s court activity signals Mueller\u2019s investigation will continue and delve deeper into what Manafort knows. Even in lessening the charges against Manafort, prosecutors still have significant leverage over him if he isn\u2019t helpful to their investigation. Manafort\u2019s decision to cooperate with Mueller comes just weeks after President Donald Trump called Manafort a \u201cbrave man\u201d who would not \u201cmake up stories in order to get a \u2018deal\u2019\u201d after he was convicted in a separate trial in Virginia. READ: Paul Manafort's plea He also admitted to all the other crimes Mueller accused him of since last October \u2013 from money laundering and bank fraud to foreign lobbying violations related to his work for pro-Russian Ukrainians. Those charges will be dropped if he completely complies with the cooperation agreement. \u201cI plead guilty,\u201d Manafort said to the judge near the end of the hour-long hearing. Special counsel\u2019s office senior prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told the judge that under Manafort\u2019s plea agreement, the other charges will be dropped after he is sentenced in both Virginia and DC \u201cor at the agreement of successful cooperation.\u201d Manafort was separately convicted of eight crimes by a Virginia federal jury last month. The 69-year-old now faces a likely prison sentence of almost 20 years when the two convictions are stacked consecutively. But for now, his sentencing is on hold. Manafort\u2019s cooperation deal means he will have to meet with the special counsel\u2019s office when they want to speak with him about other criminal activities, turn over all documents relevant to the investigation, testify when needed and never lie to them. The terms don\u2019t prevent other parts of the Justice Department or state and local authorities from bringing new charges. He also could face administrative claims from the government, the agreement says. \u201cYour client shall testify fully, completely and truthfully before any and all Grand Juries in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, and at any and all trials of cases or other court proceedings in the District of Columbia and elsewhere,\u201d the plea agreement, which Manafort signed a day before, says. While Trump is not mentioned in Friday\u2019s filing, nor is Manafort\u2019s role in his campaign, the news of the cooperation comes as the President continued to lambast the Mueller investigation on Twitter this week. In a statement to CNN after the news of Manafort\u2019s cooperation, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \u201cThis had absolutely nothing to do with the President or his victorious 2016 Presidential campaign. It is totally unrelated.\u201d Wearing a purple tie beneath his dark suit, Manafort looked glum as the hearing unfolded, standing next to his attorney, Richard Westling, with a court security officer standing immediately behind him. Manafort answered the judge\u2019s questions about himself, his plea and rights he will waive, including his rights to a trial and to any appeals. \u201cI do,\u201d he said repeatedly in a soft voice, waiving each right. As a prosecutor read a long statement of what Manafort admitted to, Manafort sat near the courtroom wall with his eyes closed. Paul Manafort's cooperation deal tightens the vise on Trumpworld Kevin Downing, Manafort\u2019s lead attorney, said as he exited the courthouse that Manafort wanted to make sure that \u201chis family was able to remain safe and live a good life. He\u2019s accepted responsibility, this is for conduct that dates back many years and everybody should remember that.\u201d Manafort had proffered information to the government on Tuesday, and his legal team signed the deal on Thursday. In recent days as the Manafort plea talks were ongoing, the President\u2019s legal team expressed confidence that if Manafort signed a cooperation agreement it wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the President, according to a source briefed on their thinking. In a statement Friday, the President\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani reiterated that confidence. \u201cOnce again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign. The reason: the President did nothing wrong,\u201d said Giuliani. It was the second version of the statement. The initial version, which was quickly revised, included \u201cPaul Manafort will tell the truth\u201d as part of the quote. The amended version removed the phrase. A legal source, supportive of the President and familiar with the Manafort case, said the Trump team does not believe Manafort has anything significant on the President to share with the special counsel. The White House had previously distanced itself from Manafort and downplayed his time leading the Trump campaign. But last month, Trump expressed sympathy for him and encouragement that he hadn\u2019t flipped. \u201cI feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family,\u201d the President tweeted the week of Manafort\u2019s conviction in his Virginia trial. \u201c\u2018Justice\u2019 took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to \u2018break\u2019 - make up stories in order to get a \u2018deal.\u2019 Such respect for a brave man!\u201d In their filing, prosecutors describe Manafort\u2019s scheme to take in more than $60 million from pro-Russian Ukrainians and launder that money to avoid paying taxes. His admissions include his use of offshore bank accounts to move the money, deceiving his accountants and bookkeeper and then spending the money on lavish purchases and real estate. He also admitted to lying to banks about his assets to gain millions of dollars in loans as a way to supplement his income, according to the filing. \u201cManafort cheated the United States out of over $15 million in taxes,\u201d the filing states, adding that in order to commit the crimes, he relied on help from both his longtime deputy Rick Gates and the Russian Konstantin Kilimnik. Generally, Manafort\u2019s guilty plea centers around his foreign lobbying crimes. CNN Poll: More approve of Mueller than of Trump His plea filing gives extensive detail about his political work for the Ukrainians, specifically the Party of Regions and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose government jailed a political rival and who now lives in exile in Russia. Manafort admits to his client group being a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, the filing says. Manafort used a politics center in Belgium, called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, as a \u201cmouthpiece\u201d for his Ukrainian clients, the filing says. The organization lobbied in the US and Europe, but \u201ceffectively ceased to operate\u201d in 2014, when popular revolution swept Yanukovych out of power. Manafort sought to prevent US legislators from imposing sanctions against Ukraine and condemning Yanukovych after the jailing of Yulia Tymoshenko, a political rival and former Ukrainian prime minister. At one point, Manafort pushed damaging stories about Tymoshenko in the US, including an allegation that she had \u201cpaid for the murder of a Ukrainian official,\u201d the court filing said. Manafort said his \u201cgoal is to plant some stink on Tymo,\u201d according to the filing. He and his subcontractors were paid more than $11 million for their work, which they did not disclose to the US federal government as required by law. In a second illegal lobbying effort, Manafort assembled a group of influential former politicians in Europe \u2013 including the former Austrian chancellor, Italian prime minister and Polish president \u2013 to pose as independent voices before US lawmakers, when they in fact worked for Ukraine. Manafort directed them to be paid more than 2 million euros between 2012 and 2014, the filing said. He also cultivated the former Polish president to push positions favorable to Ukraine in the European parliament, where the former president had oversight of Ukraine. In 2012, Manafort orchestrated a supposedly independent report by the prominent US law firm Skadden Arps about the trial of Tymoshenko. He paid the firm largely out of his offshore accounts more than $4.6 million for its services, the filing said, while Yanukovych\u2019s government publicly said the report cost only $12,000. He also plotted a million-dollar public relations roll-out in the US of the report so that the report\u2019s news coverage did not condemn Yanukovych for selectively prosecuting Tymoshenko. Two of the public relations firms Manafort employed on Ukrainian issues lobbied Congress, the White House and the State Department, he admitted. He also personally met with a member of Congress on Yanukovych\u2019s behalf in 2013 \u2013 telling his Ukrainian client afterward the meeting \u201cwent well,\u201d the plea filing said. Manafort then lied to the Justice Department in September 2016 about his, Gates\u2019 and his consulting companies\u2019 work for Ukraine. The proceedings Friday were the second time in under a month Manafort had faced his own guilt in court. Even following his eight convictions in last month Virginia, Manafort still faced seven charges in Washington and another 10 possible charges in Virginia, which had been declared as mistrials after the jury hung on them last month. Westling agreed in court Friday that 10 charges in Virginia on which the jury hung would be dropped later. In DC, his seven criminal counts are rewritten as two\u2013amounting to significantly fewer penalties if he had pleaded guilty to his earlier indictment. Manafort also agreed to forfeit millions of dollars in assets to the federal government. In all, Manafort will hand over five properties, including his Trump Tower condo and mansion in the Hamptons, three bank accounts and a life insurance policy. The value of the bank accounts and life insurance policy are not yet known, and it\u2019s unclear how much money Manafort owes to banks after taking mortgages out on some of the real estate. The combined value of the real estate he\u2019ll forfeit exceeds $22 million, according to prosecutors\u2019 descriptions and public records of property sales and tax assessments. Manafort will return to jail following the hearing Friday. No sentencing dates are yet set, though the prosecutors will update the court on his status in mid-November. Friday\u2019s plea deal preempts a trial that was set to start in three days with jury selection. The strain of the trial loomed large, threatening to push Manafort, his extensive political connections throughout Europe and several people and companies among Washington\u2019s lobbying and law firm elite back into the spotlight. As part of the run-up to the second trial, Manafort\u2019s lawyers filed hundreds of pages in court to fight prosecutors\u2019 allegations \u2013 having brought two appeals unsuccessfully \u2013 and his legal fees mounted to more than $1 million, according to two people familiar with his case. Manafort, Trump\u2019s top political operative from May to August 2016, has long been considered one of the bigger fish for Muller\u2019s office. In addition to the financial and lobbying charges against Manafort, the special counsel\u2019s team had said previously it was investigating allegations he colluded with Russia while working for Trump. Over the past several months, Manafort\u2019s legal options slimmed as the special counsel notched several wins against him, including sending him to jail, securing several cooperators and gaining convictions. Manafort\u2019s case marked the first indictment in Mueller\u2019s investigation. The allegations revealed last October reiterated a year of news reports that Manafort had secretly funneled income from Ukrainian lobbying contacts for years. After his arrest in October, he was detained by the court in his Alexandria, Virginia, home for more than eight months. Then in February, prosecutors filed new mortgage and tax fraud charges against him weeks after they discovered he was offering to secure his bail with homes tied up in his alleged mortgage fraud. Prosecutors also gained the cooperation of his longtime associate Rick Gates, who had been indicted alongside him. Gates pleaded guilty in February to helping Manafort use bank accounts in Cyprus and Grenadines to hide millions they had made while lobbying for Ukrainian politicians. Gates testified against Manafort in the Virginia trial, saying his former boss had directed him to commit the fraud. The special counsel\u2019s office added a second potential cooperator against Manafort two weeks ago when another lobbyist for the Ukrainians, Sam Patten, pleaded guilty to a foreign lobbying charge. Patten worked with Manafort\u2019s Russian associate Kilimnik through 2017 and admitted in court to illegally using a straw purchaser to buy Trump inaugural tickets for an oligarch. Kilimnik is charged as a co-defendant in Manafort\u2019s DC criminal case, for the witness tampering accusation. In previous court filings, prosecutors allege he had ties to the Russian GRU, a military intelligence agency.

            "article_content": "US officials met secretly with Venezuelan military officers who were plotting a coup against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, both a current and a former US official confirmed to CNN. American officials met with the renegade Venezuelan military officers several times over the last year after the Venezuelan officers made contact, but Washington ultimately decided against supporting the coup, the two sources said. The US did not provide the Venezuelan officers with any support and the plans for the coup ultimately fell apart, the sources said. The Trump administration\u2019s discussions with the Venezuelan military officers about a potential coup were first reported Saturday morning by the New York Times. The current and former US officials confirmed to CNN that report is accurate. The White House declined to comment on the meetings between US officials and Venezuelan military officers, but said in a statement the US continues to support \u201ca peaceful orderly return to democracy in Venezuela.\u201d \u201cU.S. policy preference for a peaceful, orderly return to democracy in Venezuela remains unchanged. The United States government hears daily the concerns of Venezuelans from all walks of life \u2013 be they members of the ruling party, the security services, elements of civil society or from among the millions of citizens forced by the regime to flee abroad. They share one goal: the rebuilding of democracy in their homeland,\u201d said National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis. \u201cA lasting solution to Venezuela\u2019s worsening crisis can only arise following restoration of governance by democratic practices, the rule of law, and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms.\u201d CNN also reached out to the press office of Venezuela\u2019s Ministry of Defense, who said they will not comment until they are given instructions to do so. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza responded to the news through his verified Twitter account, saying the Maduro government denounces efforts to intervene in the Latin American nation. \u201cWe denounce before the world the intervention plans and the support to military conspiracies by the US government against Venezuela. In the US\u2019s own media came to light new and crass evidence,\u201d Arreaza tweeted. President Donald Trump has previously discussed the possibility of a military option in Venezuela. \u201cWe have many options for Venezuela. And by the way, I am not going to rule out a military option,\u201d Trump said last August. Asked about the possibility of a military intervention in response to the mounting crisis in the country, the President said that is something the US \u201ccertainly could pursue.\u201d Taking military action against Venezuela would be a dramatic escalation of the US\u2019s so-far solely diplomatic and sanctions-focused response to the political and economic crisis roiling the South American country. In August 2017, Trump asked several advisers about the possibility of invading Venezuela, CNN reported in July. Trump asked advisers about invading Venezuela in 2017 The Times\u2019 report included details from the secret meetings, citing 11 current and former US officials and a former Venezuelan military commander sanctioned by the US government who was involved in the secret meetings. The Venezuelan military commander is one of many on the US government\u2019s list of sanctioned Venezuelan officials accused of serious crimes, according to the Times. The former commander told the Times at least three factions within the Venezuelan military were plotting against the Maduro government. The Times reported that one such rebel group made initial contact with the US government through an American embassy in a European city\u2019s capital. White House officials back in Washington were at first worried that the meeting request was a setup in order to record a US official appearing to conspire against Maduro\u2019s government, the Times reported. But US officials finally felt the meetings were worth the risk as they watched the crisis in the Latin American country worsen, the Times reported. Trump\u2019s administration sent a career diplomat with instructions to attend the meetings \u201cpurely on listening mode\u201d and not to negotiate, a senior administration official told the Times. From their first meeting held abroad in fall 2017, the diplomat made the assessment that the Venezuelan rebels did not appear to have a detailed plan, but instead were hoping the American government would provide guidance or ideas, the Times reported. The former Venezuelan commander told the Times that the officers never sought US military intervention: \u201cI never agreed, nor did they propose, to do a joint operation,\u201d he told the newspaper. During a second meeting last year, the officers requested encrypted radios for secure communication, the Times reported. But senior officials declined the request, according to the newspaper. A third meeting was arranged early this year, however discussions resulted in zero promises of material support or clear signs that Washington supported the rebels\u2019 plans, the Times reported. According to the Venezuelan commander, the rebels attempted several times to stage a coup. They were considering striking last July, when the election was held to replace the National Assembly with a new pro-Maduro legislative body called the National Constituent Assembly, the Times reported. The plans to stage a coup moved to March, then later the May 20 election. However, both attempts were thwarted after the plans leaked, according to the Times. The Times reported that it\u2019s unclear the amount of detail the Venezuelans shared with the Americans, yet there is indication that Maduro was aware of the secret meetings. Once the richest country in Latin America, Venezuela has plummeted into an economic and humanitarian crisis where its people are living with food shortages, overcrowded hospitals, inflation and political turmoil. The chaos and ongoing crisis have triggered a mass exodus of Venezuelans seeking refuge in neighboring countries, ratcheting up tensions in the region. Last month, Maduro survived an apparent assassination attempt after several drones armed with explosives flew toward him during a speech at a military parade.

            "article_content": "The second trial of a Blackwater contractor charged with first-degree murder for shooting unarmed civilians during the Iraq War has ended in a mistrial, according to US attorney spokesperson Bill Miller. \u201cA mistrial was declared in the case of Nicholas Slatten,\u201d Miller said in a statement. \u201cThe US Attorney\u2019s Office is reviewing the matter and has no further comment at this time.\u201d Slatten of Sparta, Tennessee, was a sniper working for the private Blackwater Worldwide security company, contracted to the State Department to protect diplomats. He was accused of firing the first shots in a volley of machine gun and grenade fire that killed or injured 31 civilians in stopped traffic in Baghdad in September 2007. Court overturns murder conviction in '07 Baghdad shooting Blackwater said the convoy Slatten was part of came under attack and had defended itself, but witnesses testified that the contractors had opened fire without provocation. Slatten previously was found guilty of first-degree murder in the slaying of a driver in the Baghdad traffic circle and was sentenced to life in prison. A federal appeals court overturned that conviction last year, and Slatten was then retried on the murder charge. An FBI investigation found 14 of the deaths unjustified, according to rules of engagement for private security contractors in Iraq. The Nusoor Square shooting exacerbated anger among many Iraqis at the security contractors in their country. Blackwater lost its $1 billion contract with the State Department to protect American diplomatic personnel in 2009, after the Iraqi government refused to renew the company\u2019s operating license. The company was later renamed and sold. Erik Prince, the firm\u2019s founder, grew close to Donald Trump\u2019s orbit during the 2016 presidential election campaign. He was a prominent Trump supporter during the campaign, spent time around senior transition officials and has continued informally advising the Trump White House on some major foreign-policy decisions. Amid renewed scrutiny, Erik Prince to host fundraiser for Russia-friendly congressman Trump appointed Prince\u2019s older sister, Betsy DeVos, to lead the Department of Education. CNN reported that Prince met with Trump and Gen. Michael Flynn during the campaign. He also gave $250,000 to pro-Trump efforts during the campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records. Prince was recruited by then-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, last summer to help devise a new Afghanistan strategy, according to The New York Times. He proposed replacing some US troops with private military contractors \u2013 like the fighters employed by his former company, Blackwater, now known as Academi. His ideas were met with heavy skepticism at the Pentagon and Trump did not embrace the plan at the time, but Prince has continued to pitch the idea in recent television appearances.

            "article_content": "Congressman Tim Ryan is at a crossroads, considering two distinct paths ahead of him. The Ohio Democrat could, as he did two years ago, challenge Nancy Pelosi to become the Democratic leader \u2013 and potentially Speaker \u2013 in the House.  Or he could, as he has been considering, run for president in 2020 to challenge Donald Trump. People close to the congressman and Democratic operatives in Washington acknowledged that the best option is likely to challenge Pelosi, a lawmaker who dozens of Democrats running for Congress are disavowing on the campaign trail. But Ryan told CNN he is intensely intrigued by a presidential run and feels like he is currently being pulled between running for Democratic Leader and running for President. His presidential ambitions appeared more on display in a colorful basement classroom earlier this month in the Cresco Public Library, though, where the 45-year old congressman from Niles, Ohio found himself at a seven-person event to kick off a door knocking session for Tim Knutson, a bookish man running to represent the area in the Iowa House. The energy in the room felt more like a lesson on the Dewey Decimal system than a campaign event, but Ryan assured people he was excited to be there, regaling the Iowans with lessons on running for office, how to win over Democrats who cautiously backed President Donald Trump in 2016 and the importance of building a Democratic bench. \u201cGo out there and get them,\u201d Ryan said, sounding like a coach in a throwback to his football playing days, \u201cbecause we need you.\u201d While Ryan drove over an hour out of the way to be there, the assembled Iowans had been through enough presidential election cycles to know what the visit was about: Ryan is actively weighing a run for President in 2020 and will make multiple trips to the first in the nation caucus state in 2018 to explore that bid. \u201cThere are only so many places (in my career) to go at this point,\u201d Ryan said as his car rolled away from the Cresco event. \u201cI am in a really unique position.\u201d Ryan\u2019s political activity in 2018 shows the uncertainty in his next steps. Ryan will travel to stump and raise money for around a dozen Democratic House candidates in the coming months, a go-to move for someone who may be asking those same candidates to back him for leader weeks after their election. It\u2019s a strategy Pelosi herself has used: To date she has raised over $87 million for Democrats this cycle with trips every week. But Ryan\u2019s schedule \u2013 which includes trips to Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Florida \u2013 is a not-so-subtle hit on Pelosi. \u201cThese are areas where a lot of our leadership \u2013 or our leader \u2013 can\u2019t go,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI think it is one of those years that is, candidates can say, \u2018I am more aligned with Tim Ryan than Nancy Pelosi\u2019 that could be really helpful.\u201d Ryan isn\u2019t wrong. Republicans have seized on Pelosi\u2019s plans to run for Speaker as their best hope to hold the House in 2018, tying the liberal lawmaker to almost any candidate they can. Democrats on the Red to Blue list \u2013 those anointed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as the party\u2019s best chance to win back the House \u2013 have responded by distancing themselves from Pelosi, with 19 of the 63 candidates already publicly stating they will not back her if they win a seat in November. Politico: Tim Ryan leaning towards challenging Pelosi Ryan had ruled out a run at Pelosi until Rep. Joe Crowley lost to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in the New York area Democratic primary earlier this year. Ryan said he was shocked by Crowley\u2019s loss, but that \u2013 and the fact so many candidates are running against Pelosi \u2013 caused him to consider another run at Pelosi. \u201cI would say there will be many calculations and that would be one of them,\u201d he said of the growing anti-Pelosi sentiment. At the same time, though, Ryan has begun to put a sharp focus on Iowa, where he has hired Pete D\u2019Alessandro, a colorful organizer and the architect of Bernie Sanders\u2019 Iowa campaign in 2016, to introduce him to the state. D\u2019Alessandro\u2019s association with Ryan was seen as a sign by Iowa Democrats that the congressman, while still weighing a run at Pelosi, is just as serious about running for President. He spoke at the Wing Ding Democratic fundraiser earlier in August, urging Democrats to embrace his Irish fighting spirit when it comes to Trump. \u201cI am ready to get into a bit of a fight. We need to come together and get in a big fight here in America,\u201d he told the audience. And he is already planning to come back to Iowa to help J.D. Scholten in his longshot bit to unseat controversial Republican Rep. Steve King. Ryan declined to say whether he wants one job more than the other, but he leaned into the fact that he may be better with everyday people than he is with his own House colleagues. \u201cI thought 18 months ago was my moment, so it is hard to tell,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut you are not running a national election (for speaker). You are running an election with people who have a personal relationship with the leader and there is a loyalty there. That is to be commended to some extent. Loyalty in this business is sometimes hard to find.\u201d He added: \u201cThe speaker thing is obviously a narrower universe. \u2026 But I do well with the public. I do well with voters. I enjoy it. I enjoy learning from them and getting to know them. And I have always been that kind of person. It is part of my personality.\u201d Ryan\u2019s run at president would undoubtedly be an uphill climb. Ryan says his biggest hurdles for the presidency are three-fold: Few people know his name, he doesn\u2019t have deep pockets and there could be a bus full of other Democrats running. But Democratic operatives already tracking the 2020 election say he has another vulnerability: He\u2019s a white man in his 40s who was pro-life and more sympathetic to gun rights five years ago. The Democratic electorate has shown throughout the 2018 primaries that they are eager for more women and people to color in Democratic politics, and the party has tilted left since Hillary Clinton lost the election in 2016. This election season has been dubbed the \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d and a host of other possible Democratic presidential hopefuls have run to the left to match the temperature of the party. Ryan says he doesn\u2019t worry that the party is moving away from him. \u201cI think time will tell who voters pick, but I don\u2019t necessarily worry about it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously there are certain things that a white guy is never going to be able to fully, fully understand.\u201d Progressives reject 'phony moderation' at Netroots Nation, setting tone for 2020 primary He added: \u201cI am never going to walk in a black guy\u2019s shoes that is 45-years-old like me. Never going to have to do it. Which is why you respect each other, which I think is part of what the next Democratic nominee or leader or candidates across the board need to say.\u201d While Ryan talks about a slew of issues on the stump, he is also full of a wonkier set of ideas to revitalize the country. Driving through Nevada, Iowa, he spotted the Camelot Theater and suggested a nationwide program to revitalize old playhouses that used to be hubs at the center of town. He includes a story about urban blight in his stump speech, suggesting the government should do more to clear out devastated houses to help underwater homeowners. And suggested one way to revitalize cities and towns outside the eastern seaboard is to move thousands of government jobs into small towns. But even Ryan\u2019s outside-the-box thinking hasn\u2019t fully prepared him for the unexpected questions that come from Iowa\u2019s excited Democrats. At his final event of the day on Saturday \u2013 a bar fundraiser for state House candidate Andrew Rasmussen in Ankeny \u2013 Ryan met John Olson, who briefly introduced himself before asking him why the congressman, in 2003, voted against the implementation of a \u201cdo-not-call\u201d list. Ryan, taken aback about being asked about the vote he took in his first year in Congress, laughed. \u201cWe have a lot of call centers in our district,\u201d Ryan said shaking his head, preparing for months more of questions from prepared Iowans like Olson.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday night, Republican California Rep. Duncan Hunter Jr. was indicted on a series of counts ranging from conspiracy to campaign finance laws, all stemming from the congressman\u2019s alleged widespread misuse of campaign cash to pay for his personal life. The 47-page charging document \u2013 which lays out the allegations against Hunter and his wife \u2013 is absolute fire, portraying a totally out-of-control member of Congress operating in an ethics-free zone. I went through the indictment and plucked out the most amazing moments. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cThroughout the relevant period, the Hunters spent substantially more than they earned. They overdrew their bank account more than 1,100 times in a seven-year period resulting in approximately $37,761 in \u2018overdraft\u2019 and \u2018insufficient funds bank\u2019 fees.\u201d Holy crap! In a seven-year period, the Hunters allegedly overdrew their bank account more than 1,000 times! Also, according to the indictment, Hunter had less than $1,000 in reportable assets listed on his personal financial disclosure forms for each year between 2009 and 2016. Talk about living beyond your means! 2. \u201cThe Hunters illegally converted and stole more than $250,000 in campaign funds to purchase goods and services for their personal use and enjoyment.\u201d I never understand this. If you want to use $250 from your campaign to buy a few personal items, I get how you can reasonably think you won\u2019t get caught. But do you think no one will ever ask questions about $250,000?!?! 3. \u201cDuncan Hunter facilitated the theft of campaign funds by ignoring his campaign staff\u2019s multiple warnings about Margaret\u2019s improper use of campaign funds, accusing campaign staff of disloyalty by \u2018trying to create some kind of paper trail on me\u2019 when they raised concerns about improper spending, and continually refusing to remove her access to campaign funds.\u201d Ah, the old I\u2019m-not-doing-something-wrong-you\u2019re-doing-something-wrong approach! Also, reminder: These people Hunter accused of \u201ctrying to create some kind of paper trail\u201d worked for him at the time. 4. \u201cThe Hunters concealed and disguised the personal nature of many of their campaign expenditures by either falsely stating the expenses were \u2018campaign related\u2019 or by falsely reporting the item or service purchased when providing information to the Treasurer (by, for example, buying personal clothing items at a golf course so that the purchase could be falsely reported to the Treasurer as \u2018balls for the wounded warriors\u2019).\u201d Buying golf clothes for yourself and reporting it as buying golf balls for wounder warriors? Oooomph. 5. \u201cThe Hunters concealed and disguised the personal nature of their family\u2019s purchases of video games using Campaign funds by falsely claiming to a financial institution that the payments were fraudulent charges and then reporting the purchases to the FEC and the public as fraudulent charges.\u201d Video games! And then tell your staff and the public you were hacked! Paging Anthony Weiner\u2026. 6. \u201cThe Hunters illegally used Campaign funds, among other things, to purchase the following: Hotel rooms, airline tickets and upgrades, meals and food, and entertainment expenses for vacations for themselves and their friends and family, including more than $14,000 for a family Thanksgiving vacation in Italy in November 2015; more than $6,500 for a family vacation to Hawaii in April 2015; more than $3,700 for a family vacation to Las Vegas and Boise in July 2015; more than $2,400 for a Las Vegas couples vacation in August 2011; and more vacations to destinations such as Lake Tahoe, Pittsburgh, London, and Washington.\u201d See point No. 1. These are people living way, way beyond their means. Hawaii in April, Vegas in July and Italy in November? Pretty nice year. 7. \u201cHousehold and other personal items for their family from a wide variety of stores, such as Costco (where they spent more than $11,300 in Campaign funds), Walmart (where they spent more than $5,700), Barnes Noble (where they spent more than $2,500), Target (where they spent more than $2,300), Michaels craft store (where they spent more than $2,200), and other retailers such as Aaron Brothers, Party City, World Market, Crate & Barrel, Pier 1, Penny, Sears, and Rite Aid.\u201d Look, I get it. Costco is awesome. And those damn massive jars of mustard cost more than you think. But who the hell spends $2,200 at Michaels? Seriously that sounds like a nightmare I had recently. 8. \u201cOn or about January 25, 2010, in Incline Village, Nevada, Duncan Hunter spent $1,008.72 in campaign funds at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa and Casino for food, drinks, and three nights lodging during a personal ski trip with Individual 14. On this day, the Hunter family bank account had a negative balance and incurred six separate insufficient funds fees (totaling $198). Also on this same day, Duncan Hunter withdrew $20 from his personal bank account, leaving a balance of $15.02.\u201d That last line is a dagger. He took $20 out and has $15 \u2013 total! \u2013 in the family bank account. 9. \u201cOn or about April 2, 2010, Duncan Hunter claimed a $257.40 reimbursement from Campaign funds for driving his car on a 468-mile trip to Virginia Beach with Individual 14, Congressman A, and Congressman A\u2019s date despite the fact that they did not use Duncan car on the trip.\u201d Wait, you have to use the actual car to get reimbursed for the miles? Huh! 10. \u201cOn or about May 19, 2010, in Santee, California, Margaret Hunter spent $307.72 in campaign funds at Target to purchase a tablecloth, three square pillows, a three-piece brush set, a metal tray, four temporary shades, four window panels, a white duck, two Punky Brewster items, a ring pop, and two five-packs of \u2018animals.\u2019 In order to conceal and disguise this illegal charge, Hunter falsely told the Treasurer that it was for \u2018teacher/parent supporter events.\u2019\u201d Punky Brewster! Soleil Moon Frye! What a blast from the past. Also, I\u2019m interested in knowing more about this \u201cwhite duck\u201d purchase. 11.  \u201cOn or about September 13, 2010, in San Diego, California, Duncan Hunter spent $164.29 in Campaign funds for, among other things, a round of golf and beer at Riverwalk Golf Club with Individual 1A. When asked by the Treasurer if this expenditure (among several others) was campaign related, Duncan Hunter falsely responded, \u2018Yessir- All good.\u2019\u201d The next time someone asks me if I just broke the law, I am going to respond \u201cYessir, all good.\u201d Amazing. 12. \u201cOn or about December 22, 2010, after the Treasurer again warned the Hunters that \u2018campaign funds may not be used for a leisure outing\u2019 even if campaign business is occasionally discussed, Margaret Hunter told the Treasurer that she refused to provide the names of individuals she allegedly took out for meals with campaign funds because \u2018that\u2019s silly.\u2019\u201d \u201cYessir, all good!\u201d 13. \u201cOn or about June 17, 2011 in La Mesa, California, Duncan Hunter spent $142.36 in campaign funds at the Men\u2019s Wearhouse to \u2018re-cut\u2019 two pairs of pants. When this charge was uncovered by the Treasurer, Duncan Hunter falsely explained the charge: \u2018Lol. Men\u2019s warehouse was a possible semi-embarrassment that I had to let ride. I used the wrong card, then didn\u2019t want to explain the forced refund\u2026\u2019\u201d Oh, I see. You didn\u2019t want people to know you got your pants tailored at Men\u2019s Wearhouse. Or you used the wrong card? Or something? \u201cThat\u2019s silly.\u201d 14.  \u201cOn or about August 6 to 10, 2011, in Las Vegas, Nevada and elsewhere, the Hunters spent $2,448.27 in campaign funds on a personal vacation with Individuals 3A and 3B. During this vacation, the HUNTER family bank account began incurring insufficient funds fees until a check from Duncan parents was deposited into the account on August 10.\u201d A cringe-worthy detail. Even as Hunter was allegedly spending freely from campaign dollars, he was hitting his parents up for money. 15. \u201cOn or about September 12, 2011, despite opposition by his Treasurer and individuals in his Washington, DC. office, Duncan Hunter hired Margaret Hunter as his \u2018Campaign Manager\u2019 at a salary of $2,000 per month.\u201d This is a move made out of desperation given the Hunters\u2019 personal financial situation. And it\u2019s one that in retrospect made things much, much worse. 16. \u201cOn or about September 16 to 19, 2011, in Boise, Idaho and elsewhere, the Hunters spent an additional $640.05 in Campaign funds for a family vacation centered on a family member\u2019s participation in a dance competition.\u201d Oh yeah, I\u2019ve seen that one. 17. \u201cOn or about February 8 and 16, 2012, the Hunters spent $306.80 in campaign funds at United Airlines for additional charges related to a ticket for Margaret\u2019s mother to fly from San Diego to Chicago. In response to whether the charge was campaign related, Duncan Hunter told his Treasurer: \u2018Yes sir.\u2019\u201d Works. Every. Time. 18. \u201cOn or about October 30, 2012, following an article in the San Diego Reader publicizing Margaret\u2019s salary and various expense reimbursements, Duncan Hunter relieved her of her formal duties with the campaign. Although the campaign was in dire financial condition, and had just canceled a pre-election mailer due to insufficient funds, Duncan Hunter continued to pay Margaret Hunter a salary from campaign funds and allowed her to keep her campaign credit card.\u201d So, the congressman fires his wife as campaign manager after getting some bad press. But he keeps paying her! And lets her still have access to a campaign credit card! (Here\u2019s the original San Diego Reader story.) 19. \u201cOn or about December 13, 2013, in Reston, Virginia, Duncan Hunter spent $63.57 in campaign funds at Best Buy to purchase a pair of gloves and a car charger for an upcoming trip to Pittsburgh.\u201d Who the heck buys gloves from a Best Buy? 20. \u201cOn or about December 30, 2013, after considering the benefits of bringing more money to the household on a basis, Duncan Hunter hired Margaret Hunter back as Campaign Manager at a salary of $2,500 per month (although the Campaign ended up actually paying her $3,000 per month).\u201d She\u2019s baaaaaack! 21. \u201cOn or about July 9, 2014, the Hunters spent $250 in campaign funds at United Airlines to fly a family pet to Washington, DC. for a family vacation.\u201d You can\u2019t go on a true family vacation without the family pet! 22. \u201cOn or about October 22, 2014, in San Diego, California, Duncan Hunter spent $204.34 in campaign funds for two greens fees, food, and drinks at the Rancho Bernardo Golf Resort, during a personal golf outing with friends, including Individual 1A. To conceal and disguise his illegal activity, he misled his Chief of Staff by describing his regular golf outing with Individual 1A as \u2018a Christian thing\u2019 with a supporter.\u201d A \u201cChristian thing\u201d? Yessir, all good! 23. \u201cOn or about March 20, 2015, when Duncan Hunter told Margaret Hunter that he was planning \u2018to buy my Hawaii shorts\u2019 but had run out of money, she counseled him to buy the shorts at a golf pro shop so that they could falsely describe the purchase later as \u2018some [golf] balls for the wounded warriors.\u2019\u201d Of all the things the Hunters have allegedly done wrong, this one is, by far, the worst. 24. \u201cOn or about July 29, 2015, in Chula Vista, California, Margaret Hunter spent $253.62 in Campaign funds at SeaWorld\u2019s Aquatica Family Waterpark to entertain family members. To conceal and disguise this illegal payment, she suggested to the Treasurer that the charges should be classified as an \u2018educational tour\u2019 as they were related to a \u2018daylong entrance and educational meet on their issues and programs.\u2019\u201d Epic \u2013 and I mean truly epic \u2013 spin here. 25. \u201cOn or about August 17, 2015, Margaret Hunter spent $152.25 in campaign funds at to make an online purchase of cosmetics. To conceal and disguise this illegal charge, she falsely told the Treasurer that the charge was for \u2018gift basket items Boys and Girls Clubs of San Diego.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s silly.\u201d 26. \u201cOn or about September 26, 2015, in Anaheim, California, the Hunters spent $229.44 in Campaign funds at Disneyland\u2019s Star Trader shop on gifts, including two Minnie Mouse Ear headbands, a Star Wars droid knit beanie, and a raglan-sleeve black-and-gray Star Wars girls T-shirt. In order to conceal and disguise this transaction, Margaret Hunter falsely informed the Treasurer that the charge was for \u2018food/bev.\u2019\u201d Tell me more about this Star Wars droid knit beanie\u2026 27. \u201cOn or about November 23, 2015 in an attempt to justify the use of campaign funds to pay for the family\u2019s trip to Italy, Duncan Hunter attempted to set up a day tour of a US naval facility in Italy. After Navy officials responded that they could only provide a tour on a particular date, Duncan Hunter said he would discuss the proposed date with Margaret Hunter, then subsequently told his Chief of Staff, \u2018tell the Navy to go f*** themselves [no alteration in original],\u2019 and no tour occurred.\u201d He seems nice! 28. \u201cOn or about February 1, 2016, in response to questions raised by the Treasurer for about ten months, Margaret Hunter falsely claimed for the first time that the Steam Games charges were fraudulent.\u201d I was hacked! 29. \u201cOn or about March 4, 2016, in Washington, DC, Duncan Hunter spent $462.46 in Campaign funds for 30 shots of tequila and one steak at El Tamarindo restaurant during Individual 8\u2019s bachelor party.\u201d Uh, waiter, yes I\u2019d like to make an order please. Can I have 30 shots of tequila? Also, one steak. Thanks! 30. \u201cOn or about December 31, 2016, in Alpine, California, Duncan Hunter authorized Margaret Hunter to continue receiving a salary for purportedly being the Campaign Manager.\u201d \u201cYessir, all good!\u201d",

            "article_content": "Missouri voters handed the state\u2019s unions and the labor movement nationwide a win Tuesday evening, opting to reject the state\u2019s right-to-work law. Tuesday\u2019s referendum in the state gave voters the chance to strike down a law the state Legislature passed last year that would prohibit employees from being forced to join a union or to otherwise pay \u201cfair share\u201d fees to a given workplace\u2019s union. Rules like this are commonly referred to as \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws, and by prohibiting requirements for employees to join a union or pay fees to a union negotiating on their behalf, they are generally understood to weaken labor organizations in places where they are enacted. The Missouri vote marked a major victory for unions in an era replete with bad signs for organized labor. Union membership levels have declined for decades, and the ascendance of anti-union politicians across the country has handed unions legislative defeat after legislative defeat. President Donald Trump\u2019s election solidified the trend on the national level, with Trump making his mark on the National Labor Relations Board and appointing a slew of pro-business judges to federal courts. And the Supreme Court, in one of the most watched cases from its recent term, overturned a ruling from the 1970s that required public employees who received the benefits of unions to pay dues for nonpolitical work of the unions \u2013 a potentially major blow to public sector unions. The AFL-CIO and other major labor groups had set their hopes and considerable resources on the effort to overturn Missouri\u2019s law by winning a \u201cno\u201d vote for Proposition A. \u201cThe defeat of this poisonous anti-worker legislation is a victory for all workers across the country,\u201d AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement Tuesday night. \u201cThe message sent by every single person who worked to defeat Prop. A is clear: When we see an opportunity to use our political voice to give workers a more level playing field, we will seize it with overwhelming passion and determination.\u201d Aurora Bihler, a St. Louis ironworker the AFL-CIO referred to CNN, sounded confident before polls closed and accused the right-to-work proponents of trying to \u201cbleed unions dry.\u201d On the pro-right-to-work side, Missourians for Freedom to Work Treasurer Greg Hoberock had told CNN earlier Tuesday that the state\u2019s lack of a right-to-work law had led businesses not to relocate to Missouri, and he predicted a downward slide for the state if it continued to go without such a rule. He said their side had been working hard as well, but that he thought the intensity from the unions nationally was to protect their \u201cway of life.\u201d \u201cFrom the unions\u2019 perspective, they view this as a battleground state,\u201d Hoberock said. A report in The Wall Street Journal ahead of the vote noted that unions had vastly outspent their opponents, with one union-backed group outspending two opposing groups almost five times over by the end of July. After the state\u2019s former GOP Gov. Eric Greitens signed the bill into law last year, unions moved to get a referendum to hold up implementation of the rule and ultimately roll back the measure. In May, Republicans were able to move the vote to August, the day of the state\u2019s primaries, instead of the general election. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted at the time of the move that Democrats in Missouri thought the change could hurt them both in their chances to defeat the measure and to maximize turnout for Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill\u2019s closely fought re-election fight in November, while Republicans argued a quicker resolution would provide certainty for businesses. Amid setbacks, the labor movement has seen waves of energy in several states, with teachers in West Virginia, Arizona and elsewhere staging walkouts to call for improved pay and funding for education.",

            "article_content": "Joe Arpaio, the controversial ex-Arizona sheriff convicted of criminal contempt, was preparing to go out to dinner with his wife on her birthday last August when he got a phone call from his lawyer. He said he would be coming by Arpaio\u2019s house with some papers that needed to be signed. The White House: Where star power and political power collide \u201cHe was playing cute,\u201d Arpaio recalled. When his lawyer arrived, he presented his client with pardon papers from the President of the United States. In an interview with CNN, Arpaio insisted that he never asked Donald Trump for a pardon and never discussed the issue with him. The news, he said, was delivered abruptly with little formality: a single phone call with a White House lawyer \u201cto see if I\u2019d accept a pardon.\u201d And just like that, Arpaio\u2019s slate was wiped clean. \u201cThen the White House put out a press release,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cBut I was not going to postpone the Italian dinner.\u201d Arpaio took his wife to Arrivederci, where they ordered their favorites: spaghetti and meatballs and baked ziti. Throughout the meal, Arpaio was inundated with phone calls from reporters. Why Donald Trump's wild week matters. A lot. To this day, Arpaio \u2013 a staunch supporter of the President for whom he campaigned for during the 2016 campaign \u2013 says he can\u2019t be sure what prompted Trump to issue the first pardon of his presidency. But he does know when serious buzz about the possibility started: after a Fox News interview with Trump in Bedminster, New Jersey, last summer. \u201cA Fox reporter came up with that question and that sort of opened the door. People started talking about it,\u201d Arpaio said. Indeed, Trump said in that interview that he was \u201cseriously considering a pardon\u201d for Arpaio. Like so many other aspects of the current presidency, Trump\u2019s wholly unconventional approach to pardons has puzzled Washington observers \u2013 and has some people hoping to secure a pardon maneuvering to catch the President\u2019s eye. \u201cThe media is the only way to send the message\u201d to Trump, Simona Mangiante, wife of George Papadopoulos, told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to reach him otherwise.\u201d The White House has already prepared paperwork to pardon dozens of people. And with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into collusion in the 2016 presidential election in high gear, there is also growing speculation about whether Trump will channel his executive power towards former aides and allies. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump expressed regret that certain individuals associated with him \u2013 including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2013 have come under Mueller\u2019s scrutiny. RELATED: What life is like for Paul Manafort in jail Trump has also teased the possibility clemency for celebrity businesswoman Martha Stewart and jailed ex-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich \u2013 comments that surprised both White House reporters and aides. One senior White House official said while Trump had floated both names privately, there had been no expectation that he planned to share them in public. Illinois GOP warns Trump: 'Stupid' to free Blagojevich Trump then went a step further: He challenged NFL players (with whom he has fought about national anthem protests) and others to submit names of people unfairly treated by the justice system who deserved to be pardoned. \u201cIf the athletes have friends of theirs or people they know about that have been unfairly treated by the system, let me know,\u201d Trump said. There was nothing celebrity about Alice Marie Johnson, the grandmother whose sentence on a drug charge was commuted, but she had star power on her side. Reality TV star Kim Kardashian West took Johnson\u2019s case directly to the Oval Office. Johnson\u2019s case wasn\u2019t the only time a pardon candidate had garnered Trump\u2019s attention through a high-profile figure. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, encouraged the President to pardon conservative activist Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign donations in 2014. Trump took Cruz\u2019s advice and pardoned D\u2019Souza late last month Still, plenty of other potential pardon candidates are reaching Trump through the conventional review process. Arpaio suggests blaming 'the adults' for kids being separated from parents at border Another White House official said the Justice Department is recommending cases to the White House for consideration, as it would under any other administration. The Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Justice Department and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein sift through thousands of clemency applications to recommend either denials or pardons to the White House, the official said, and those recommendations are handed off to the White House counsel\u2019s office, led by Don McGahn. McGahn\u2019s team then advises Trump on which course of action he should take, although the official said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of cases don\u2019t ultimately warrant a pardon or commutation. For example, within the last three months, the Office of the Pardon Attorney notified a group of roughly 180 petitioners that they would not be receiving clemency from Trump, this White House official said. Increasingly flexing his presidential muscle by granting more acts of clemency, Trump has alternated between such cases that reach his desk through the traditional Justice Department pipeline, and weighing celebrity pardon cases or cases brought to his attention by celebrities. Len Goodman, the lawyer representing Blagojevich, told CNN that he has \u201cno way of knowing\u201d why Trump said last week that he was \u201cseriously thinking about\u201d curtailing the ex-governor\u2019s jail time (Blagojevich is currently serving out a 14-year sentence). \u201cI have no way of knowing where it was coming from,\u201d Goodman told CNN about Trump\u2019s comments \u2013 though he noted that Trump knows Blagojevich and met Blagojevich\u2019s family years ago. Blagojevich appeared on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d in 2010. Still, Goodman said he has taken no unusual steps to try to get Trump\u2019s attention. A clemency request for Blagojevich was filed \u201cthrough the normal channels,\u201d he said, referring to the Justice Department, and there have been no meetings and discussions with anyone at the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re just on pins and needles hoping that there would be some good news and that Trump will follow through,\u201d Goodman said. Others are more than willing to try to catch the President\u2019s attention and make a direct appeal to him the best way they know how \u2013 through cable television. Papadopoulos\u2019s wife, Mangiante, has been pleading with Trump in recent TV interviews to pardon her husband. She said her husband, a former Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with Russians and is now cooperating with Mueller, is \u201cvery stressed\u201d and \u201chas been hugely misunderstood.\u201d Papadopoulos\u2019 lawyer has not yet formally filed a pardon petition with the Justice Department, Mangiante said, and that she has not been in touch with any members of the Trump administration to try to make a personal appeal because she doesn\u2019t know how. Going through the media is her best hope, she said. It was a strategy that helped Kathleen Saucier, the mother of former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier who was charged with taking classified photos inside a submarine and sent to jail. Trump's idea to pardon Muhammad Ali is weird and beside the point Kathleen Saucier had submitted a pardon request under President Barack Obama, and resubmitted the application when Trump came into office. She told CNN that there was a breakthrough of sorts when she was interviewed by Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity. \u201cI remember someone sending me a text saying, \u2018Did you see President Trump talking about the kid on the submarine? Is that your son?\u2019\u201d Saucier said. Kristian Saucier was pardoned by Trump last year. The prospect of Trump wielding his pardon power in unconventional ways could have political implications. Weeks before Trump pardoned Arpaio, he was approached about a potential pardon for Michael Grimm, the former New York congressman who pleaded guilty to tax fraud in 2014. Grimm claimed during a debate this week that his opponent, Republican Rep. Dan Donovan, had privately asked Trump last year to pardon Grimm. The underlying suggestion was that it was a move to try to dissuade Grimm from running against Donovan. A source close to the Grimm campaign said Donovan personally told Grimm last summer that he had asked Trump to consider pardoning the ex-congressman, though Donovan did not explicitly suggest a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Donovan campaign denied that Donovan, who is endorsed by Trump, ever pushed the President to look at pardoning Grimm. Instead, the spokeswoman said, Donovan merely mentioned to Trump that another Republican figure from the Staten Island area would soon be reaching out to request a pardon for Grimm. A White House official said Grimm\u2019s claim \u201cdoesn\u2019t appear to be true\u201d and declined further comment.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has always been fixated with celebrity. Before he was President or even host of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the real estate mogul spent years working the New York City tabloids to catapult himself to fame. Since he took office, that hasn\u2019t changed. Trump elevated such people as reality show contestant Omarosa Manigault and WWE co-founder Linda McMahon to positions in his administration. And on Twitter, he often seems preoccupied with celebrities who are critical of him. Trump isn\u2019t the first celebrity to sit in the Oval Office. Ronald Reagan had a career in television and film before entering politics. Trump isn\u2019t the only President to schmooze with stars, either. Ronald and Nancy Reagan hosted countless celebrities at the White House, and Barack and Michelle Obama rubbed elbows with Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9. But although most presidents rely on celebrities to raise funds and influence young people, it seems like celebrities are the ones influencing Trump. Here\u2019s a look at three who recently helped influence the President\u2019s decisions. In April, Trump got a call from \u201cRocky\u201d actor Sylvester Stallone. Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon! \u201cSylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cOthers have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!\u201d Boxing legend Jack Johnson was convicted in 1913 of taking his white girlfriend across state lines for \u201cimmoral purposes\u201d under the White Slave Traffic Act, better known as the Mann Act. The law he was accused of violating was designed to protect white women from sex trafficking, but was later invoked to prosecute black men for relationships with white women, even if those relationships were consensual. Who was Jack Johnson, the boxer who Trump posthumously pardoned? The sentence destroyed Johnson\u2019s career and reputation. He died in 1946. Since 2004, Republican and Democratic lawmakers have periodically pushed for a pardon of Johnson but no President ever took up the case. About a month after Trump tweeted about his conversation with Stallone, he granted Johnson a full posthumous pardon. \u201cThis was very important to Sylvester Stallone, my friend for a long time, \u2018Sly\u2019 and the whole group,\u201d Trump said during the announcement in the Oval Office, with Stallone among those standing behind him. Trump was pretty clear: He felt Jackson\u2019s cause was worth his time and consideration because it was important to his high-profile friend. At the end of May, Kim Kardashian West stepped into the Oval Office for a meeting with the President. She was there to make the case for pardoning Alice Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who had been serving a life sentence in prison since 1996 for her involvement in a conspiracy to sell cocaine. It was Johnson\u2019s first conviction. Activists had been working on Johnson\u2019s behalf for years. In October, Kardashian West came across a video on her Twitter feed about the movement to free Johnson. She was immediately moved. \u201cI just felt this connection to her, like instantly,\u201d Kardashian West said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Van Jones. \u201cI wanted to help her. Why Kim Kardashian wanted President Trump to free me Kardashian West called Ivanka Trump and requested a meeting with the President. Over the next several months, she worked with a team of lawyers to build the case for pardoning Johnson and engaged in talks with Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner. After hearing her plea, Trump was sympathetic. He commuted Johnson\u2019s sentence. Kardashian West\u2019s success is different from Sylvester Stallone\u2019s in a notable way. It\u2019d be a stretch to call her a friend of the President. She endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and has voiced support for causes opposite to Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies. Some people criticized Kardashian West\u2019s meeting with Trump as an endorsement of the President. But she accomplished what she set out to do without causing much controversy, unlike her husband Kanye West. That Kardashian West was able to get through to Trump suggests that he has a desire to be liked by Hollywood\u2019s in-crowd. It also signaled that he\u2019s willing to reward stars who take a non-combative approach with him. Last week, former NBA star Dennis Rodman traveled to Singapore for the historic meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump. It was the first meeting between sitting leaders of both nations, and Rodman saw himself as instrumental to the talks. Though it\u2019s unusual for a retired pro basketball player who\u2019s also dabbled in movies and TV to involve himself in matters of foreign policy, Rodman has been working on his own unique brand of diplomacy with North Korea for several years. H\u00e4agen-Dazs, hotels and Dennis Rodman: Scenes from the US-North Korea summit He also might be the only person in the world who can claim a personal relationship with both Trump and Kim. Trump and Rodman know each other from Trump\u2019s reality TV days, when Rodman was twice a contestant on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d Rodman also endorsed Trump for president in 2016. Through his multiple visits to North Korea, Rodman has developed a friendship with Kim, an avid basketball fan. Though he\u2019s been sharply criticized for engaging with a leader accused of human rights abuses, Rodman has insisted that his visits show a willingness on Kim\u2019s part to negotiate with the US. If only a US leader would hear him out. Analysis: The case of the curiously compelling Dennis Rodman-Chris Cuomo interview In an emotional interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, Rodman said he tried appealing to Obama about Kim and got emotional recounting how the former President didn\u2019t take him seriously. With Trump, it seems he finally broke through. Though a US official said Rodman had no official role in the summit, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called to thank him on behalf of Trump. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much influence Rodman had on Trump\u2019s decision to meet with Kim. But it does seem that Trump has had a change of heart when it comes to the NBA star\u2019s approach to North Korea. Crazy Dennis Rodman is saying I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Never discussed, no interest, last place on Earth I want to go to. \u201cCrazy Dennis Rodman is saying I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Never discussed, no interest, last place on Earth I want to go to,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2014. But after becoming President, he adopted the same willingness to engage with the regime that Rodman has been advocating for years. Although Trump often seems to be acting on his own whims, some of these recent moves suggest the President can be swayed by star power.",

            "article_content": "The governor of Texas. A US congresswoman from Massachusetts. A US Senator from Delaware. These are just three of the offices LGBTQ candidates are hoping to assume this November in the midterm elections. Across the country, LGBTQ candidates are running in record numbers, mostly as Democrats but some as Republicans. Some are running to challenge state and local anti-LGBTQ policies. Others are running as a rebuke to President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. And in interviews with CNN, most candidates agreed that increased acceptance of the LGBTQ community has contributed to their ability run and said that visibility and representation are important. When Lupe Valdez, the Democratic nominee in the Texas\u2019 governor\u2019s race, first ran for Dallas County Sheriff in 2004, she sought the endorsement of the Latino Peace Officers Association. Making her pitch to the group, she says the head of the association told her, \u201cWe will never endorse a lesbian. You\u2019re going to shame us even though you\u2019re part of the Hispanic community.\u201d \u201cOf course, I thanked them and walked out to my car,\u201d Valdez told CNN. \u201cYou know, I teared up a little bit because being a lesbian is just part of who I am.\u201d This election cycle, Valdez is one of more than 400 LGBTQ candidates the Victory Institute has identified running for office this election cycle. The group, which identifies and trains potential LGBTQ candidates, says that\u2019s more LGBTQ candidates to run for office in an election year than ever before. According to the Institute\u2019s 2018 \u201cOut for America\u201d report, openly LGBTQ elected officials hold 559 positions nationwide. But in order to achieve equitable representation, the organization says the country would need to elect 22,827 more LGBTQ individuals nationwide. This year\u2019s pool includes several high-profile Democratic LGBTQ candidates: Chelsea Manning running for Senate in Maryland, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney running for New York Attorney General and Cynthia Nixon running for governor of New York. Valdez still won her election even after failing to snag the group\u2019s endorsement and served as Dallas County Sheriff for 13 years. After her victory, she recalled, she met a woman at the airport. \u201cHere comes this Anglo woman, obviously well-to-do, from another county, probably Republican, trying to tell me how excited she was about my election. As we talk in my mind I\u2019m thinking \u2013 What does this woman have in common with me?\u201d Valdez said. The woman said her son was at one point in the closet and depressed, and that she was once worried he would take his own life. Then the woman asked for a picture. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018I have to take a picture because my son will never believe that I sat next to you,\u2019\u201d Valdez said, tearing up. \u201cWhen she took the picture, she said your election validated my son.\u201d Alexandra Chandler, a Democrat running in a crowded House primary in Massachusetts, said that her decision to run in 2018 mirrored a common experience among female candidates running for public office: having to be asked multiple times by others before gathering the confidence to run. Chandler, a transgender woman, said a vow to serve her country after experiencing the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York City led her to work as an intelligence analyst until last year. In 2006, while she was still serving in the intelligence community, she decided to transition, fully expected to lose her job. She said during a town hall to discuss employee benefits, a colleague stood up and said, \u201cThis drag queen that\u2019s going to be in our bathrooms and all of this \u2013 this is disgusting. This person should be fired.\u201d Half of the auditorium, she says, applauded her colleague\u2019s statement. \u201cWhen I came out to my supervisors, I presumed I was going to be fired or it would be a process of me leaving quietly. But instead what happened instead was, even though it would have been within their rights to fire me, the chain of command \u2013 mostly conservative people who had never met a trans person before, knowingly at least \u2013 they stood by me,\u201d Chandler told CNN. \u201cThat just gives me a faith and optimism that I think people have responded to well in this campaign. People crave that. And it\u2019s not faith and optimism that\u2019s just words and talking points. It\u2019s grounded in real experience.\u201d Same-sex couple in SCOTUS cake case describes 'shock and disappointment' at ruling Chandler attributed the rise in LGBTQ candidates to \u201cself-defense combined with confidence.\u201d \u201cWhen one is under attack you can either crouch down, hide, despair. Or you can stand up and fight. For a lot of LGBT people, it\u2019s about standing up and fighting,\u201d she said. Christine Hallquist, a Democrat hoping to become Vermont\u2019s next governor, expressed similar sentiments. The former CEO of Vermont Electric Coop, who is running on a platform of environmental and economic justice, transitioned in 2015. \u201cI was sure I was going to lose my job. I was sure I was going to lose respect. But that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Hallquist said. \u201cSo this describes the beauty of Vermont. So now I\u2019m at this point where I can\u2019t do enough to give back to Vermont.\u201d Marriage is the least of LGBTQ+ issues at the start of Pride Month The Victory Institute, an organization with a sister political action committee called the Victory Fund, is geared toward encouraging more LGBTQ candidates to run for office. This election cycle, the fund, which requires candidates to identify as LGBTQ and be pro-choice in order to earn their endorsement, has endorsed 133 candidates. While the institute saw that LGBTQ politicians in office rose 24.8% overall since last year\u2019s annual \u201cOut for America\u201d report, the number of LGBTQ Republicans in office has shrunk at the same time. Nearly all the LGBTQ candidates CNN spoke with said they were inspired by the historic election of Virginia Democratic delegate Danica Roem, a transgender woman elected in 2017, who was open about her LGBTQ identity, but ran a platform focusing on the district\u2019s road problems. J.D. Ford, a Democrat running for Indiana\u2019s state Senate, said he sees the rise in LGBTQ candidates partially as a rebuke of state\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policies and the Trump administration. Ford faces incumbent Republican Mike Delph, who pushed a referendum on same-sex marriage in the state. \u201cI live in Indiana, so this is the home of Mike Pence. We\u2019re at the epicenter of all that,\u201d Ford said. \u201cGoing back to the past couple of years in Indiana, it\u2019s been very tumultuous for the LGBTQ+ community because of what I call legislative bullying,\u201d Ford added, referring to Delph\u2019s policy pushes and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed into law by Pence in 2015. Republican Gene Truono, a former PayPal executive running to replace Democratic US Sen. Tom Carper, says that despite the small pool of GOP LGBTQ candidates, he doesn\u2019t believe the disparity between Republicans and Democrats among the LGBTQ pool of candidates is necessarily a result of a rebuke of Republican or Trump administration policies. Among conservatives in his home state, Truono said his sexuality isn\u2019t commonly an issue. He recalled an evangelical pastor telling him on gay marriage: \u201cGene, as far as I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s a decided issue by the Supreme Court in 2015. I\u2019m more concerned where you stand on life, where you stand on religious freedom and liberty.\u201d However, Truono also said that though incidents are rare, he has not been immune to scrutiny for his sexuality since deciding to launch the campaign. He encountered one tense incident with some potential voters in West Sussex County. \u201cMost of the group seemed relatively receptive. There was one gentleman who threw some magazines with gay men on the cover and said, \u2018My religion teaches me this is a sin. I can\u2019t support someone like you,\u2019\u201d Truono said. GOP places hopes in diverse candidates to save them in their toughest midterm races \u201cI\u2019m not offended easily, so I just looked at him and said \u2018If that\u2019s how you feel then you\u2019ve obviously made up your mind, but I\u2019d appreciate if you\u2019d listen to where I stand on other issues,\u2019\u201d he added. Log Cabin Republicans\u2019 national office tells CNN that they\u2019ve identified six LGBTQ GOP candidates running for office in local and federal offices nationwide. Gregory Angelo, the president of Log Cabin Republicans, said that he sees that LGBTQ Republicans have viable races this year, with some of them running for reelection. \u201cThroughout America, you are seeing members of the LGBTQ community running for office as so much more than their sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d Angelo said, adding that over the course of his five years leading the organization, he has \u201cseen a trend of more LGBTQ Republicans running for office, not less.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Nine years ago, then-South Carolina Republican Gov. Mark Sanford\u2019s political career seemed to disappear along the Appalachian Trail. Sanford was able to resurrect his political life with a successful bid for Congress from South Carolina\u2019s First District, even after it was discovered that his trail trip was actually an extramarital affair in Argentina. On Tuesday, Sanford\u2019s career may go down the tubes again. Unlike nine years ago, when it took days to figure out that Sanford wasn\u2019t actually on the trail, it doesn\u2019t take days to determine why Sanford is in trouble in 2018. Sanford is learning a lesson that should be pretty clear by now: the Republican Party belongs to President Donald Trump, and most Republicans who go against him are endangering their political lives. Sanford has been vocal about the times he has disagreed with Trump. For instance, he supported Trump in 2016, but called on him to release his tax returns. Sanford said Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric was \u201ca problem\u201d in 2017. And when it came to actual legislation, only four out of 244 Republican House members have voted with the President less often than Sanford, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis. The disagreements between Sanford and Trump have been a focal point for Sanford\u2019s primary opponent Katie Arrington, and it seems to be working for her. Sanford\u2019s been spending money on television advertisements for the first time in five years. A recent survey from a local pollster (that does not call cell phones and does not meet CNN\u2019s standards) has Sanford leading Arrington, but the lead was within the margin of error. Sanford even gave out his own personal cell phone number for voters to call him. In other words, Sanford could win Tuesday, but it\u2019s also quite possible that he could lose. Sanford is hardly the first Republican member of Congress to have primary problems because of how he dealt with Trump. Republican Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, both critics of the President, dropped out of their respective primaries, in which, they were seen as insufficiently pro-Trump. Just last week, Alabama Republican Rep. Martha Roby was forced into a primary runoff, in large part because of blow back she is receiving for withdrawing her endorsement of Trump during the 2016 campaign. The problem that Trump\u2019s Republican adversaries are learning is that it\u2019s not 2016 anymore. Even as Trump was winning the presidential election, his net favorability (favorable-unfavorable) rating among Republicans in an average of polls was just +50 points. That\u2019s far short of the maximum +100 point rating. You could, in other words, oppose or critique Trump as a Republican (as Sanford did in 2016) and not get chased out of the party. Today, it\u2019s totally different. Trump\u2019s net favorability among Republicans is up to +71 percentage points on average. There are very few Republicans who disagree with Trump. Trump\u2019s approval rating (a slightly different measure than favorable rating) stands at 87% in the latest Gallup poll. To put that in perspective, only two other presidents since 1950 have had higher approval ratings among their own party heading into a potential presidential primary. The idea of a Republican opposing George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan (who had approval ratings among Republicans most similar to Trump) seems nutty on its face. There\u2019s a reason why both of them marched to renomination. The same idea seems to hold true for Trump. If there\u2019s any record of a candidate opposing Trump, it could be a problem for them in 2018. That\u2019s a lesson Sanford may learn all too well on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team has been probing Roger Stone\u2019s finances as it summons a series of witnesses to gather more information about one of President Donald Trump\u2019s longtime advisers, according to people familiar with the situation. Mueller\u2019s team has questioned associates about Stone\u2019s finances, including his tax returns. The special counsel recently subpoenaed John P. Kakanis, who has worked as Stone\u2019s assistant and has insight into some of Stone\u2019s business deals, according to a person familiar with the situation. Reuters first reported on the subpoena. Stone has insisted he played no role in colluding with Russians. Stone also said he has not been contacted by the special counsel\u2019s office. Roger Stone: I haven't been contacted by Mueller The interest in Stone\u2019s finances could be tied to Mueller\u2019s charge of investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion, though another possibility is Mueller is pursuing something unrelated that turned up in the course of the investigation. \u201cThe normal thing for a prosecutor in the course of your investigation is if you come across something that is itself worthy of criminal investigation, you don\u2019t turn a blind eye to it. You investigate,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin, a former assistant to Mueller. Whatever the reasoning, the probe into Stone\u2019s finances should give him cause for concern, Zeldin said. Stone appears to recognize that. \u201cThe special counsel having found no evidence or proof whatsoever of Russian collusion, trafficking in allegedly hacked emails with WikiLeaks or advance knowledge of the publication of (then-Clinton campaign chair John) Podesta\u2019s emails now seems to be combing through every molecule of my existence including my personal life, political activities and business affairs to conjure up some offense to charge me with either to silence me or induce me to testify against the President,\u201d Stone told CNN. \u201cI have no intention of being silenced or turning my back on President Trump.\u201d WSJ: Roger Stone tried to get information on Clinton from Assange The questions about Stone\u2019s finances have some of his allies claiming that Mueller has overstepped his mandate and is simply looking to take down one of the President\u2019s longtime allies. \u201cThey are trying to go after Roger\u2019s finances, to get another ridiculous indictment that has nothing to do with Russia,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign aide who worked with Stone on the early stages of Trump\u2019s presidential bid and has been questioned by Mueller\u2019s team as well as the grand jury. Nunberg pointed to the charges Mueller\u2019s team has brought against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for alleged financial crimes unrelated to his work on the Trump campaign. He also noted the raid on the home, office and hotel room of Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime personal attorney. The raid and related criminal investigation are being carried out by the Southern District of New York, but were referred there by Mueller\u2019s team. \u201cIf they want to continue to go after non-related financial matters where they\u2019re picking apart associates of the President, then by all means,\u201d Nunberg said. \u201cBecause they continue to delegitimize themselves and whatever they ultimately release in their findings.\u201d But Mueller\u2019s mandate when he was first appointed specifically gives him the authority to investigate \u201cany matters that arose or may arise\u201d directly from the Russia probe. So far, Mueller\u2019s team has contacted at least eight of Stone\u2019s current or former associates, Stone told NBC News on Sunday. He subsequently told CNN \u201cthey are all young people who have no knowledge about my personal, political or business activities.\u201d Roger Stone says he is 'prepared' for possibility of special counsel indictment Some of those names are still unknown, and Stone declined to provide them. In addition to subpoenaing Kakanis, Mueller\u2019s team subpoenaed Jason Sullivan, Stone\u2019s former social media adviser, to appear before the grand jury. \u201cJason has done nothing wrong and done everything right, and he\u2019s terrific at what he did,\u201d said Knut Johnson, Sullivan\u2019s lawyer. The special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment. A lawyer for Kakanis did not respond to requests for comment. The special counsel\u2019s office has already interviewed Nunberg and former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo. Both men were pressed for information regarding Stone in their interviews, according to people familiar with the questioning. Stone has come under public scrutiny, in part, because of a prescient prediction during the 2016 campaign. In a now-infamous tweet, Stone predicted trouble for Podesta, weeks before WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of Podesta\u2019s emails. Stone denies having any advance knowledge of the Podesta leaks. Stone said dinner with Assange was 'shtick' The US intelligence community concluded in January 2017 that Russian intelligence hacked the Democratic National Committee along with senior Democratic officials and provided the stolen material to WikiLeaks as part of Moscow\u2019s effort to damage Hillary Clinton and sway the election in favor of Trump. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied that the Russian government provided the hacked emails. \u201cI sleep well at night because I know what I have and have not done,\u201d Stone told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s no inappropriate activity pertaining to Russian collusion. I obtained nothing from WikiLeaks or Julian Assange. I never passed anything on to WikiLeaks or Julian Assange.\u201d As Mueller\u2019s team investigates Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential collusion between Trump associates and the Russian government, people familiar with the probe have expected Mueller to eventually bring charges related to the Russian hacking of the DNC and Democratic officials. A self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster,\u201d Stone cut his teeth in politics on Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign and made a career of political consulting and lobbying. Even after he officially parted ways with Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in its early days, Stone remained a staunch supporter and friend of Trump\u2019s. During the campaign, he launched a pro-Trump super PAC called Committee to Restore America\u2019s Greatness. Now, the interest in Stone\u2019s finances has created a new sense of alarm among his associates. \u201cThe special counsel is going to be woefully disappointed when they find out they have absolutely no proof and Roger Stone did not collude with Russians. But that will not stop them from creating a crime simply because he\u2019s close to the President of the United States,\u201d Caputo said in an interview. \u201cThis is a punishment strategy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In any other political environment, headlines about the President of the United States\u2019 alleged affair with a porn star and her bulldog attorney who is hellbent on publicizing the details would be radioactive for the President\u2019s party. But this isn\u2019t any other political environment. As Republicans awkwardly answer questions about Stormy Daniels\u2019 and the swirl of allegations against Trump, Democrats worry that a constant focus on the President\u2019s foibles through November will knock candidates off message, making it almost impossible for more policy focused messaging on health care, taxes and economic instability to break through the Trump messaging vortex. The latest chapter in the Daniels saga came when Michael Avenatti, the porn star\u2019s omnipresent attorney, on Monday filed a lawsuit alleging Trump defamed Daniels. The bipartisan concern has created a unique paradox: Republicans don\u2019t want to talk about the President\u2019s sex life and Democrats don\u2019t want it to dominate the conversation. \u201cAny good campaign adviser says there is nothing good about talking about s-e-x in public,\u201d quipped Jefrey Pollock, a pollster who is spearheading a project aimed at figuring out the best way Democrats can win over persuadable voters in the era of Trump. He added: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, though, it is not that Americans give the guy a pass on it at all. They are bothered by the notion that he is reckless. But largely that is focused on his time in office, as opposed to stuff that has happened out of office.\u201d Guy Cecil, the head of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, echoed that sentiment, arguing Democrats \u201cactually risk overusing Donald Trump as a way to encourage anti-Trump voters\u201d in November. \u201cI think our coverage is saturated with the Mueller investigation and everything that is adjacent to it,\u201d Cecil said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is much more to gain for Democratic politician to spend much of their time talking about these things.\u201d Cecil added that if candidates want the conversation to focus on issues \u201cthey have to talk about it in their town halls, talk about it in the press and buy it in their advertising.\u201d Daniels\u2019 story \u2013 that she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and was paid $130,000 in hush money by Michael Cohen, the President\u2019s lawyer, to stay silent weeks before the 2016 election \u2013 has had considerable staying power in a news cycle not known for longevity. Even though Trump has denied the allegations, the story has become pervasive, now helped with the expanding federal investigation into Cohen and Avenatti\u2019s public relations campaign. Seeing that phenomenon, operatives at the National Republican Congressional Committee have made preparing top-tier candidates for questions about Daniels and other Trump controversies a top priority as part of their media training, urging them to have an answer to the salacious questions before they face the press, according to a NRCC official. The official added that they are encouraging candidates to focus on local issues that move persuadable voters and that a focus on the President\u2019s sex life is not one of them. But there is also the pragmatic reason to stay away from the topic: It could easily catch candidates in a tough position. \u201cThere is a potential Todd Akin, Richard Murdoch problem,\u201d said Doug Heye, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee, referring to two candidates who made off-color comments about rape during the 2012 election. \u201cOne candidate could say the wrong thing that not only plays a big role in that race, but then becomes a question that every Republican candidate was asked in their race as well.\u201d So far, the results have been mixed. While many Republicans have dismissed the questions easily, a series of lawmakers and prospective officer holders have struggled to explain how they feel about the scandalous allegations about the President. The answers usually devolve into an awkward dance, where the Republicans seek to acknowledge the behavior isn\u2019t normal, but - at the same time - outline their wholehearted support for the President. Danny Tarkanian, a Republican running for Congress in Nevada who has sought to tie himself to the President, acknowledged this month that Trump \u201chas a different personality\u201d than most people and there are \u201csome things that you can question.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what Stormy Daniels is saying. It doesn\u2019t matter, you know, with all these other things that they can attack him on,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump has a different personality than I\u2019ve got. It wouldn\u2019t work for me; it probably wouldn\u2019t work for most of you.\u201d Republican Debbie Lesko, likewise, said earlier this month that President Trump \u201cneeds to address\u201d the allegations leveled by Daniels and they need to be \u201cinvestigated.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not the President, and I don\u2019t use his rhetoric and I certainly am not going to sexually harass anyone,\u201d she added at a debate with her then-Democratic opponent Hiral Tipirneni. The anti-Trump barb surprised local Democrats, especially given how Lesko had run with Trump for much of her campaign. But just as quickly as Lesko made the remarks, she walked it back. Speaking with the New York Times later, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a formal investigation by government or something like that. I just meant it needs to run its course.\u201d And then there is Rep. John Faso, who said he agrees with the sentiment that Trump is \u201coff the reservation in terms of the people he\u2019s been with\u201d when asked by a radio host who noted that the Republican was a \u201creligious man.\u201d When Faso tried to turn the conversation towards President Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, the host pushed back, and Faso demurred. \u201cI think these things may have happened before he became president they still don\u2019t make any of us proud,\u201d the New York Republican said. After he announced his plan to drop his reelection bid, Rep. Ryan Costello said that \u201cno matter how well you think you\u2019re doing at the job, that if the President says or does something that is off-color, your constituents want to hold you accountable for that.\u201d He added that the moment he does speak out against Trump, though, \u201cyou certainly run into the sawmill of the most strident pro-Trump voters in your district. So, you do get squeezed on both sides for sure.\u201d While Democrats are largely steering away from talking about Daniels, Andrew Bates, deputy communications director at American Bridge, a Democratic super PAC, said that the issue is putting pressure on Republicans whether or not the party focuses on it. \u201cMidterms are referendums on incumbent presidents and their party,\u201d said Bates. \u201cOn top of an extremely unpopular economic agenda that has sold out the American middle class, Republicans\u2019 handling of Trump\u2019s corruption and innumerable scandals - including his sexual misconduct - could make the difference at the margins in very difficult races for them.\u201d Bates said Democrats \u201cwill and should put taxes and healthcare front and center and hammer those issues endlessly\u201d but that issues like those raised by Daniels are \u201cadding fuel to voters\u2019 anger with Washington under Republican control\u201d with or without Democrats pushing the narrative.",

            "article_content": "Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s (R) decision on Monday to take on Sen. Bill Nelson (D) this November wasn\u2019t terribly unexpected. But, it is still very good news for a Republican Party desperate for some. Yes, there is the obvious fact that Scott running means that Nelson will face the most serious race since he won the Sunshine State Senate seat in 2000. Scott is a sitting two-term governor, and polls suggest that he and Nelson are running close; the Real Clear Politics poll of polls in the race shows Nelson with a small single-digit lead. The less obvious but more important impact of Scott\u2019s candidacy is that Democrats will now have to spend heavily \u2013 VERY heavily \u2013 to hold (or try to hold) the Florida seat. And that means less money for other potential races. Spending on Senate races is a zero-sum game \u2013 every dollar spent in Florida is a dollar less spent in, say, Arizona or Nevada or Tennessee. And, Democrats are going to have to spend a WHOLE lot of money in Florida. In that calculation, the most important thing to know about Scott is not his two terms as governor of Florida. It\u2019s his previous life as a health care executive in which he became very, very rich. In each of his gubernatorial races, Scott spent heavily from his personal fortune; he dropped $75 million in his 2010 victory and, after saying he wouldn\u2019t need to contribute any cash to his re-election, dumped almost $13 million in at the end of that 2014 race. Scott, as of 2017, was worth at least $150 million \u2013 making it likely he can spend a significant chunk of cash on his race against Nelson, in addition to the presumably large sum he can raise from pro-Trump donors around the country. (Scott has long been an ally of the President.) Senate Key Race alerts: Florida now a Toss-Up while Tennessee is Lean Republican How high might the price tag go for the Florida seat? In 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio got re-elected after promising to retire to run for president and then reconsidering when he lost that bid. Rubio spent north of $21 million while his Democratic opponent \u2013 then Rep. Patrick Murphy (D) \u2013 dropped $19 million. Third party spending \u2013 the vast majority of which was conservative groups savaging Murphy \u2013 totaled more than $46 million. Add it up and you\u2019ve got almost $86 million spent between the two major party candidates and their various affiliated outside groups. In Nelson\u2019s last re-election race in 2012, he spent $17 million while then-Rep. Connie Mack (R) raised and spent $7.5 million. Add that to the $23 million that outside groups spent and you have a total of $48 million. To my mind, the $86 million spent in 2016 is the floor for the Nelson-Scott race \u2013 particularly when you consider a) Scott\u2019s personal wealth and b) liberal donors\u2019 hatred for Scott. This race could easily top $100 million in total spending by both candidates, the party committees and super PACs.  Nelson, to his credit, is ready \u2013 knowing for quite some time that Scott was likely to challenge him. As of the end of 2017, Nelson had already raised $10 million for the race, with more than $8 million in the bank. But, given that Scott can simply stroke a check for $10 million, it\u2019s almost impossible for Nelson to keep pace. Which means national Democrats \u2013 whether in the form of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee or the super PAC world (or, likely, all of the above) will need to fill that gap in a major way. And, that could be a problem. Why? Because Senate Democrats have lots and lots of vulnerable incumbents up in November. There are 10 Democratic incumbents who hold seats that Trump won in 2016 \u2013 including five that he won by double digits. Defending all 10 of those incumbents was going to be a costly proposition before Scott\u2019s candidacy; it just got much more expensive. That\u2019s even before you consider any offensive opportunities for Democrats in Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and, a longer shot, Texas. Now, there are two mitigating factors: Still, Scott\u2019s candidacy will stretch Senate Democratic strategists in ways they would rather not be stretched. And every dollar that goes to defending Nelson from Scott\u2019s personal checkbook is a dollar not spent on some other race \u2013 whether on one of Nelson\u2019s Democratic colleagues or on a potential takeover chance. That\u2019s why Rick Scott really matters.",

            "article_content": "Today, voters in southwestern Pennsylvania will head to the polls to choose their new member of Congress. The fight between state Rep. Rick Saccone (R) and veteran Conor Lamb (D) was never expected to be close given that President Donald Trump won the 18th District by 20 points in 2016. But Saccone has struggled as a candidate and a fundraiser while  Lamb has shined. And Trump\u2019s struggles in his first year in office have emboldened Democrats in the district to use the special election as a way to send a message to the President. Polling conducted in the final days of the race suggest Lamb is the slight favorite to pull off an upset that would carry with it massive national implications. To better understand the race \u2013 and what it all means about and for Trump \u2013 I reached out to Jon Delano, the lead political analyst for Pittsburgh\u2019s KDKA, for his perspective. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Everyone agrees the race is close. No one agrees why. Is this mostly about Trump? Saccone? Lamb? Murphy? Delano: In a district that Donald Trump won by nearly 20 points and no Democrat has come close to winning in decades, it\u2019s undeniable, in my view, that this election is a referendum on the performance of President Trump. On the ground, it\u2019s been a coalition of anti-Trump groups, many that sprouted after Trump\u2019s election and led by women, that have been the volunteer backbone of the Lamb campaign. It is also true that Lamb has run a solid campaign, unifying Democrats, especially union Democrats, many of whom had backed the former Republican incumbent Tim Murphy, who often tossed votes to the trade unions. Saccone has a record in the state legislature of opposing organized labor on just about everything, and that has helped Lamb with many union members. But, fundamentally, as the President\u2019s visit to Pittsburgh on Saturday reinforced, if you like Trump, you vote Saccone, and if you don\u2019t, you back Lamb. Cillizza: Where did Lamb come from? This is a district where Democrats didn\u2019t even field a candidate against Murphy in 2014 or 2016. Delano: Conor Lamb comes from a Democratic political family with deep roots in Allegheny County politics. His grandfather was a state senator who served as majority leader when the Democrats controlled that body in the 1970s. Conor\u2019s uncle was elected twice as city controller in Pittsburgh. Conor\u2019s father worked in the Congress in the 1980s for US Rep. Austin Murphy, and is now a well-connected top government affairs officer for PNC, the nation\u2019s ninth largest bank. In short, Lamb has politics in his blood. Because there is no primary to pick nominees in special congressional elections, it\u2019s essentially an insider\u2019s game. Lamb\u2019s family connections and resume (assistant US Attorney & former Marine lawyer) with no record to hurt him positioned him to win on the second ballot among the 554 Democratic committee people in the four counties who voted. Ironically, in that vote, he positioned himself as slightly more liberal, defeating Westmoreland County commissioner Gina Cerilli who describes herself as a pro-life, pro-gun, and pro-union Democrat. As to why no Democrat challenged US Rep. Tim Murphy in 2014 and 2016, that\u2019s easy. Murphy was the hardest-working congressman this region has seen in a long time, attending every imaginable event (to the detriment of his home life) and positioning himself as a moderate-to-conservative representative on all the key issues. Cillizza: Did Republicans make a mistake in picking Saccone, an older longtime state legislator? Were there other possible candidates who could have been a better fit? Delano: Like the Democrats, the Republicans do not have a primary to select their nominee in a special congressional election. They use a conferee process whereby the Republican chairs of the four county parties pick individuals to vote for a nominee. On the first ballot, the 215 conferees split their votes with 75 for state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler, 74 for Saccone, and 66 for state Sen. Kim Ward. On the second ballot, Ward threw her support to Saccone, and he won handily. Ironically, Reschenthaler would have looked a lot more like Lamb.  An energetic, 34-year-old US Navy veteran who, like Lamb, had served as a military lawyer, Reschenthaler also, unlike Lamb, has legislative experience as a state senator. His loss to Saccone has created some bitterness in the GOP.  But with the party inclined to support the more pro-Trump candidate, Saccone \u2013 who told me over a year ago that he was Trump before Trump \u2013  was the obvious favorite. Privately, some Republican insiders say if the party had picked Reschenthaler, Lamb would have had no shot at winning. Who knows. Cillizza: National conservative groups have run a slew of ads trying to link Lamb to Nancy Pelosi. Do you see evidence it\u2019s working? Delano: It is true that many voters in western Pennsylvania do not like Nancy Pelosi. It is easy to characterize her as one of those \u201ccoastal liberals\u201d that seem to dominate the Democratic Party. But I don\u2019t see yet that the national Republican efforts to link Lamb to Pelosi is working. That\u2019s especially true since Lamb has been clear that he will not vote for Pelosi as leader. Of course, if he loses, the Pelosi connection will be validated in the eyes of some. In general, the outside PAC attack on Lamb has struck many as so over-the-edge as to be unbelievable. But, again, let\u2019s see who wins before we declare it was ineffective. Cillizza: \u201cFinish this sentence: \u201cIf Conor Lamb wins on Tuesday, it will tell us _____________ about the 2018 midterms.\u201d Now, explain. Delano: \u201cIf Conor Lamb wins on Tuesday, it will tell us that even in solid Trump country, the right kind of Democrat can win in the 2018 midterms.\u201d Of course, the President and Republicans will blame Saccone for the loss and distance themselves from the campaign. On Monday, Donald Trump Jr. told me that this election was NOT a referendum on his father\u2019s performance in the White House. But if Saccone wins, I suspect we will hear something different. While the old adage \u2013 all politics is local \u2013 is generally true, in my view, President Trump has nationalized the 2018 midterms. As a close observer here in western Pennsylvania, it\u2019s clear to me that the passion is on the side of the anti-Trump voters who intend to send a message by electing Conor Lamb. We will know shortly if that is enough to win.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has had no bigger international backer than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump\u2019s policies, particularly where it comes to moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing that city as Israel\u2019s capital \u2013 and also where it comes to drawing a hard line on Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 are in alignment with Netanyahu\u2019s. But there was a pall over their meeting Monday, since both men are beset by staffing issues, criminal issues, familial scandal and a skeptical press. Netanyahu's White House visit shrouded in scandal To help us break down the similarities \u2013 and differences \u2013 between Trump\u2019s problems and Netanyahu\u2019s problems, we have CNN\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent Oren Liebermann, who has written extensively about the Israeli Prime Minister. Here\u2019s a transcript of our exchange, edited slightly for flow. ZW: Oren, you published a story today with the headline \u201cThird Netanyahu confidant turns states\u2019 witness in graft probes.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound good for him. In Trump\u2019s case there is a special counsel working with former confidants of the US President. What\u2019s similar about Netanyahu\u2019s legal problems and what\u2019s different? OL: The biggest difference is in the substance of the investigations. They are fundamentally different types of proceedings. Mueller\u2019s special investigation began with Russian election meddling and has proceeded along those lines; the police investigations against Netanyahu and his inner circle began as graft probes. The end result may also be different, though that\u2019s unclear at this time. If convicted, Netanyahu will face a likely prison sentence, since these are criminal investigations. What happens if Mueller finds collusion between the Trump administration and Russia? What about obstruction of justice? Or perjury? We don\u2019t know the answer to those questions yet. But from those initial differences, there are many similarities. Both leaders\u2019 legal problems now involve members of their family and their inner circle. Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, is now a possible suspect in one of the corruption investigations facing the Israeli leader, just as Jared Kushner has become involved in the Russia investigation. Members of each leader\u2019s inner circle have also become a part of the investigations \u2013 Trump\u2019s confidants have been questioned by Mueller; Netanyahu\u2019s confidants have been named as suspects in the probes and have even turned state\u2019s witness. Netanyahu: How he rose to the top Both leaders have responded to the probes in much the same way \u2013 blaming the opposition, blasting the media, slamming leaks and repeatedly proclaiming innocence. Even their language has matched up \u2013 both have decried the investigations as media-fueled \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d There is also one other difference worth pointing out. Trump is in office until after the 2020 election. The political reality for Netanyahu is quite different. If his coalition partners turn on him, he could be out very quickly. ZW: A problem for Trump has been that his son-in-law apparently features in the Russia probe. And before the election, his son met with Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. Netanyahu\u2019s family has also been drawn into scandal. Are the circumstances similar and are they involved in the Israeli government? OL: Netanyahu\u2019s family isn\u2019t involved in politics the way Trump\u2019s family is involved. Though Netanyahu\u2019s wife is often by his side, she doesn\u2019t openly figure into the day-to-day operations of the Israeli government the way Trump\u2019s family does for the American government. Trump\u2019s daughter and his son-in-law have prominent, public roles in either the administration or the daily life of the President; Netanyahu\u2019s wife and children do not. Sure, Netanyahu\u2019s family makes headlines, but not nearly as often as Trump\u2019s family. That being said, just as Trump\u2019s family has become a focus of the Mueller investigation, Netanyahu\u2019s family has become embroiled in the graft probes. Sara Netanyahu is a possible suspect in one investigation, while her name features prominently in another. ZW: Netanyahu has long weighed in on US politics, particularly where it comes to Iran. He was a supporter of Mitt Romney in 2012 and, perhaps even more so, of Trump\u2019s in 2016. How important is his relationship with Trump to Netanyahu in Israel? OL: Incredibly important, and that\u2019s probably still an understatement. Israeli PM and wife questioned in Case 4000 Trump gave Netanyahu a series of diplomatic and political victories, from recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel to protecting Israel at the United Nations. Those were enormous scores for the Israeli leader, and he has tried to return the favor by repeatedly praising Trump and hailing the strongest ever ties between Israel and the US. More importantly, Trump is popular with Netanyahu\u2019s voter base and vice versa. Even if Trump was considered wild and unpredictable at first, he is firmly in the pro-Israel camp now, so it\u2019s in Netanyahu\u2019s interest to play up the strong ties between the two leaders. It\u2019s also worth remembering that this is the first time Netanyahu has had a Republican president. Up until now, it was either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama \u2013 Netanyahu entirely missed George W. Bush\u2019s time in office. ZW: How likely is it that Netanyahu survives this? OL: In Israeli politics, it\u2019s never wise to bet against Netanyahu. He knows how to play the game of Israeli politics better than anyone \u2026 and it is a brutal game. He\u2019s won four elections, and recent polling shows he would almost certainly win a fifth if elections were held today. He has the support of all of his coalition partners, which means he\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat. And yet each successive development in the corruption investigations of the Israeli leader is another blow to Netanyahu. Even if he has refused to back down, it becomes a little more difficult for his coalition partners to support him, and it becomes a political calculation of when to pull support. The closer the attorney general gets to possibly filing charges against Netanyahu, the harder it becomes to support him. So why haven\u2019t they already pulled their support? Because Israel\u2019s government is an entirely right-wing government, which means all the parties are pulling from generally the same voter base (with the exception of the ultra-Orthodox parties, who have their own voters). If one of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners pulls support for the Prime Minister, they may face a backlash from right-wing voters, upset that they toppled a right-wing government. That\u2019s why everyone is still supporting Netanyahu right now \u2013 not because it\u2019s in Netanyahu\u2019s interest, but because it\u2019s in their own. ZW: If, hypothetically, Netanyahu was forced out and his party lost power, what could it mean both for a Mideast peace process and also for the US and Iran? OL: Every Israeli party \u2013 left and right \u2013 would continue lobbying against Iran. Maybe not as vocally, maybe not as openly, but they\u2019re all on the same page when it comes to viewing Iran as a threat, so that doesn\u2019t change. Trump threatens to cut off aid to Palestinians On the Mideast peace process, it depends on who would step in. Because of the way Israeli politics works, it\u2019s entirely possible that, even if Netanyahu was forced out, his own party would simply find a different leader. In this case, the peace process is probably dead on arrival, since many in Netanyahu\u2019s own party are far more critical of a two-state solution than he is. If a centrist or left-wing party were able to win an election, then the peace process could still \u2013 theoretically, at least \u2013 proceed. But the peace process doesn\u2019t only rely on the Israeli government. Washington would still have to find some way to coax the Palestinians back to the table, as there aren\u2019t many (if any) Israeli politicians they believe will readily make concessions in a peace process. And Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, hasn\u2019t shown a willingness to make his own concessions for peace.",

            "article_content": "Kelli Ward, an anti-establishment conservative Republican running for the Senate in Arizona, told CNN she is \u201cnot opposed to increasing the age to purchase a firearm.\u201d That stance puts her in line not only with President Donald Trump, who\u2019s made a pitch to raise the age to 21, but also with Sen. Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican whom Ward sought to challenge until he announced his retirement last year. Flake has backed a Senate bill that would raise the minimum purchasing age. Ward is now facing Rep. Martha McSally and former Sheriff Joe Arpaio in the Republican primary for the open seat, with McSally enjoying favored status among the national GOP and its donor network. But Ward is working to establish herself as a palatable outsider alternative. Kelli Ward\u2019s DC charm offensive In the halls of the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington on Thursday, where an overwhelmingly pro-gun-rights crowd of activists had assembled, Ward outlined a moderate position on gun laws that is at odds with the National Rifle Association and an influential slice of the Republican base, who oppose raising the minimum age to buy a firearm. Asked whether she had considered the political risk of her stance, Ward dismissed it. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to get beyond political risk and actually start taking care of our kids and making sure they\u2019re safe at our schools, making sure that we\u2019re addressing those mental health issues that do exist,\u201d she said. Her record supporting the Second Amendment, she added, lends her unique credibility to take on the issue and back potential changes in policy. Trump: Adept teachers should carry guns \u201cI have an A+ rating with the NRA and I\u2019m a life member myself, and so if there\u2019s anybody that\u2019s going to be out there fighting for our state to maintain our Second Amendment rights, it\u2019s me, Dr. Kelli Ward,\u201d she said. Still, Ward\u2019s stance could set her up for a clash with the NRA \u2013 and possibly jeopardize support from the influential group during her difficult primary. In meetings this week with donors and conservative groups and interviews with national media, Ward sought \u201cto get the word out\u201d that she could be a viable, palatable candidate \u2013 not the \u201cChemtrail Kelli\u201d caricature that has been pushed by some national Republican groups. \u201cWe need to dispel that fake persona, that cartoon that John McCain and his supporters have attempted to create about me in the last election,\u201d Ward said. \u201cAnd people who are meeting me understand that I am competent, qualified, capable and ready to go to Washington and be the next US senator from the state of Arizona.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David A. Love is a writer and commentator based in Philadelphia. He contributes to publications including Atlanta Black Star, WHYY and Al Jazeera. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. Part of being a good and seasoned leader is knowing when to pass the baton to a new generation. If the Democrats want to remain relevant, dynamic and in tune with a changing America, Nancy Pelosi and other party leaders should pass the baton. And if they don\u2019t, they must learn to share power. With Pelosi positioning herself once again to become speaker of the House, questions remain as to whether she should assume this position. In a letter to their Democratic colleagues, 16 incoming and current members of Congress \u2013 mostly moderate and male \u2013 thanked Pelosi for her years of service but argued the time has come for new leadership in their caucus. \u201cWe promised to change the status quo, and we intend to deliver on that promise,\u201d they wrote, claiming their Democratic victory in the midterm elections came from candidates who said they would support new leadership in Congress. While there is little doubt that Pelosi is a capable leader who has raised millions of dollars for her caucus and was a guiding force behind the passage of Obamacare, she is not an example of future leadership. Certainly, she is not the future of the Democratic Party, which has just experienced its largest gains in Congress since Watergate. The 2019 House Democrats will be the most diverse they have ever been \u2013 with a record number of women, young women of color and LGBTQ people taking their seats following an election driven by a departure from politics as usual. But Pelosi is only part of the issue. The entire Democratic Party is in need of a leadership overhaul \u2013 one that incorporates individuals who reflect the diverse array of people and ideas that exist within it. If you have any doubt as to why, just take a look at where Democrat leaders have failed both to represent and defend core parts of their base. Black lawmakers slammed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for calling Rep. Maxine Waters \u201cnot American\u201d after she advocated for harassment of pro-Trump politicians and for remaining silent when Donald Trump attacked her. Nancy Pelosi should step aside Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, who has avoided the negative attacks Pelosi faces, was caught kneecapping a progressive congressional candidate and forcing him out of his race in support of moderate candidates. Hoyer defended his actions on the grounds that the party needs to support candidates who will win the general election in \u201ctough\u201d districts. And Democrats have failed to invest in races in the South. For years, the party supported Wall Street and lost touch with working people and the poor. Democrats embraced welfare reform and \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies that devastated marginalized communities, and financial deregulation that created more income inequality, eroded unions and paved the way for Trump. The Democrats have also ignored outreach to their base \u2013 including communities of color \u2013 opting instead to chase the elusive suburban soccer mom and field bland, unwinnable candidates with weak and stale messages. A postmortem of the 2016 election criticized the Democrats for, among other things, failing to prioritize fighting voter suppression, embrace social movements or expand and energize the base, turning off working-class voters with a hawkish stance, ignoring rural America and the youth-driven Bernie Sanders movement, and placing corporate profits over the needs of the public. Conventional wisdom dictated that only moderate white Democratic candidates \u2013 such as former senatorial candidates Michelle Nunn in Georgia, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Phil Bredesen in Tennessee could win in the South and Midwest. However, these candidates did not necessarily speak to or reflect the diversity of the party \u2013 particularly African-Americans, who consistently are reliable Democratic voters. Valerie Jarrett: Pelosi has the toughness Democrats need But 2019 presents a chance for a reset. The newly elected members of the House are not the usual suspects \u2013 they are everyday people whose presence demands new policies and threatens to upend the way Washington does business. Consider Lucy McBath, a progressive black woman activist who lost her son Jordan Davis to racialized vigilante gun violence, and defeated Rep. Karen Handel in the red Georgia 6th Congressional District. As a gun control advocate who forged a multiracial coalition, McBath offers badly needed perspectives and strategies for federal legislation to tackle the epidemic of gun proliferation. While she did not sign the letter calling for Pelosi\u2019s ouster, McBath is a movement leader whose life experience and knack for working with people warrants a position of influence in the new Congress. And it\u2019s not just McBath. Congress now has its first Native American members of Congress, and its first Muslim women members, including Somali-American and former refugee Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Palestinian-American Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Then there\u2019s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who unseated one of the most powerful House Democrats and now supports efforts to \u201cprimary\u201d out-of-touch Democratic incumbents. She participated in a sit-in in Pelosi\u2019s office to demand a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d which would wean the US economy off fossil fuels in a few decades. Although Ocasio-Cortez is supporting Pelosi for speaker \u2013 noting that all challenges to the leader are coming from her right, in an effort to steer the party in a more conservative, corporate-friendly direction \u2013 the freshman lawmaker should have opportunities to assume leadership roles.  For example, Rep. Ro Khanna of California said Pelosi should create a Green New Deal select committee and make Ocasio-Cortez the chair. \u201cPelosi should not only create this committee, but also appoint @Ocasio2018 as Chair,\u201d Khanna tweeted. \u201cThat is the boldness voters want. We need to shake up Congress & give the millennial generation a chance to lead. They have the most at stake re climate change.\u201d It would be wise for congressional Democrats to assess their leadership across the board, and channel the energy of millennials, women, black and brown activists coming to Washington. Bold, fresh ideas are crucial to fight the GOP assault on voting rights in the South and across the nation, and Trump\u2019s war on democracy and the rule of law. Democrats must follow the lead of the new blood in their ranks, and that includes incorporating new leadership while also learning from Pelosi and the old guard.",

Unfortunately, politicians in many states are trying to thwart that will, rejecting voter-backed election rules in an effort to aggrandize their power and keep themselves in office. We must put an end to these anti-democratic actions. Voters are justifiably upset at their elected leaders\u2019 complicity in the problems of gerrymandering, the increasing amount of money in politics, and voter suppression. Many electoral policies benefit current politicians, not the electorate as a whole. That\u2019s why people have risen up and taken on the issues themselves through local and statewide initiatives. But they have faced roadblocks at every step. Three reasons to (cautiously) celebrate Supreme Court on gerrymandering Over 4,000 volunteers in Michigan gathered more than 425,000 signatures from all 83 Michigan counties to put a measure on the ballot this fall to create an independent redistricting commission for the state. The voters, calling themselves Voters Not Politicians, quite literally seek to take redistricting away from the hands of self-interested politicians who draw lines to help their own chances at re-election. Yet groups like the Michigan Chamber of Commerce \u2013 which has backed Republican gerrymanders in the past \u2013 and Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette supported a lawsuit against the measure under the state constitution, seeking to kick it off the ballot. The Michigan Supreme Court ruled in favor of Voters Not Politicians, so the initiative will appear on this year\u2019s Michigan ballot as Proposal 2. But it was a close call: The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision was 4-3, with a vigorous dissent. Maine voters approved Ranked Choice Voting \u2013 an innovative electoral system in which voters can rank the candidates in order of preference \u2013 but after the Maine Supreme Court questioned its constitutionality, the state legislature repealed it for some elections and delayed it for others. The voters were forced to use a ballot initiative this June to reject the state legislature\u2019s action, approving Ranked Choice Voting once again. Supreme Court takes a giant step backward on voter rights Maine politicians are also attempting to thwart the voters\u2019 will regarding campaign finance. For years, Maine voters have supported public financing of campaigns, twice approving ballot initiatives on what they call Clean Elections. But this year Republican Gov. Paul LePage refused to release some of the public funds, until a court order required him to do so. And House Republicans are obstructing an attempt to fix a drafting error in a budget bill that puts the system in limbo for the upcoming election. The reason? These politicians simply don\u2019t like public financing, even though Maine voters support it. The story was the same in Tempe, Arizona, where earlier this year voters overwhelmingly approved a robust campaign finance disclosure law for city elections, which garnered an astonishing 91% of the vote. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey then signed a Republican-backed measure that prohibits localities in the state from enforcing local campaign finance rules, effectively gutting the Tempe measure. In South Dakota, voters in 2016 approved an initiative for a state statute to create a campaign finance voucher system, an innovative public financing method in which every voter in the state can donate public money to the candidate of their choice. The legislature overruled it with a new statute to repeal the measure. Sotomayor is raising her voice for what's right North Carolina Republicans are engaged in a brazen effort to limit the information provided to voters on ballot initiatives this year. Normally, a bipartisan panel writes short summary captions to appear alongside proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot, but the GOP wants to remove this panel\u2019s authority to write the captions. The North Carolina ballot this year will include questions on a new strict voter ID rule and an amendment that would strip the authority of the governor \u2013 currently Democrat Roy Cooper \u2013 from filling vacancies on state courts and making appointments to the state election board. It should surprise no one, given the Republicans\u2019 current efforts, that the bipartisan panel this year includes two Democrats and only one Republican. The Republicans\u2019 answer is to give voters less information about what is on the ballot. Why are these elected officials so afraid of the voters? Perhaps it\u2019s because voters of all political beliefs are tired of how entrenched politicians try to game the system to help their side. They are afraid the voters will reject them at the ballot box, so they seek to rig the rules to give them a better shot at re-election. Yet even among all this gamesmanship, voters still have a powerful tool to combat these overreaches: the November ballot.  First, voters can enact pro-democracy reforms in many states. This November, voters in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri and Utah will decide whether to create redistricting commissions for their states, taking the power to draw lines away from self-interested politicians and making the process fairer and more independent. Ohio voters already approved a redistricting commission earlier this year. This is the most voter activity on redistricting in years. The Missouri initiative also includes robust campaign finance reform. Voters in both North Dakota and South Dakota will also see ballot measures on state constitutional amendments \u2014 which the legislatures can\u2019t unilaterally overrule \u2014 to impose campaign finance and ethics reforms. Arizona voters may also consider a ballot initiative on campaign finance if enough of the submitted signatures are valid. Florida voters will determine whether to fix the state\u2019s worst-in-the-nation felon disenfranchisement law, which takes away the right to vote for life for more than 1.5 million Floridians. Voters in Maryland and Nevada will decide if they should modernize their voter registration systems and adopt Election Day registration (in Maryland) or automatic voter registration (in Nevada). Second, we can \u201cthrow the bums out.\u201d Voters should consider these structural election issues when making their voting choices. Politicians should be responsive to the public will, and if they are not, then we should find different politicians who will espouse pro-democracy views. Yes, gerrymandered districts, the large influence of money in politics, and voter suppression tactics make this ideal harder than ever. That just means we must double down in our effort to make a difference at the ballot box. That includes not only voting for Congress but also being informed and voting on state and local politicians and ballot measures. It also requires increased turnout. We won\u2019t see positive change by sitting on the sidelines. This is our democracy. It\u2019s high time we make sure our politicians remember it.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. Confronted with a true alpha male in Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump \u2013 who likes to talk tough \u2013 turned into a fawning beta in Helsinki, Finland, abandoning American interests in favor of appeasing the man who allegedly attacked the integrity of the 2016 presidential election. Though Vice President Mike Pence praised the President\u2019s performance, saying Trump \u201cstands without apology as the leader of the free world,\u201d his analysis could not have been further from the truth. It was, as Sen. John McCain observed, \u201cone of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u201d McCain added that, \u201cNo prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant.\u201d Trump's zero preparation, zero achievement summit Unique as it was for a president to show such weakness, Trump\u2019s display of cowardice was wholly consistent with a man who believed his military high school was equal to true service in the armed forces and who declared his sexual experiences during the HIV/AIDS crisis tantamount to duty in the Vietnam War. Anyone who expects anything different hasn\u2019t been paying attention to how Trump behaves when face-to-face with strong individuals. He likes to talk a big game, but when he\u2019s dealing with anyone he deems of importance, he\u2019s prone to appeasement and capitulation. Recall Trump in the days after racists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, where police said one of them killed an innocent woman by ramming his car into a crowd on a city street.  Unable to muster the moral fortitude to condemn the fringe elements of his political base, Trump repeatedly said \u201cboth sides\u201d were to blame for the tragedy that unfolded. Of course, the reality is rather different: One side marched with tiki torches, shouting racist chants. The other challenged the hate with calls for tolerance. The sides were not equal, and it was a peace activist who lost her life. Trump is no longer leader of the free world After caving in Charlottesville, Trump was met with demands from the Parkland student activists, who wanted answers and action after living through a tragic mass shooting. Face-to-face with students who meant business, he briefly abandoned his strict pro-gun position and pledged to work for sensible gun control. He even noted how some lawmakers are captive to the National Rifle Association. Days later, after his own meeting with the NRA, he knuckled under, lost the courage of his convictions and abandoned both the kids and his promise. As weak as he is at home, Trump is even weaker with foreign leaders. Do you recall how the President mocked North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and promised a \u201cfire and fury\u201d response to any future provocations with rockets or nuclear tests? Trump then proceeded to court Kim for a so-called summit in Singapore. There he gave the dictator the legitimacy he craved and promised to cut back on American military exercises in the region. What did America get in return? He\u2019d argue the return of hostages and no missiles fired, but there remains to be any real steps taken toward denuclearization. Trump isn\u2019t much braver when he picks fights with world leaders who wish America no harm. He used an interview with the British tabloid The Sun to bash Prime Minister Theresa May, and boost her rival Boris Johnson, but when in the same room with her, he backed down.  With a familiar cry of \u201cfake news,\u201d the President humiliated himself by retreating in the Prime Minister\u2019s presence. How long can his war Cabinet tolerate Trump's farce? As profiles in cowardice go, however, nothing Trump has done is as bad as his treatment of Putin. With the indictments of Russian agents piling up, Trump prefaced his session in Helsinki by tweeting \u201cto build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past \u2013 as the world\u2019s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! #HELSINKI2018\u201d  As the injured party in the 2016 election attack, America should demand accountability, not normalcy, but Trump\u2019s words echoed with the sound of guilt. What Trump actually cares about is the shadow that the Russian hackers cast over the election that saw him become president. He made this clear by repeatedly telling the press in Helsinki there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between his campaign and Moscow. He pitifully pointed to his Electoral College victory and talked about his long-vanquished rival, Hillary Clinton. (Ignoring the fact that she won the popular vote, he said, \u201cI beat Hillary Clinton easily and, frankly, we beat her,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won that race, and it\u2019s a shame that there can even be a little bit of a cloud over it.\u201d) Trump is so afraid of the truth about that little cloud that he essentially said he believed Putin instead of his own intelligence agencies, which have repeatedly declared the Russians did it. \u201cThey think it\u2019s Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cI have President Putin \u2013 he just said it\u2019s not Russia. I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be.\u201d Trump welcomed Putin\u2019s offer, made with a crocodile smile, to help investigate the election trouble.  As much as Trump spoke like a leader over-eager to please, his body language suggested a cowering respect for Putin as the kind of manly man Trump wishes he could be. Putin rarely smiled and, when Trump praised him for the successful World Cup tournament, he barely acknowledged the compliment.  When asked directly about whether the Russian state possessed compromising information about Trump \u2013 kompromat is the term of art \u2013 Putin wouldn\u2019t explicitly say \u201cno.\u201d With his equivocating on krompromat, Putin made sure Trump will feel insecure and weak as he contemplates the future.  It was a brilliant bit of gamesmanship, but then again, the world didn\u2019t need any more evidence of Trump\u2019s insecurity and weakness.",

He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Mark Sanford survived cheating on his wife, but he could not survive cheating on Donald Trump. The South Carolina Congressman lost his primary on June 12 after a long career in politics in which he had never previously lost a race. And this despite the bizarre episode in 2009 in which his office, attempting to cover up an affair, said he was \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail\u201d when Sanford, then governor of South Carolina, was really in Argentina with his mistress. Sanford never resigned the governorship, won election to Congress in 2013 and didn\u2019t even face a general election challenger in 2014. In 2016, Sanford won a primary before winning easily in the fall. Then Trump came into his life, and all hell broke loose. Sanford became one of the President\u2019s most vocal critics, hammering Trump from the beginning of the chief executive\u2019s term. While Sanford\u2019s anti-Trump rhetoric gets most of the blame for his primary loss, the real meat of it can be found in Sanford\u2019s voting record. According to an analysis of congressional voting records done by the site 538, only four members of the House Republican conference voted less frequently with Trump than Sanford did. Based on the election results in 2016, the analysis predicted Sanford to vote with Trump 87% the time, when in fact he only voted with Trump 73% of time (very low compared to the rest of his colleagues, who voted with Trump over 90% of the time). Democrats need to stop believing this myth about Trump's base However, this wasn\u2019t a general election. This was a GOP primary, and Republicans are solidly unified behind Trump and his agenda. At the 500-day mark of his presidency, Axios judges Trump to have the highest \u201cown party\u201d support of any president not named George W. Bush after 9-11. There\u2019s room in the party for people to have stylistic differences with the President. It\u2019s hard to imagine, for instance, people more personally dissimilar than Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But Republican voters expect them to be unified on policy, and they certainly are (McConnell votes with Trump 96% of the time). But this wasn\u2019t an issue of style. By straying from the President\u2019s agenda, Sanford signaled to the Republicans in his district that he was not interested in representing their views or in helping the GOP achieve results through unity. When you have a president of your party, he or she sets the policy agenda. When you get out of step with that, you are on the chopping block. Let\u2019s look at another primary from Tuesday night in Virginia, where incumbent Congressman Scott Taylor in the 10th District faced a pro-Trump challenger who argued that Taylor was not sufficiently loyal to the President. Why Trump and the GOP are gaining In this case, Taylor had voted with Trump nearly 99% of the time. He won 76% of the vote in the primary, an easy win. Taylor had expressed discomfort with Trump stylistically (he once said Trump needed to be more \u201ccareful with his words\u201d) but on policy he unfailingly voted Trump\u2019s position. Taylor was a team player when it mattered. Sanford was not. Republicans want unity in the party because they believe in the Trump agenda, and they realize that politics is a team sport. They aren\u2019t interested in people giving lip service to conservative Republican values at home while voting to spoil Trump\u2019s broth in Washington. Primary voter tolerance for infighting among Republicans has waned under Trump because people realize that teamwork produces results. They like conservative judges, a strong national defense, lower taxes and the cracking economy \u2013 all things made possible by Republicans sticking together to produce policy wins. In CNN\u2019s May survey, 64% of Republicans said they had more confidence in Trump to handle the issues of the day versus just 26% who said Republicans in Congress.  Sanford\u2019s loss should be a wake-up call for Republican members of Congress who find themselves out of step with the Trump policy agenda. Voters will forgive lots of things \u2013 even affairs and prickliness, as Sanford learned \u2013 but they will not tolerate an interruption of the progress being made under unified Republican control in Washington. Republicans have no interest in going back to the policy incrementalism of the past. The Mark Sanford\u2019s of the world learned last night that when you vote against the Trump agenda, Republican voters in your district might just tell you to take (another) hike.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. On February 27, 2015, prominent Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was gunned down on a bridge in Moscow next to the Kremlin. On the third anniversary of his assassination, his life and legacy will be memorialized in our nation\u2019s capital. Tuesday, the city of Washington, D.C., will formally designate the block in front of the Russian Embassy on Wisconsin Avenue as \u201cBoris Nemtsov Plaza.\u201d This will be the first permanent tribute in the world to the slain Russian statesman who dedicated his life to the cause of freedom. Last February, on the second anniversary of his murder, I made a commitment in the U.S. Senate to ensure that Nemtsov\u2019s legacy is never forgotten. Inspired by a law passed by Congress in the 1980s to name the block outside of the then-Soviet Embassy on 16th Street \u201cAndrei Sakharov Plaza\u201d in honor of the great Russian dissident, I introduced legislation to do the same for Boris Nemtsov on the street in front of the Russian Embassy. Although the Nemtsov bill received strong bipartisan support from Sens. Chris Coons, D-Delaware; John McCain, R-Arizona; Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, and other lawmakers, the legislation stalled in Congress. But thanks to extraordinary efforts by D.C. City Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Councilmember Mary Cheh, Russian pro-democracy advocate and Nemtsov\u2019s longtime colleague Vladimir Kara-Murza and many others, the street will bear Boris Nemtsov\u2019s name this week. It will serve as a permanent reminder to the Russian people that these dissident voices live on and the defenders of liberty will not be silenced. In life, Boris Nemtsov dedicated himself to the vision of a free and democratic Russia. After earning a doctorate in physics from the State University of Gorky in 1985, he became politically active in the early days of perestroika, leading the movement to successfully halt the construction of a local nuclear reactor after the Chernobyl disaster. In 1990, Nemtsov was elected to the Soviet Congress of People\u2019s Deputies. In 1991, the year of the Soviet Union\u2019s fall, Nemtsov was appointed as a regional governor in Russia, and became Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister in the late 1990s. He made a name for himself pushing an ambitious agenda of market reform and economic modernization, and also for leading a large grassroots movement against the First Chechen War. He was, for a time, arguably Russia\u2019s most popular politician and was widely viewed as a likely successor to President Boris Yeltsin. What's in a name? In global affairs, street signs can be political irritants In the 2000s, Nemtsov emerged as a major critic of President Vladimir Putin and worked to unite the opposition amid Putin\u2019s efforts to roll back democratic reforms and consolidate power. His work to fight government corruption, organize mass protest demonstrations, and speak out against the Putin regime\u2019s invasion of Ukraine ended with his assassination. A Russian court said that Nemtsov\u2019s convicted killers were offered a bounty of 15 million rubles ($253,889.59). While Americans today are increasingly focused on stopping Putin\u2019s ongoing attempts to interfere with our democracy, we cannot forget that domestic repression in Russia is worsening. With the Russian presidential elections being held next month, the Putin regime is increasing its political oppression to ensure the outcome of the election before a single ballot is cast. Putin has prevented serious challengers \u2013 including anti-corruption activist and opposition leader, Alexei Navalny \u2013 from running against him in the election. Navalny was deemed ineligible to run for office due to a prior conviction on what are widely viewed as false and politically-motivated charges. On January 28, thousands of Russians across the country protested the upcoming elections, calling for a boycott that Navalny has dubbed a \u201cvoters\u2019 strike.\u201d The Putin regime has also increased suppression of independent voices in the media and online as well as continued to crack down on civil society and non-governmental organizations operating in Russia. Russian citizens reportedly have been threatened for indicating on social media their intention to participate in protests. In Putin\u2019s Russia, planning to exercise fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression or assembly warrants official harassment.  As young Russians continue to take to the streets to peacefully protest their government, many of them look to America for moral support for their cause. Boris Nemtsov Plaza is an important signal of American support. In death, Boris Nemtsov has become a symbol of the Russian people\u2019s aspirations for a truly democratic government that is free, open, and transparent. It is my hope that one day the Russian people will have leaders who protect the fundamental freedoms of all their citizens, and are proud to have Boris Nemtsov\u2019s name outside of their embassy in Washington. Until that day comes, I will continue standing with those in Russia fighting for a better future \u2013 a future like the one envisioned by the late Boris Nemtsov.",

I certainly don\u2019t regret my vote; didn\u2019t have any other option to fix what needed fixing in the US.\u201d Certain I couldn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d Mike to my liking, I didn\u2019t bother replying.  Jim took a different tack, questioning both my party and religious affiliations. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you are Jewish and didn\u2019t vote for Trump,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo Democrat in recent history has stood up for Israel, and possibly no other president has embraced the Jewish people as Trump has. You are a beautiful lady, clever \u2026 and well educated but I think you are missing what is really important.\u201d How to date in 2018 While strongly disagreeing, I wasn\u2019t interested in debating Jim or pointing out that the Pew Research Center\u2019s exit polling for the 2016 presidential election showed 71% of Jewish respondents said they voted for Hillary Clinton. Instead, I deleted Jim. And then there was Brad. After several engaging emails back and forth, coffee seemed like a good idea. It was, until one cup in. Our conversation turned to politics, a safe zone, I assumed, since my profile made my position explicitly clear. That\u2019s when Brad confessed to simply ignoring my deal breaker and preceded to tell me all the reasons Clinton couldn\u2019t possibly make America great again. What followed wasn\u2019t pretty, as I passionately pointed out that my candidate never grabbed a woman by the you know what and bragged about it. I then angrily swept out the door, leaving my date sitting solo with my lukewarm latte. Thirty years ago, I don\u2019t recall ever asking my date whom he voted for or even what party he supported. Yet today, I proudly wear a pink pussy hat, and a casual coffee date with a Trumpster nearly comes to blows. Where once age, religion and geography were dating criteria I considered, it\u2019s now politics that\u2019s most polarizing. I\u2019m not only asking whom someone voted for, but also disqualifying that individual based on his answer. Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option The most divisive presidential campaign in my lifetime followed by one year of a Trump presidency has led me to this point. Simply put, principles and values trump tolerance. I\u2019m not alone. Last February, dating site Match.com reported a decrease in activity among its liberal users, and approximately 60% of liberals responded that they were less likely to date a conservative than they would have been two years prior. However, despite my staunch stand, the tide may be turning. Match\u2019s eighth annual survey of more than 5,000 single people released this February shows 72% of people would date someone affiliated with a different party \u2013 just not me, if that someone supported Trump. \u201cWhy is it OK for you to label me?\u201d pointedly asked Doug, another e-suitor who reached out. \u201cYou\u2019re judging people before you even meet them. That\u2019s just as divisive as dismissing the man you can\u2019t stand,\u201d he added.  Sadly, I realized that Doug, and the 72% of Match\u2019s respondents, had a point. I value tolerance. I respect alternative points of view, too, and welcome constructive debate and discussion. I have friends with varying viewpoints and work well with individuals across the political spectrum.  But I fundamentally believe in the principles of liberty, equality, justice and diversity. It is these democratic ideals and the institutions that represent them that Trump continuously attacks. It\u2019s why, for me, a vote for Trump signals a fundamental difference in core values, a difference I can\u2019t disregard or move past when looking for love. It is the reason I swipe left. In today\u2019s politically charged world, opposites no longer always attract, and love can\u2019t conquer all. And while I wonder if this new measure of compatibility inhibits our pursuit of a more perfect union, here\u2019s hoping it could just lead to mine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Cornell William Brooks is a former president and CEO of the NAACP. He is a visiting professor of Ethics, Law and Justice Movements at Boston University School of Law and School of Theology and a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. From pulpits and podiums across the country, Americans will be reminded on Monday of the relevance of Dr. Martin Luther King\u2019s message in 2018. Some time ago, during my tenure as president and CEO of the NAACP, I was painfully reminded of the timeliness of Dr. King in a setting he might not have dreamed of, during a conversation he might have not imagined. During a reception for supporters of civil rights, I looked around a penthouse apartment filled with beautiful art, owned by black owners dressed even more impeccably than their decor. The room was filled with well-pedigreed African Americans with impressive resum\u00e9s. And it was against this backdrop that I gave a short talk on the importance of the right to vote and the battle against voter suppression. Upon finished my fundraising homily, a well-to-do business leader said to me, quite sincerely: \u201cVoting rights are fine, but our people need economic justice. Were Martin Luther King, Jr. alive today, he would be talking about economic justice, jobs and business. How hard is it to vote, anyway?\u201d But he was sadly mistaken \u2013 these two issues are inextricably linked. In the more than half century since Dr. King battled these two issues, the need to address poverty and income inequality through a pro-democracy campaign that eliminates voter suppression remains critical. In 2018, many Americans find it as hard to vote as they do to make a living. During the 2016 presidential campaign there were 15 states, including states that are usually critical battlegrounds like Virginia, Ohio and Wisconsin, with strict voter ID laws that suppressed the votes of often poor and minority prospective voters without a required ID. Dr. King\u2019s work suggests this year is the time for both a cutting-edge economic justice movement and radical pro-democracy movement that collectively protects and expands voting rights. Voting can't be use it or lose it Many Americans remember, in 2015, when Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, and President Barack Obama walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on the 50th anniversary of the march from Selma to Montgomery \u2013 a march that culminated in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And, in August 2018, many Americans will commemorate the unfinished Poor People\u2019s Campaign of 1968, in which Dr. King planned to occupy Washington D.C. in a tent city to seek economic justice. Dr. King did not live to complete the Poor People\u2019s Campaign because he was assassinated in Memphis while supporting a strike for economic justice on behalf of sanitation workers. The issue is not merely the number of people who exist in what Dr. King called an \u201cairtight cage of poverty\u201d but also the growing number of people living on gilded pedestals of massive wealth. Over a little more than a generation, the bottom half of wage earners saw their share of America\u2019s wealth shrink, while those in the top half of wage earners saw their share enviably expand. Five ways you can be a better American than the President In 1980, the bottom half of Americans earned a fifth of the nation\u2019s income, twice as much as the top 1%. Today, however, an affluent 1%  bring home over 20% of America\u2019s income, while the bottom half earns just 13% \u2013 giving economic credence to those who know intuitively that \u201cthe rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\u201d The richest 1% the nation\u2019s families control a record-setting 38.6% of America\u2019s wealth, nearly double the wealth of the bottom 90%. These numbers represent parents who silently admit to themselves what they dare not say aloud to their children: the future is dimmer for the next generation.  This is disproportionately true for poor people of color \u2013 as well as white working-class Trump voters. While Trump voters and voters of color may be disproportionately affected by income inequality, only African Americans have had their votes suppressed with \u201calmost surgical precision,\u201d according to one federal appeals court. Since the legally wrong-headed and morally wrong-hearted Supreme Court decision Shelby v. Holder, a large majority of states have enacted or attempted to enact discriminatory voting restrictions: strict ID laws, closing polls, limiting the time to register and/or vote and purging of voter rolls. What Trump doesn't get about Martin Luther King Jr. Moreover, the criminal justice system also disenfranchises voters. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, where I am a senior fellow, more than 6 million of our fellow citizens can\u2019t vote because they have a criminal conviction, so much so that one in every 13 voting-age African Americans lacks the ability to vote. Income inequality and voter suppression are not separate challenges to our democracy. Voter suppression is how monied interests perpetuate income inequality. Voter suppression also prevents the reforms that create equality. For example, the recently passed Trump tax cuts are regarded by economists as representing a wealth transfer to the richest Americans. This tax cut was enacted while pro-economic justice reforms have stalled in Congress. These reforms include: infrastructure investments to revitalize poor communities, student loan reform to lighten debt loads and legislative change to make it easier for those with criminal records to work.  Having risked his life to secure voting rights and having lost his life seeking economic justice, Dr. King\u2019s celebrated dream must inspire a pro-democracy movement in 2018 that radically expands voting rights to secure economic opportunity. Such a movement must include automatic registration, election modernization, campaign finance reform and felony re-enfranchisement \u2013 to empower Americans to vote for economic justice reform. To get policies that grow wages and jobs, you need votes \u2013 and a movement.",

Sherrod Brown said the US needs to reopen discussions with Mexico and Canada on trade, rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s contention that their new trade agreement is final. \u201cThe work is not done yet,\u201d Brown said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cI understand the President said it\u2019s final. The President needs to talk to Congress on this.

Brown, a critic of NAFTA, said he wanted the new agreement to have stronger labor standards and protections against outsourcing. Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and just-departed Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto signed the NAFTA replacement at a ceremony during the recernt G20 summit. Aboard Air Force One after the G20, Trump told reporters he would be \u201cformally terminating NAFTA shortly\u201d and sending the USMCA to Congress for approval. \u201cCongress will have a choice of the USMCA or pre-NAFTA,\u201d Trump said. In Sunday\u2019s interview, Brown dismissed Trump\u2019s ultimatum, insisting a deal more to his liking could still be reached. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do this right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe President\u2019s threats are not particularly helpful, not surprisingly, but we need stronger labor enforcement standards.\u201d Brown is a pro-labor Democrat who recently won re-election in a state Trump carried in 2016, and since his re-election, he has not written off the possibility he will challenge Trump in 2020. He told CNN on Sunday that he still did not know whether he would run, but made the case that his message would be a strong one nationwide. \u201cIt\u2019s the respect and dignity of work matters for this country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd both parties, frankly, have not paid \u2013 neither party has paid enough attention to that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t doing much to bolster White House assurances that he\u2019s got nothing to worry about from Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, after a series of potentially ominous turns in the Russia investigation. The President\u2019s recent barrage of tweets and comments and testimony from sources close to him \u2013 coinciding with thickening intrigue around the special counsel \u2013 hint instead at deep concern on Trump\u2019s part. \u201cWhile the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way, at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief. This is our Joseph McCarthy Era!\u201d Trump tweeted Wednesday, a day after blasting the special counsel as a \u201cconflicted prosecutor gone rogue.\u201d Despite this outburst of fury, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders painted a portrait of a President who was serenely awaiting Mueller\u2019s findings. \u201cI don\u2019t think the President has any concerns about the report because he knows that there was no wrongdoing by him and that there was no collusion,\u201d Sanders told reporters at her first daily briefing in a month. The explanation for Trump\u2019s angst over his predicament seems to lie in a flurry of startling and potentially significant developments and reports swirling around his jailed ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and other associates. Giuliani: Trump 'upset for weeks' over Mueller squeezing Manafort Trump, the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss, is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril. He has no choice but to watch as Mueller, an adversary whose discreet public profile makes him an elusive target, grinds away, apparently getting ever closer to Trump\u2019s inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself. \u201cThe Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on,\u201d Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless, unseen foe. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash the President had been \u201cupset for weeks\u201d about \u201cthe un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.\u201d Manafort denies ever meeting with Assange While the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016, a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity. In the space of a few days, it emerged that Manafort\u2019s cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions. The Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton, on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report \u2013 Manafort called it \u201ctotally false and deliberately libelous\u201d and Wikileaks was \u201cwilling to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor\u2019s head that Manafort never met Assange.\u201d The paper\u2019s sourcing was also vague, making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting. So for now, joining the dots cannot produce definitive conclusions. CNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative, Jerome Corsi, as a go between. In another development, CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller\u2019s team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting, according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter. Such is the secrecy around Mueller\u2019s investigation that no one outside knows what he knows. The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice. If there is such supporting evidence, it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump. But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election. In his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort, for instance, Mueller\u2019s team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied \u201con a variety of subject matters\u201d \u2013 a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge. There was immediate speculation that Manafort\u2019s apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President. The White House said there had been no talk of such a step. But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon, Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact. This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller\u2019s progress, another factor that might explain his recent anger. The New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort\u2019s lawyers. Stone's efforts to seek WikiLeaks documents detailed in draft Mueller document Former Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary. \u201cWhat in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange\u2019s role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking?\u201d Ben-Veniste said. It was not clear whether Manafort\u2019s alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange. But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy, he or his hosts are likely under surveillance, intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access. Mueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions. Democrats, poised to take power in the House, are already gearing up to reinvigorate a congressional investigation on Russia. What Democrats in Congress will do if they're in power after midterms \u201cA meeting with Julian Assange would be the smoking gun,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee. The House Democratic majority could eventually pose a grave threat to Trump\u2019s presidency and represents a devastating erosion of the force field of political protection so far offered by the GOP majority on Washington power \u2013 another possible reason for his mood. In the long term, any sustained dip in Trump\u2019s popularity \u2013 his disapproval rating climbed to 60% in Gallup\u2019s weekly tracking poll \u2013 could even eventually raise questions about the solidity of his standing among Senate Republicans that has so far always been seen as impenetrable. The latest drama around Manafort is even more tantalizing given the possibility that the collapse of the cooperation agreement could prompt Mueller to reveal more about his tightly private investigation. Special counsel prosecutors plan to detail Manafort\u2019s alleged lies in a number of areas in a sentencing memo that could be filed with the court in the coming weeks. Mueller has used indictments and court filings throughout his tenure to embroider a rich picture of Russian intelligence hacking, a social media campaign to disrupt the election and cozy ties between Manafort and pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine. So expectations will be high ahead of his filing if it is done in public \u201cWithout releasing a report, without another indictment, Mr. Mueller would be in a position to reveal a lot of information that we would all find very interesting about his investigation in open court,\u201d said Ben-Veniste. Such a filing is also now seen in Washington as a potential way around any attempt to disrupt a final report of the Russia investigation by Trump\u2019s acting-Attorney General Matt Whitaker. The new focus on the man picked to succeed the sacked Jeff Sessions may also point to another possible spur for the President\u2019s current fury. Trump has often seemed to know more about the probe than is available, and it\u2019s possible that Whitaker, who is now in charge of overseeing Mueller, has read him in on the inside story of the investigation. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to make clear the White House has said there has been no talk of Trump pardoning Manafort.",

            "article_content": "Though the 2018 election opened intriguing opportunities in the Sun Belt, new data suggest the shortest path back to the White House for Democrats may be through the three Rust Belt swing states that President Donald Trump dislodged from the \u201cblue wall\u201d two years ago. The party will have to choose \u2013 with its nominee, its resources and its message \u2013 whether it wants to focus most on rebuilding that wall \u2013 or on expanding its opportunities in a new set of emerging battleground states across the Sun Belt. As both parties pick through the results of this month\u2019s midterm for clues about possible shifts in the 2020 presidential map, previously unpublished results from the Election Day exit poll show that Trump faced pointed erosion in approval of his job performance from a wide range of critical groups in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the three states that keyed his victory in 2016. In particular, the exit polls showed that in those three states Trump not only faced surging opposition from college-educated white women, but also suffered notable attrition among the blue-collar white women who were critical to his success there last time. Those exit poll results reinforce the evidence from the elections themselves, in which Democrats held a Senate seat and won the governorship in each state, while also gaining a net of five House seats in Pennsylvania and Michigan combined. All of those results have cemented a quick consensus among many Democratic strategists that those three states, which Trump carried by a combined 80,000 votes in 2016, represent the weakest link in his Electoral College majority. \u201cThe quickest way to win again is to get those three states back into the Democratic fold, and I think we\u2019ve already seen tremendous evidence they are ready to come,\u201d says Tad Devine, who helped to manage Electoral College strategy for Democratic presidential nominees from Michael Dukakis to Al Gore and served as a top adviser to Bernie Sanders in 2016. Since World War II, the results of midterm elections have not consistently predicted the outcome of presidential contests two years later. Poor showings by the president\u2019s party in the midterm elections of 1958, 1966, 1974, 1978 and 2006 did foreshadow a switch in control of the White House in the next presidential election. But first-term presidents rebounded to win re-election after significant midterm losses in 1946 (Harry Truman), 1954 (Dwight Eisenhower), 1982 (Ronald Reagan), 1994 (Bill Clinton) and 2010 (Barack Obama). But strategists in both parties believe midterm results can signal shifts in the political currents within individual states. And those changes can influence each side\u2019s calculations about the most promising path to amassing the 270 Electoral College votes required to win the White House. The widespread Democratic gains earlier this month, especially in the House, buoyed the party\u2019s hopes of ousting Trump in two years. But they also ignited an immediate debate about whether the most promising option was to recapture the Rust Belt states that Trump flipped in 2016 or target Sun Belt states where Democrats notched clear gains in 2018, even while falling short in the governors\u2019 races in Georgia and Florida and the US Senate race in Texas. Fresh insights on that question emerge in new data from the exit poll provided by Edison Research, which conducts surveys for the National Election Pool, a consortium of news organizations that includes CNN. The Election Day exit poll asked voters whether they approved or disapproved of Trump\u2019s job performance. At CNN\u2019s request, Edison analyzed Trump\u2019s job approval in the key swing states along lines of race, gender and education. Those results pointed toward clear opportunities for Democrats in the potential 2020 Sun Belt battlegrounds. But they also left little doubt that Trump is most exposed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Those were the three states he dislodged from what I termed the \u201cblue wall,\u201d the 18 states that had voted Democratic in all six presidential elections from 1992 through 2012. The battle for the Sun Belt In the key Sun Belt states where exit polls were conducted this month, Trump\u2019s approval rating consistently hovered right around the critical 50% mark. That ranged from a high of 52% in Georgia and Arizona to 51% in Florida, 49% in Texas and 48% in Nevada. In all these states, Trump demonstrated overwhelming strength among his core constituency of white men without college degrees: His approval among them, according to the exit polls, ranged from 67% in Arizona to 69% in Florida and Nevada to 76% in Texas and fully 80% in Georgia. His numbers among white women without college degrees across the Sun Belt were only slightly less imposing: Those ranged from just under 3 in 5 approval in Nevada, Arizona and Texas to two-thirds in Florida and over 4 in 5 in Georgia. Among college-educated white men, Trump maintained imposing margins in Florida, Georgia and Texas, but they divided about in half over his performance in the Southwest battlegrounds (Arizona and Nevada). Among college-educated white women, the pattern was similar, with one twist. Trump was competitive in Texas and Georgia (where these women split about evenly over his performance). But he faced more widespread resistance again in Arizona and Nevada, this time joined by Florida; about 3 in 5 of them disapproved in each state. Among minorities, Trump faced disapproval ratings exceeding 60% among nonwhite voters both with and without college degrees in Arizona, Nevada and Texas, states where Hispanics dominate the minority population; in Georgia, where most minorities are African-American, Trump faced a minority disapproval rating of almost 80%. In Florida, where both groups are present, he faced disapproval from just over 3 in 5 nonwhites with degrees and fully 7 in 10 of those without, though the Republican US Senate and governor candidates showed surprising resilience with Hispanics in the state. It's not a blue wave. It's a realignment of American politics The narrow overall verdict on Trump\u2019s first two years suggests that all of these Sun Belt states could be competitive in 2020. But the results do raise red flags for each side. Nevada was one of the Hillary Clinton-won states Trump\u2019s camp hoped to target in 2020, but both the election results (Democrats elected a governor and senator) and the exit poll findings (with his weakness among college-educated white men and women and limited support among Hispanics) suggest that will be a very tough climb for him. And while there was no exit poll in Colorado, the Democrats\u2019 strong showing there, particularly in the white-collar Denver suburbs, sends the same message (as well as pinpointing staunchly pro-Trump Republican Sen. Cory Gardner as perhaps the GOP\u2019s most endangered incumbent in 2020). On the other hand, Trump\u2019s overwhelming support among non-college white men and women in Texas, Georgia and Florida underscores the challenge for Democrats of winning those states in a presidential year, when working-class whites usually turn out in higher numbers. Democratic strategists are insistent that Florida remains a \u201ccoin flip\u201d between the parties (particularly after a US Senate race decided for Republican Rick Scott by about 10,000 votes out of more than 8 million cast). But based on these patterns, the party will likely face a more intense debate than previously about how much time and money to invest in the Sunshine State. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s sweep of Texas\u2019 metropolitan areas in his unexpectedly strong showing against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz showed Democrats a viable pathway to competing in the state. And if O\u2019Rourke is on the ballot again in 2020 \u2013 whether in either slot on the Democratic presidential ticket or in another Senate race, against Republican Sen. John Cornyn \u2013 the state may look more attractive to Democrats at the presidential level. \u201cIf he\u2019s back on the ticket, any presidential candidate is going to invest in Texas,\u201d predicts Austin-based Democratic consultant James Aldrete. But if O\u2019Rourke himself isn\u2019t the nominee or vice president, it remains unclear whether any other presidential candidate could commit to the enormous television advertising that would be required to seriously contest the state. \u201cIf you are going to come into that with real resources, that could be worth a half-dozen other states,\u201d notes Devine. It's not a blue wave. It's a realignment of American politics Beyond Florida, the Sun Belt states that emerged from the 2018 results as the most widely agreed-on targets for Democrats are likely Arizona and North Carolina. Though an exit poll was not conducted in North Carolina, the election results there showed continuing Democratic strength in suburban areas. But the results also suggest Democrats may face the same 2020 headwind as in Georgia, Texas and Florida: little erosion for Trump in the blue-collar and rural communities that powered his victory last time. Arizona may be the most promising new Sun Belt opportunity of all, with Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s US Senate win over Rep. Martha McSally providing clear evidence that white-collar suburbanites there moved away from the GOP even more than their counterparts in Texas or Georgia. Maricopa County, surrounding Phoenix, was the largest US county that Trump carried in 2016, but Sinema won it by about 60,000 votes. Across the Rust Belt, with one glaring exception, the evidence from 2018 looks more consistently encouraging for Democrats. Generally, Trump\u2019s overall approval rating in the exit polls across the key Rust Belt states was slightly lower than in the Sun Belt states. In Minnesota, the Midwestern state Republicans most hoped to flip to Trump in 2020, the results and the exit polls offer him little encouragement. Democrats won two Senate seats (including a special election) and the governorship, and the exit poll put Trump\u2019s approval at just 45%. Conversely, the most daunting Rust Belt results for Democrats came in Ohio. Though Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, a potential 2020 contender, won re-election, his margin was narrower than expected and Republicans comfortably held the governor\u2019s mansion. In the exit poll, 52% of Ohio voters approved of Trump\u2019s performance. And while college-educated white women tilted slightly away from him (with 52% of them disapproving), he retained very strong numbers there among non-college white men (67% approval), college-educated white men (62%) and non-college white women (59%). But, if anything, Trump\u2019s continued Ohio strength among those groups only underscored his more precarious position with them in the other key Rust Belt battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. \u201cI think Ohio is much more of a core red state than the other three,\u201d says John Brabender, a Pennsylvania-based GOP strategist. \u201cThe other ones are at their hearts blue states that will sometimes vote Republican. And it better be an awfully good year.\u201d In the exit poll, Trump\u2019s approval rating among voters stood at only 44% in Michigan, 45% in Pennsylvania and 47% in Wisconsin. In each state the share of voters who strongly disapproved of his performance exceeded the share that strongly approved by at least 15 percentage points, a daunting margin. Across the three states, key demographic groups also reacted to Trump in similar ways. Among white men without college degrees, Trump remained strong, drawing positive job marks from 70% of them in Pennsylvania, 65% in Michigan and a somewhat more equivocal 57% in Wisconsin. He remained relatively solid, though somewhat diminished, among college-educated white men as well, winning approval from nearly 3 in 5 in Wisconsin, just over half in Michigan and just under half in Pennsylvania. But Trump showed conspicuous weakness with women across all three states. His disapproval ratings among college-educated white women reached 69% in Pennsylvania, 67% in Michigan and 64% in Wisconsin. Perhaps even more ominously, his disapproval rating in the three states among white women without college degrees spiked to between 46% and 48%, considerably more than in any other battleground state. His approval rating with them in each state stood at just 51% to 53%. That was closer to his unsteady position with those women in Democratic-leaning Minnesota (where they divided about equally over his performance), than in more reliably Republican Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia. In most places, Democrats were frustrated by their inability to recover more ground with working-class white women (56% of them voted Republican in House races, according to the exit poll). But in the three states where those women will likely matter most in 2020, they displayed clear second thoughts about Trump. Brabender says these reactions capture \u201cthe paradox\u201d of Trump\u2019s style: While his iconoclastic and often belligerent language convinces many working-class voters, especially men, that he\u2019s committed to shaking up the system on their behalf, it also alienates more moderate voters, especially women. \u201cThe paradox is that what the others see as evidence this is going to be a different type of president, among some of the more moderate voters, particularly women, they have problems with that tone,\u201d he says. Because African-Americans compose the preponderance of the minority population in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Trump\u2019s approval rating among nonwhite voters is also lower there than in most of the Sun Belt states. All these patterns loom over the upcoming Democratic presidential primary. One of the core choices Democrats will face in picking their 2020 nominee is whether to nominate a candidate best suited to mobilize younger and nonwhite voters who don\u2019t usually turn out, or one most effective at reassuring center-right whites who usually vote Republican but have recoiled from Trump on personal and cultural grounds. (The first group could include Sen. Kamala Harris of California, O\u2019Rourke and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; the second Joe Biden, Michael Bloomberg and an array of current and former governors.) That debate carries a clear geographic implication: \u201cMobilization\u201d candidates are probably best positioned to compete in the Sun Belt, while \u201creassurance\u201d candidates may be more effective in the Rust Belt. The 2018 results leave both paths open to Democrats \u2013 and indeed they indicate that Democrats must compete on both fronts, because they are not guaranteed success on either. When Trump himself is on the ballot \u2013 and able to create contrasts, particularly around cultural and racial issues, with a Democratic nominee \u2013 Democrats may struggle to hold the ground they regained earlier this month with working-class whites in the big Rust Belt battlegrounds. Even so, the clearest signal from this month\u2019s results may be a variation on the old dictum from the legendary Ohio State football coach, Woody Hayes. Stressing a straightforward running game over a flashier passing attack, Hayes famously declared that the best route to victory on the football field was \u201cthree yards and a cloud of dust.\u201d For all the glitter of their new Sun Belt opportunities, Democrats eyeing the cracks in Trump\u2019s armor that emerged this month in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania may likewise conclude that the surest path to success in 2020 will be \u201cthree states and a cloud of dust.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans need to hold small conservative towns like this one in southeastern Kansas if they have any hope of keeping the House majority next week. So staffers for the GOP candidate in this House race, Steve Watkins, reacted with delight when during a day of door knocking here, a voter walked out onto her front steps and parroted a Republican attack line bombarding the airwaves. \u201cShady Paul Davis!\u201d she blared, a reference to the aggressive attack ads launched by House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s super PAC, which is berating the Democratic candidate in a multimillion-dollar ad campaign shaping this critical race. Here in the 2nd Congressional District of Kansas, Republicans are mounting a furious push to save a seat that has been in their party\u2019s control for a decade \u2013 one of two seats in this deep-red state that President Donald Trump won by more than 20 points but could flip to the Democrats come Election Day. The GOP gave an opening to Democrats with the retirement of Republican Rep. Lynn Jenkins and nominated a political novice who has faced serious questions about whether he inflated his resume \u2013 all the while facing an experienced Democrat who is raising far more money than his opponent. Nancy Pelosi is right. Democrats should win the House on Tuesday. But while a victory here could help flip the House to the Democrats \u2013 and help make Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California the speaker again \u2013 it also underscores the challenges for a party on the cusp of returning to power. Democrats like Davis are running away from their party\u2019s leader \u2013 and may need to continue keeping their distance from their leadership to hold on to their seats in conservative districts. First, though, Pelosi will have to win the gavel \u2013 without the support of Democrats like Davis. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a circumstance in which I\u2019m going to support Pelosi,\u201d Davis told CNN in Lawrence, Kansas. \u201cI think Democrats generally are going to have to figure out who\u2019s the candidate that can get to 218 votes.\u201d Davis added: \u201cI think there are times where you just need some new blood, and I think that this is the time.\u201d If Pelosi becomes speaker, she will likely preside over a caucus with a diverse set of members, with some pushing for impeaching Trump and others eager to align themselves with the White House. Davis, who preaches bipartisanship, tried to tamp down talk about impeaching the President. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to Washington to impeach the President,\u201d Davis said. Asked if he would rule that out no matter what emerges from the Russia investigation, he said: \u201cWhat I can say is this: I\u2019m not interested in going to Washington to impeach the President. I think impeaching a president is a sad event for our country.\u201d According to a CNN tally, 30 Democrats in races that the party has a good chance of winning have already vowed to oppose Pelosi. That means the margin of a Democratic majority will be critical for her to ascend to the speakership. A tiny majority, of one or two seats, could be problematic. But a bigger majority will allow her to afford defections on the House floor when she\u2019ll need 218 votes \u2013 or a majority of members present and voting for a candidate \u2013 to win the speakership. Nancy Pelosi has a major impeachment problem But not all Pelosi detractors will likely win their races. And she has deep ties to much of the caucus, in no small part to her eye-popping fundraising \u2013 more than $121 million for her party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2013 meaning she stands a good shot at becoming speaker in a Democratic majority. The DCCC used that money to bombard key races with ads as well, including just over $3 million in this race, which has seen more than $12 million worth of ads on both sides \u2013 most of them negative. And that\u2019s what has Republicans like Watkins saying the opposition to Pelosi is a farce. \u201cHe\u2019s saying what he thinks he has to say in order to get elected,\u201d said Watkins, an Army veteran and first-time candidate, who also worked as a defense contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cAnd Kansas voters aren\u2019t being fooled by that.\u201d The bigger question is whether the ties to Pelosi will even be a deciding factor in this conservative district. As they went door-to-door here in Chanute last week, Watkins\u2019 aides said Pelosi is a motivating factor for some voters. But, they said, she\u2019s not the only issue dominating the race. \u201cI\u2019d say one out of every four people bring up control of Congress,\u201d said Dylan Jones, Watkins\u2019 campaign field director. \u201cSo if they\u2019re saying, \u2018We need to control Congress and Republicans need to get out and vote,\u2019 then those people, one out of four, bring up Pelosi.\u201d Indeed, other issues have dominated attention in this race, including questions about Watkins\u2019 resume. It started in the GOP primary, with reports about meetings he purportedly held with local Democratic officials in 2017 as he was weighing a run for the seat. Davis says Watkins has pulled a bait-and-switch. \u201cHe started the campaign by talking to Democratic leaders,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd said when meeting with them he was pro-choice, he was pro-LGBT, he was pro-labor union, told them all the things that they wanted to hear. And then he found out that I was gonna run and then he goes and becomes a Republican and now he has taken the opposite position on all of those issues.\u201d Watkins calls that story \u201cfake news,\u201d saying he is running now because \u201cI had to look for other ways to serve\u201d after being injured while working as a defense contractor in war zones. \u201cOh, not at all,\u201d Watkins said when asked about meetings he reportedly took with Democrats. \u201cNot at all. No, that was fake news propagated by my opponents who were running behind in the polls. That was absolutely not true. I would never entertain running as a Democrat.\u201d He emerged from a crowded primary, he said, partly because of his outsider image. \u201cWe knocked on 1,000 doors a day not to persuade but to listen,\u201d Watkins said about this sparsely populated district. \u201cAnd what we heard was that people were really still attracted to an outsider.\u201d While Davis said he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, Watkins said he didn\u2019t vote at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote in 2016. Regretfully, it was a big mistake of mine,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cMy focus was elsewhere.\u201d But other issues about Watkins\u2019 career have taken attention in the race. He had told voters that he started and grew a defense contracting company from scratch. Then the Kansas City Star reported, based on interviews with company officials and records, the company existed before he joined as a consultant. Watkins told CNN he wasn\u2019t misleading voters. \u201cSee, I didn\u2019t own the company,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cBut I helped start and grow it operationally. And that\u2019s where they\u2019re thinking that they\u2019re fashioning me as the liar. That\u2019s simply not true.\u201d Still other embarrassing stories have since come out, including one from The Associated Press calling into question a 2015 expedition he took on Mount Everest when a major earthquake occurred in Nepal. Watkins\u2019 campaign website quoted an individual who said he showed \u201cheroic leadership amid the chaos.\u201d But that man, Guy Cotter, told the AP that he never made those remarks and claimed there was nothing they could have really done to help in the deadly situation. Nepal earthquake's victims overwhelm hospitals Asked about the episode, Watkins said he recalled Cotter making those remarks to him. But he said he removed the testimonial once concerns were raised. Nevertheless, he says, \u201cNothing that happened or didn\u2019t happen was even being contested.\u201d \u201cWhat happened was that there was a 7.8 magnitude earthquake,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cWe found ourselves \u2013 I was at 19,000 feet. We lived. There were several other fatalities. I exchanged compliments with another climber who doesn\u2019t remember the nature of that compliment being the same as I quoted. I said sorry, I took it down.\u201d Davis said it shows Watkins\u2019 lack of disregard for the truth. \u201cThis is just a pattern that we have seen over and over from Steve Watkins,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can be trusted.\u201d But Davis, too, has endured sharp attacks about his past. Ryan\u2019s super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, has dropped $3.7 million on the airwaves, with many attacks calling Davis \u201cshady\u201d over an embarrassing incident from 1998. At the time, Davis was at a strip club getting a lap-dance from a topless woman when the police entered the venue on a raid for drugs. Davis, who was 26 and not married at the time, was not charged with any crime, but a police report said it found him in a \u201csomewhat compromising position\u201d with the dancer. He says he was in the club only because his boss, one of his legal clients, was the owner of the facility and took him to the venue. The controversy flared up in the heat of Davis\u2019 unsuccessful run for governor in 2014 against Republican Sam Brownback. And it hasn\u2019t stopped since. \u201cWell, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d Davis told CNN when asked to recount the 1998 incident. \u201cAnd, you know, it\u2019s one incident and I think it\u2019s old news to most Kansans. They ran this attack back in 2014 when I ran for governor and I don\u2019t think it was effective then, and I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s effective now.\u201d Asked about the incident, Watkins said: \u201cWell, you know, if I was in his position, I wouldn\u2019t have found myself in a strip club in the \u201990s.\u201d But he also distanced himself from the aggressive GOP attack ads, a sign that voters may be growing weary at this stage of the hard-fought campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t support \u2013 they\u2019re not a product of me,\u201d Watkins said about the GOP ads, stopping short of saying they should be taken down. \u201cI\u2019ve run an aspirational campaign.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Members of the House of Representatives have no say in whether professor Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh sink his Supreme Court nomination. But as much as the contentious confirmation fight over Kavanaugh played out on television screens across the country on Thursday has put vulnerable Democratic senators in the spotlight, it may be at-risk House Republicans who ultimately feel the most heat. The counter-intuitive dynamic is rooted in the midterms map: Whereas many of the key Senate battlegrounds are deeply Republican states where President Donald Trump won handily in 2016, the fight for the House is taking place in suburban districts in states like California, Pennsylvania and New York \u2014 areas with high proportions of college-educated women who could be particularly moved by Ford\u2019s allegations and her emotional testimony to the Senate. \u201cThis hearing, and the entire Supreme Court fight, actually may do more to hurt the GOP in House \u2026 than it does in the Senate, despite the fact that senators are voting on it,\u201d said one House Democratic campaign veteran. \u201cMitch McConnell and (Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman) Chuck Grassley may be helping end the Republican majority in Congress.\u201d Key senators for Kavanaugh's vote met in Capitol office While some Republicans said a capable House candidate would come out of this debate unscathed, other party operatives fear the spectacle that engulfed the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday could deepen misgivings among voters \u2013 particularly women \u2013 about the Republican Party, which has consistently underperformed in generic polling leading during this midterm election cycle. A GOP campaign operative put it bluntly: \u201cThe women are gone. It\u2019s all about the base.\u201d And that sentiment was backed up by the judge\u2019s combative performance, which at times mimicked the President himself with direct attacks against the media, Democrats on the committee and even a passing reference to Bill and Hillary Clinton. \u201cVoters certainly vote on the candidates in individual races, but they also vote as a choice between two parties,\u201d the Democratic campaign veteran added. \u201cAnd the brand of the Republican Party is now the party of this hearing and the party of Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d A host of Democratic candidates, particularly those running to represent heavily suburban districts, jumped on the Kavanaugh hearing, particularly Ford\u2019s compelling an emotional testimony. In the race against Republican Rep. Peter Roskam in the Chicago suburbs, Democrat Sean Casten has been honing in on Kavanaugh since his nomination in July, initially focusing on concerns that Kavanaugh might vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Decades ago, Roskam\u2019s district was represented by Henry Hyde, the namesake of the Hyde Amendment restricting federal funding for abortions. But the district\u2019s complexion has shifted since Hyde\u2019s time, and Casten has sought to capitalize on a growing pro-choice contingent. Casten has also used Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to criticize Roskam as a rubber stamp for the President; this week, the Casten campaign has promoted an ad on Facebook calling on Roskam to withdraw his support for the embattled nominee. But the dramatic hearing Thursday, including Ford\u2019s tearful testimony, has upped the ante further. \u201cI think it means we\u2019re going to keep the pressure on (Roskam), that people should believe women,\u201d said Greg Bales, Casten\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cShe (Ford) showed incredible courage, and Peter Roskam doesn\u2019t have the courage to stand up to Trump.\u201d \u201cThis is an important issue,\u201d Bales added, \u201cand we\u2019re going to continue bringing attention to it.\u201d Brett Kavanaugh declares innocence as hearing turns into partisan brawl Roskam\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Casten\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t alone. In New Jersey\u2019s 7th District, another crucial battleground, Democrat Tom Malinowski\u2019s campaign posted a video on Facebook of his Republican opponent, Rep. Leonard Lance, praising Kavanaugh and saying \u201cI tend not to believe the charges\u201d of sexual misconduct against him. \u201cLeonard Lance\u2019s first instinct \u2014 the woman is lying,\u201d reads a message at the conclusion of the video, which has so far been viewed around 8,000 times. \u201cThat\u2019s the real Leonard Lance.\u201d And in Colorado\u2019s 6th District, where Democrat Jason Crow is challenging Republican Rep. Mike Coffman, Crow released a statement praising Ford\u2019s testimony as \u201cincredibly brave\u201d and calling on Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to be withdrawn. Meanwhile, as the hearing played out Thursday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent a fundraising email signed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, in which she invoked the spectacle and Republicans\u2019 continued support for Kavanaugh. \u201cWe can \u2014 and WILL \u2014 punish these despicable Republicans and win a Democratic Congress that\u2019ll render them powerless,\u201d Pelosi wrote, before soliciting donations to the committee. Republican campaign operatives reacted to the hearing with a mixture of concern and resolve. Ford \u201ccertainly came across as an accomplished professional and someone who isn\u2019t fabricating her story,\u201d acknowledged one party operative working on the midterms. \u201cBut there are a ton of holes there.\u201d And some Republicans downplayed the possible political impact of the hearings, predicting that Kavanaugh\u2019s passionate defense of his character could enliven GOP voters \u2013 a crucial page in the GOP playbook this year. \u201cThere\u2019s an argument it will hurt among college-educated women,\u201d said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist and former senior aide to Speaker John Boehner. \u201cThere\u2019s another argument that any college-educated woman who\u2019s turned off by this probably was turned off by the President\u2019s statements and actions a long time ago.\u201d Meanwhile, Steel added, \u201cthis could serve to energize and rally the core Trump supporters to get out and vote.\u201d Suburban women were overwhelmingly opposed to Kavanaugh even before the dramatic testimonies Thursday \u2013 with a recent Fox News poll showing just 32% of suburban women in favor, and 63% against confirming him. As Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation has become a political flashpoint, much of the focus politically has been on vulnerable Senate Democrats, who will vote yea or nay on his nomination. Three of Democratic senators from red states supported Justice Neil Gorsuch last year. But with Ford\u2019s allegations and her testimony on live television Thursday, along with Kavanaugh\u2019s defense, the story is now captivating a nation \u2013 and extending beyond the Senate battlegrounds. In addition to House candidates, Democratic candidates for governor also weighed in on Kavanaugh and Ford, including Andrew Gillum in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s a major moment \u2013 a major television moment, and a major political moment,\u201d said Doug Thornell, a Democratic strategist and former DCCC spokesperson. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s not something that is limited to the Senate, it sort of transcends that.\u201d A top Republican working in one swing district admitted that it is hard to know \u201cwhether or not something like this affects a race.\u201d \u201cYou have to know your candidate is someone who has built a strong reputation in his district, is respected, well liked and thoughtful,\u201d they said. \u201cWhen you have a candidate like that, they end up running on their record, and people tend to drown out the surrounding noise that isn\u2019t directly related to your race.\u201d They added: \u201cUltimately, good candidates get people to vote for them as opposed to go against someone else.\u201d In light of the hearings Thursday, however, Steel predicted that some Republican House candidates in suburban districts might begin to distance themselves from Kavanaugh, including by \u201csuggest(ing) that the process could have been carried out differently, and obviously ultimate blame starts with Senate Democrats who were aware of these allegations for weeks.\u201d Steel added, \u201cI would imagine there would be a lot of House members who say that they want a conservative justice, but maybe Kavanaugh wasn\u2019t the right choice for this time.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Democrats look well-positioned to retake the House majority in the midterm elections, fueled by their base\u2019s animosity toward President Donald Trump and absolutely committed to using the vote in 55 days\u2019 time to send a message to him. Should the energized Democratic base deliver Nancy Pelosi the speakership she lost in the 2010 election, it would be a remarkable journey for the California Democrat, who has weathered eight years of speculation about her political future and growing calls within her caucus for her to step aside. It would also present Pelosi with a massive dilemma \u2013 as made plain by a new CNN-SSRS poll released on Wednesday morning. Asked whether they believe that Trump \u201cshould be impeached and removed from office,\u201d or not, 47% said Trump should be impeached while 48% said they don\u2019t feel that way. Support for Trump\u2019s impeachment has grown from 42% in a CNN-SSRS poll conducted earlier this summer. (By comparison, 29% of people said then-President Barack Obama should be impeached and 70% said they didn\u2019t feel that way in a CNN poll conducted in late November 2014.) Being indicted isn't Donald Trump's problem. Impeachment might be. Those numbers, on their face, are stunning. Less than two years into Trump\u2019s term, half the country would like to see him impeached. Like, now. But dig into the party and ideological breakdowns of that impeachment questions, and Pelosi\u2019s potential dilemma becomes very, very clear. Almost eight in 10 (78%) Democrats believe Trump should be impeached immediately, while only 16% don\u2019t feel that way. The numbers among self-described \u201cliberals\u201d are nearly the same; 79% want Trump impeached as compared to 17% who don\u2019t.   You don\u2019t have to be a political genius to see the writing on the wall there: hardcore Democrats, the sort who are likely to turn out in droves come November 6, want Trump gone. Or at the very least, they want their leadership to push for articles of impeachment to be brought against him. Which brings me back to Pelosi. She has been crystal clear for the last several months that she believes talking about impeaching Trump is a major mistake for her party. \u201cI do not think that impeachment is a policy agenda,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo back in May. Last month, after longtime Trump attorney and personal fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to a number of charges including campaign finance violations, in which he suggested Trump was an active part of an effort to conceal hush payments to two women alleging affairs, Pelosi remained adamant that impeachment was not the right choice for the party. She called it \u201cnot a priority,\u201d adding: \u201cImpeachment has to spring from something else.\u201d Ayanna Pressley's win shows just being liberal isn't enough in today's Democratic Party As the new CNN poll shows, that stance puts Pelosi out-of-step with the overwhelming majority of her party\u2019s base. Which, politically speaking, is never a good place to be. Now. Pelosi\u2019s arguments about impeachment deal with the here and now. Wary of handing Trump and Republicans an issue to campaign on, she has sought to downplay the idea in the context of the midterms. (Trump, of course, has seized on the idea of Democrats pushing for impeachment \u2013 asking how he could possibly be impeached when he is doing such a good job.) Pelosi\u2019s stance on not talking about impeachment right now, her allies would argue, doesn\u2019t preclude her from embracing such a move post-election if circumstances change. In fact, Pelosi has nodded to the ongoing special counsel probe by Robert Mueller as something that needs to play out before the party even seriously engages with the idea of impeachment. Cory Booker threatened to break the rules to show he can play Donald Trump's game But for now the fact remains: Pelosi, who is widely seen as the next speaker of the House if Democrats can re-take the majority in 55 days\u2019 time, is not in the same place as the preponderance of the rank-and-file within her party on the impeachment question. It speaks, I think, to the broader disconnect between a base that wants to employ any means necessary to obstruct and remove Trump, and a party establishment \u2013 even among avowed liberals like Pelosi \u2013 that remains concerned over the potential political backlash to the move. I\u2019ve covered too many of Pelosi\u2019s successful leadership elections to predict that her dilemma on impeachment could lead to her defeat for the top job if Democrats take back the House. But it does speak to a larger divide within the party that will play out between now and 2020 as Democratic politicians try to find the right way to position themselves against Trump. If the CNN poll is any indication, for the base, the more anti-Trump and pro-impeachment you are, the better.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Mark Sanford became the latest proof point that fealty to President Donald Trump \u2013 much more than purity on the issues \u2013 matters most in GOP politics. The South Carolina congressman\u2019s loss in Tuesday\u2019s primary was the most stunning outcome on a day that voters in Virginia, Maine, Nevada and North Dakota also went to the polls. In Democratic primaries \u2013 particularly three key House races in Virginia \u2013 the theme of this spring\u2019s primaries continued: Female candidates are winning at unprecedented rates and often by large margins. Here are six things we learned in Tuesday\u2019s primaries: Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake was driven into retirement. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker couldn\u2019t win the White House\u2019s support to run for re-election. Alabama Rep. Martha Roby was forced into a runoff. And on Tuesday, Sanford became the latest Republican punished by voters for criticizing Trump, losing narrowly to state Rep. Katie Arrington. Arrington\u2019s campaign was based on the premise that Sanford \u2013 who has criticized Trump\u2019s style and questioned his knowledge \u2013 is insufficiently supportive of the President. It\u2019s the same reason Alabama Rep. Martha Roby, who blasted Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape became public in 2016, is headed to a runoff to defend her seat. How to sound smart about Tuesday's primaries Trump weighed in himself less than three hours before the polls closed Tuesday. He tweeted: \u201cMark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!\u201d Sanford made enemies as governor in 2009, when he disappeared to Argentina during an extramarital affair. That scandal loomed large in the race, with both Trump and Arrington mocking the excuse Sanford had initially used in covering up his affair: that he\u2019d been \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail.\u201d In an ad, Arrington urged voters to tell Sanford to \u201ctake a hike.\u201d Corey Stewart, the bombastic conservative who built his public image on championing the Confederate flag and monuments like Charlottesville\u2019s Robert E. Lee statue and has appeared with white nationalists, won the Republican Senate nomination. State and national Republicans admitted there\u2019s virtually no chance Stewart will defeat Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in the fall. Their bigger worry, though, is how Stewart\u2019s presence on the ballot could lead Republican voters to stay at home, hurting the party in several competitive House races. \u201cI am extremely disappointed that a candidate like Corey Stewart could win the Republican nomination for US Senate,\u201d former Virginia Republican Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling tweeted. \u201cThis is clearly not the Republican Party I once knew, loved and proudly served. Every time I think things can\u2019t get worse they do, and there is no end in sight.\u201d Brian J. Walsh, a Republican strategist who has worked on Senate campaigns, tweeted: \u201cCan we just skip past the part where the media focuses on all the idiotic, racist & embarrassing things Corey Stewart will say & do the next five months and just acknowledge Tim Kaine won his re-election tonight. And he has Stewart voters to thank for it.\u201d The year of the woman continues. Women will represent Democrats in all four of Virginia\u2019s competitive House races in November, the latest example of the party turning to women to unseat vulnerable Republicans in the Trump era. On Tuesday, three women \u2013 Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton \u2013 won Democratic primaries. Earlier this year at the party convention, journalist Leslie Cockburn won the nomination in Virginia\u2019s 5th Congressional District. \u201cWomen have been leading the resistance, leading in activism and come November they will lead the way in Democrats taking back the House,\u201d said Christina Reynolds, top strategist for EMILY\u2019s List, a Democratic organization that recruits and funds pro-choice Democratic women to run for office. \u201cVirginia is a key part of that effort and EMILY\u2019s List is proud to stand with the women running in these targeted races.\u201d A record number of Democratic women have filed to run for Congress since Trump stepped into the White House, with many telling CNN that they chose to run in response to Trump\u2019s presidency. To date, 476 women have filed to run for the House in 2018, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, surpassing the 272 who filed in 2016. Democrats notched another win in state legislative special elections on Tuesday, the party\u2019s 43rd red-to-blue flip since Trump stepped into the White House last year. Caleb Frostman, the Democrat running in Wisconsin State Senate District 1, claimed victory in Tuesday\u2019s special election and Frostman\u2019s campaign manager, Hannah Akbik, told CNN that Republican Andre Jacque conceded the race in a phone call with the Democrat. Jacque confirmed his concession in a phone call with CNN. The district, which stretches up past Green Bay along Wisconsin\u2019s northern peninsula, has traditionally been Republican, with the GOP incumbent who ran in 2014 winning with 62% of the vote. While it was not all good news for Democrats in Wisconsin on Tuesday \u2013 Ann Groves Lloyd, the Democrat running in the special election in Wisconsin State Assembly District 42, conceded to her Republican opponent \u2013 national Democratic operatives argue their showing in state legislative races shows voters are prepared to rebuke the President in November. Two low-key primaries went exactly as expected Tuesday. North Dakota Republicans chose Rep. Kevin Cramer to challenge vulnerable Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. And Nevada Democrats picked Rep. Jacky Rosen as their nominee against Republican Sen. Dean Heller. The drama evaporated from both races after direct intervention from Trump and his political team to convince Cramer \u2013 who\u2019d already publicly said he wouldn\u2019t run \u2013 to change his mind and launch a campaign in February. A month later, Trump and his 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale pushed Danny Tarkanian out of the GOP primary against Heller, eliminating a serious threat to the nation\u2019s most vulnerable Republican incumbent. The two primaries were sleepy Tuesday, but will be among the nation\u2019s most important battlegrounds in November. Election nights are long \u2013 no matter what. But asking voters multiple questions on each race further drags things out. So far, CNN has been unable to project a winner in the Maine House District or either the Democrat or Republican primary for Maine governor. While you wait, though, check out this is saucy video of one of Sen. Angus King\u2019s opponents, who ran unopposed for the Republican nomination, has online. He\u2019s a long shot.",

The district, which stretches up past Green Bay along Wisconsin\u2019s Door Peninsula, has traditionally been Republican, with the GOP incumbent who ran in 2014 winning with 62% of the vote. It was not all good news for Democrats in Wisconsin on Tuesday. Ann Groves Lloyd, the Democrat running in the special election in Wisconsin State Assembly District 42, conceded to Republican Jon Plumer, according to Lloyd\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cI congratulate Jon on running a great race and thank the voters of the 42nd Assembly District for their support,\u201d Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brad Courtney said Tuesday. \u201cHard-working Wisconsin families are seeing the real results of our bold conservative reforms.\u201d EMILY\u2019s List, an organization that recruits and funds pro-choice Democrats, endorsed and spent money on Lloyd\u2019s behalf. Both of the special elections were created when the incumbents were appointed to positions in the Walker administration. Initially, Walker said he would wait to fill these seats until November, but he was sued by the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, former Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s organization, and Dane County Circuit Judge Josann Reynolds ruled in March that Walker had to hold special elections. \u201cI want to congratulate Caleb Frostman for winning a seat in the Wisconsin State Senate,\u201d Holder said on Tuesday. \u201cScott Walker and his Republican allies gerrymandered this district for their own partisan benefit, but the citizens of Wisconsin are clearly speaking out this year to demand a state government that better represents their values.\u201d Frostman\u2019s win represents the 43rd state legislative seat Democrats have flipped since Trump took office in January 2017, a trend that national Democratic operatives argue shows voters are prepared to rebuke the President in November. The 43 wins for Democrats have not been a net gain, however. Democrats, in some cases, have lost state legislative seats, like in California where voters recalled Democrat Josh Newman and replaced her with Republican Ling Ling Chang earlier this month. The Democratic Governor\u2019s Association, though, cast Frostman\u2019s win as bad news for Walker, who is running for reelection in 2018. \u201cTonight\u2019s special election win for Democrats in Wisconsin is more bad news and yet another \u2018wake up call\u2019 for Scott Walker, and he knows it,\u201d DGA Executive Director Elisabeth Pearson said Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was willing to break the law to avoid these elections being held at all.",

            "article_content": "Today is one of the most important primary days of the year. Eight states are voting, including California, which will have a huge impact on the fall, including Democrats\u2019 chances of taking back the House. It\u2019s not Republicans that may squander their chances though \u2013 it\u2019s Democrats themselves who may fall victim to the primary rules in California that could knock them off the ballot in some districts by the end of the night. DEMOCRATIC CALIFORNIA DREAM TURNED NIGHTMARE? Democrats expect to net at least three House seats in California come November in order to win back the House \u2013 roughly one eighth of the 23 total net pickups they will need overall. Nine of the 10 California House districts rated as competitive by CNN are currently held by Republicans, seven of which are in districts that voted for Clinton in 2016. However, crowded Democratic fields in three of these seats that are trending blue could result in two Republicans making the general election \u2013 a political \u201cown goal\u201d that would take the seats off Democrats\u2019 target lists come the fall and significantly set back their efforts to win control of the House in the state that styles itself as the very heart of \u201cthe resistance.\u201d REPUBLICANS FIGHT FOR SPACE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET: In California\u2019s Senate race, longtime Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein faces a challenge from the left in former State Senate President pro tempore Kevin De Leon and a long list of other candidates. Feinstein has remained the frontrunner, and the big question is whether or not a Republican can break through into the top two. A similar dynamic is playing out in the race for governor, where former San Francisco Mayor and current Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom narrowly leads a field whose other top contenders include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa \u2013 also a Democrat \u2013 and Republican businessman John Cox, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump. Republicans hope to be able to crack into the top two of either race, and Cox has a strong shot at doing so in the gubernatorial contest. Should both end up being Democrat vs. Democrat general elections, that could have a serious drag on Republican turnout in down ballot races come November. TESTER MEETS HIS OPPONENT: Montana Republicans will choose between three leading candidates in a primary race to take on vulnerable incumbent Democrat Jon Tester, who is running for his third Senate term in a state that voted for President Trump by roughly 20 points. Democrats seem most concerned about facing State Auditor Matt Rosendale, but the primary race should be close between him, businessman and Air Force veteran Troy Downing, and former Judge Russ Fagg. Republicans see this seat as a perfect opportunity for a flip, but Tester\u2019s significant money advantage could keep his Senate career afloat, as CNN rates this race lean Democrat. MORE TROUBLE FOR US REPS? In South Dakota, four-term Rep. Kristi Noem is running in the Republican primary for governor against the state\u2019s Attorney General Marty Jackley, who recently released an ad attacking Noem as a \u201cD.C. politician who breaks their promises and will say anything to get elected.\u201d Several of Noem\u2019s House colleagues have already lost their primary bids for higher office to state/local politicians or political outsiders, a trend CNN will continue to monitor throughout the midterm primary season. Meanwhile, Alabama GOP Rep. Martha Roby (AL-02) must get past four Republicans gunning for her seat \u2014 including former Democratic Rep. Bobby Bright and a former Roy Moore aide \u2014 to secure re-nomination. She publicly withdrew her support of candidate Trump in October 2016 following the Access Hollywood tape release to the frustration of some of the President\u2019s supporters and won reelection with only 49% of the vote that year. Roby must clear 50% on Tuesday night to avoid a runoff, otherwise the top two candidates will face off on Tuesday, July 17. LEFT BEHIND? Democrats are facing an intra-party fight with progressives in New Jersey and Iowa. Many grassroots activists are frustrated by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee putting their thumb on some races by endorsing candidates they view as not representing their values (the DCCC says they picked candidates with strong appeal to them and the broader electorate). How Democrats fair in New Jersey\u2019s 2nd and 11th Districts, as well as Iowa\u2019s 1st and 3rd Districts, will have a deep impact on the party\u2019s chances of winning the majority in November. If a more liberal candidate wins in these moderate-to-conservative districts, will these seats no longer be in reach for Democrats? It\u2019s a risk the party doesn\u2019t want to take but may not have a choice.",

            "article_content": "Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional delegation next year will no longer be made up of only men. A host of women candidates won their primaries on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, with some entering general election contests that will ensure a woman will represent at least one district in Pennsylvania come 2019. A woman is certain to represent Pennsylvania\u2019s Fifth Congressional District after Mary Gay Scanlon, a member of the Wallingford-Swarthmore school board, won the Democratic primary, and Pearl Kim, a lawyer, won the Republican nomination. The fifth district, which includes much of suburban Philadelphia and the southern reaches of the city, is seen as likely Democratic. Madeleine Dean, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, also won her three-way Democratic primary for the party\u2019s nomination in the fourth congressional district, CNN projects. Because that seat is widely viewed as a safe Democratic seat in all major House rankings, it is likely that Dean will defeat Dan David, her Republican opponent, in November \u2013 barring a major shift in the news. Both of these shifts would be groundbreaking for the commonwealth. All 20 members of Pennsylvania\u2019s current congressional delegation \u2013 including its 18 House members and two senators \u2013 are male. And that\u2019s not for women failing to run. In 2016, seven women ran, with four Democrats and one Republican making it past the primaries. Zero won in the general. The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University rates Pennsylvania as the 38th most representative state for women in elected office and Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at Rutgers, said the state has historically rejected women candidates. \u201cYou have had women candidates who really haven\u2019t been able to break through in general elections,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cSo Pennsylvania will be a good test of (how women candidates will do in 2018) because it is not a state that women have done well historically.\u201d Dean is one of a handful of female candidates that EMILY\u2019s List, a Democratic organization that finds and supports pro-choice Democratic women candidates, endorsed in Pennsylvania. \u201cMadeleine has been fighting for progressive policies in the state House for six years, and we are thrilled that she is another step closer to taking that fight to the halls of Congress,\u201d Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILY\u2019s List, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe women and working families of this district will be well-served by a champion like Madeleine, which is why we are so proud to stand with her and congratulate her tonight.\u201d Susan Wild, an attorney who was also endorsed by EMILY\u2019s List, also won her race for the Democratic nomination in Pennsylvania\u2019s seventh congressional district, besting John Morganelli, who conceded the race. Wild will have a good chance at reaching Congress, but the race is less solidly Democratic as the fourth district. \u201cEMILY\u2019s List has been and will continue to be with Susan every step of the way,\u201d Schriock said. \u201cWe are proud to congratulate her on her victory tonight.\u201d And Chrissy Houlahan, another EMILY\u2019s List-backed candidate in Pennsylvania, won her unopposed Democratic primary for the sixth congressional district. She will face Republican Greg McCauley in the general election, a race that most rankings have rated a toss-up. This story has been updated to reflect election results.",

            "article_content": "In the blue corner \u2013 he was an unabashed liberal at a time when Democrats ran away and hid at the mention, and among the party\u2019s first and most vocal critics of the Iraq War. He\u2019s campaigned on his support for single-payer health care and a statewide assault weapons ban. And in another blue corner \u2013 the preferred choice of the liberal lioness from Massachusetts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, he led the way in turning her vision for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into a reality during his more than five years as its director. On Tuesday night, the two contenders for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Ohio \u2013 former Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a two-time presidential candidate, and the recently departed CFPB boss, Richard Cordray \u2013 will quit punching and wait on voters\u2019 blessing to lead the left in its race to replace term-limited, anti-Trump Republican Gov. John Kasich. (The winner will take on either GOP state Attorney General Mike DeWine or Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor.) But no matter the result, progressives have already scored a significant victory in the Midwestern bellwether, where the party\u2019s familiar conflicts \u2013 often cast in shorthand as the Hillary-Bernie divide \u2013 have been mostly hung on the ropes as Cordray and Kucinich fought out their campaign on a much narrower, mostly shared piece of political canvas. At the crux of their unexpectedly tight bout is, rather than any brooding, existential question about the future of the party, a case of differing personalities and approaches to policymaking. While there is concern among some state Democrats about Kucinich\u2019s viability in November\u2019s general election, his backers insist that voters \u2013 especially in a state President Donald Trump won by 8 points in 2016 \u2013 are increasingly hungry for what Kucinich is selling (and has, for decades): the aggressive progressive model, quirks and all. The pre-Trump calculus, they argue, doesn\u2019t hold and the bounds of electability are, if not erased, then in need of some serious reconnoitering. Cordray too has been fighting concerns over his demeanor. Modest and wonky, often described as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Warren, he is, in this way at least, an almost mirror image of his bombastic opponent. But where they diverge on major issues, it tends to be in measures of degree. Kucinich, for example, has hammered away at Cordray\u2019s standing with the National Rifle Association (he received an A-rating in 2010), and the latter\u2019s refusal to categorically reject its mission. In April, Cordray on the trail passed up a chance to reject the group, instead describing it as \u201ca mix of things.\u201d \u201cThey do good things that people like and they do some other things that people don\u2019t like,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s true of all organizations.\u201d Cordray, though, is hardly a Second Amendment absolutist. He supports universal background checks and other restrictions opposed by the NRA, like a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines and bump fire stocks. On health care, Kucinich is a proponent of single-payer coverage, or \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d which helped earn him the support of Our Revolution, the political organization inspired by Sen. Bernie Sanders. (The Vermont independent opted to stay out of the race himself.) Cordray has not gone as far, instead advocating for fixes and expansions to the Affordable Care Act, like beefing up state exchanges while maintaining Medicaid expansion and closing \u201ccoverage gaps\u201d for those caught in between. Kucinich has come under varying degrees of scrutiny over news he gave a paid speech in London to a group supportive of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. That, along with a past interview (conducted during his time as a Fox News contributor) of Assad in Damascus, has been a point of attack, though not enough to dissuade Cleveland\u2019s Plain Dealer from giving its endorsement, which came with the caveat that Kucinich \u201cnever again make nice\u201d with the Syrian \u201cbutcher.\u201d That kind of passing rebuke underlines the modest effect the criticism is expected to have on the final outcome. Still, the expectation as voters hit the polls is that, for all the hubbub around Kucinich, Cordray will emerge the winner, even if the margin isn\u2019t quite what many envisioned when he left the CFPB to launch his run. Kucinich is a known and, in some quarters, dear figure to many Ohio progressives. Before heading off to Congress, he was elected a state senator and, in his 20s, won national headlines as the \u201cboy mayor\u201d of Cleveland. He was, and remains, a stalwart of the relatively small and fragmented US anti-war movement. Cordray can\u2019t compete on those terms, but his defiance of Trump and record as the chief federal consumer watchdog \u2013 along with endorsements from NARAL Pro-choice Ohio and the state\u2019s largest organized labor organiztion, the Ohio AFL-CIO \u2013 put him on steady ground with this year\u2019s hard-charging Democratic base. But it is, perhaps more so than most would have imagined a decade ago, also shared ground with his opponent. For progressives, that means waking on Wednesday as winners \u2013 yet again \u2013 no matter who celebrates on Tuesday night.",

            "article_content": "Minutes after they were sent to Congress, former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s private memos on his interactions with President Donald Trump leaked. Capitol Hill\u2019s leakiness is our gain as the 15 pages of memos \u2013 penned by Comey in the days leading up to and covering the early months of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 paint a vivid picture of a chief executive flouting long-established norms of conduct, fixated on the ongoing Russia investigation and absolutely desperate to secure loyalty from Comey \u2013 and everyone else. (It goes without saying \u2013 though I am saying it \u2013 that Comey\u2019s memos represent one side of what is a \u201che said/he said\u201d story.) I went through the memos and pulled out the 11 key passages that you absolutely shouldn\u2019t miss. (You can read the full memos here.) 1. \u201cHe said you saved her and then they hated you for what you did later, but what choice did you have? He said he thought very highly of me and looked forward to working with me, saying he hoped I planned to stay on.\u201d This comes from the January 2017 meeting between Comey and Trump \u2013 less than two weeks before his inauguration. It\u2019s worth noting that, at least in Comey\u2019s telling, Trump didn\u2019t always think he was a \u201cliar\u201d and a \u201cleaker.\u201d The Trump portrayed here by Comey is solicitous and complimentary. 2. \u201cHe then started talking about all the women who had falsely accused him of grabbing or touching them (with particular mention of a \u201cstripper\u201d who said he grabbed her) and gave me the sense he was defending himself to me.\u201d This is that same meeting \u2013 January 2017 \u2013 and comes just after Comey has briefed Trump on the Russian prostitution allegation. The transition from those allegations \u2013 which Trump vehemently denies \u2013 to a recitation of why he is innocent of all the other allegations against him is telling. Trump quite clearly feels as though he needs to prove himself to Comey, to show the director that he\u2019s not that kind of guy. Read: James Comey's memos 3. \u201cThe conversation, which was pleasant at all times, was chaotic, with topics touched, left, then returned to later, making it very difficult to recount in a linear fashion\u2026..It really was conversation-as-jigsaw-puzzle in a way, with pieces picked up, then discarded, then returned to.\u201d No observation anywhere in these memos rings truer of Trump than this one, which comes from the one-on-one dinner the two men at the White House eight days after Trump had been sworn in. Watch any Trump press conference or speech and you are immediately struck by the massively haphazard nature of it.  Trump can jump \u2013 as he did earlier this week \u2013 from his Electoral College win to the situation in North Korea without blinking an eye. To his supporters, it shows an able mind unbound by needing to stay \u201con message.\u201d To his critics it shows someone incapable of focusing on much of anything for any extended period of time. Comey\u2019s recounting of the logical hops in the conversation \u2013 from Trump\u2019s inaugural crowd size to the nastiness of the 2016 campaign to how tall his son, Barron, was is perhaps the most powerful moment in the memos. It captures Trump\u2019s approach and mindset perfectly. 4. \u201cI said I don\u2019t do sneaky things. I don\u2019t leak. I don\u2019t do weasel moves.\u201d Comey critics will fixate on these lines because we know that he leaked parts of these memos after he was fired in an attempt to have a special prosecutor appointed to examine whether \u2013 among other things \u2013 Trump was secretly taping conversations in the White House. By Comey\u2019s own standard \u2013 as laid out above \u2013 his purposeful leak was  \u2018weasel move.\u201d Trump has used Comey\u2019s willingness to leak parts of these memos as disqualifying for the broader account that Comey provides. It isn\u2019t that. But it does suggest that Comey wound up not being exactly who he presented himself to be with the President in that January 2017 dinner. Comey memos renew questions over Trump's behavior 5. \u201cAt this point he asked me (and asked again later) whether \u2018your guy McCabe\u2019 has a problem with me, explaining that \u201cI was pretty rough on him and his wife during the campaign.\u201d This is one of at least three times in the memos that Trump brings up deputy FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe unprompted with Comey. Why? It\u2019s clear Trump is very worried that McCabe may have a vendetta against him because Trump repeatedly attacked McCabe\u2019s wife for running for the Virginia state Senate as a Democrat \u2013 and accepting a large donation from then Gov. Terry McAuliffe. That Trump is fixated on this fact \u2013 and that he never really takes Comey\u2019s assertion that McCabe is a pro\u2019s pro and he has nothing to worry about to heart \u2013 speaks to how he views the world: As a constant battle for control and power with vendettas being held and acted upon at all times. 6. \u201cHe then returned to loyalty, saying \u201cI need loyalty.\u201d I replied that he would always get honesty from me. He paused and said that\u2019s what he wants \u201chonest loyalty.\u201d This back-and-forth sits at the root of so much that happened later \u2013 including Comey\u2019s firing in May. Trump asks for \u201cloyalty\u201d. Comey promises \u201chonesty.\u201d Trump, ever the deal maker, tries \u201chonest loyalty.\u201d Comey writes at the time of the very real possibility that the two men are simply not understanding one another or that their understandings of what happened in that moment differ.  What\u2019s clear \u2013 from Comey\u2019s later memos \u2013 is that Trump seizes on this exchange as a sort of handshake agreement that Comey will always be loyal. Comey, of course, believes he did no such thing. 7. \u201cHe then went on to explain that he has serious reservations about Mike Flynn\u2019s judgment\u2026.the President pointed his fingers at his head and said \u2018the guy has serious judgment issues.\u2019\u201d Reminder: This comment by Trump comes just eight days after he has become President! Which means that he harbored doubts about Flynn long before January 20, 2017. And yet he still chose Flynn as a his national security adviser. Which is curious except when you remember that dogged loyalty is by far the most important thing to Trump. And there was no one more loyal to Trump in the campaign than Flynn. Comey memos detail Trump's comments on Russia, reservations about Flynn 8. \u201cHe then asked, \u2018Do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn?\u2019 I paused for a few seconds and then said that I would answer here, but that this illustrated the kind of question that had to be asked and answered through established channels.\u201d This exchange, between Comey and Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus in early February 2017, speaks volumes about both men. Priebus, a former Republican National Committee chairman, clearly has no idea of the proper bounds of how a White House communicates with the Justice Department about ongoing investigations. It also tells us that Priebus, like Trump, had an inkling that all was not well with Flynn from a very early date. For Comey, his willingness to answer Priebus\u2019 question even while scolding the chief about how he shouldn\u2019t ask that sort of stuff is a pattern that played out throughout his interactions with the President and his administration. On any number of occasions, Comey could have told the President (or Priebus) \u201cno\u201d or made clear that his silence should be treated in no way, shape or form as assent. But, he didn\u2019t do hat. Not ever. 9. \u201cThe president said \u201cthe hookers thing\u201d is nonsense but that Putin had told him \u201cwe have some of those most beautiful hookers in the world.\u201d (He did not say when Putin had told him this.)\u201d Uh, what? When did the Russian president pass along this key bit of information to Trump? Was it in one of the formal calls the two men exchanged post-election? Presumably it had to be because the day before his meeting with Comey, Trump said on Twitter, \u201cI don\u2019t know Putin\u2026\u201d Regardless, that\u2019s sort of a weird thing for Trump to just bring up, no? (Nota bene: This back-and-forth occurred after Comey\u2019s meeting with Priebus in February; the chief of staff brought Comey by the Oval Office to chat with Trump.) Separately, and it\u2019s not clear if this is related, Trump\u2019s former bodyguard privately told the House Intelligence Committee that he nixed an offer by \u201ca Russian\u201d to send five women to then-Private citizen Trump\u2019s hotel room in Moscow in 2013. Keith Schiller said he made sure it didn\u2019t happen. And we don\u2019t know who the \u201cRussian\u201d is. 10. \u201cHe replied that we need to go after the reporters, and referred to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find out what they know, and it worked.\u201d The context of this line from a February 14 meeting is that Trump is upset by the leaks of his less-than-great phone calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico. Comey is not a fan of leakers either and the two men find some common ground on it. It is somewhat chilling to hear that sentiment expressed by the President of the United States. Then there is the fact that the case to which Trump appears to be referring is the jailing of New York Times reporter Judith Miller for the stories she wrote off of the leak of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame. Know who was one of the people convicted in that leak investigation? None other than Scooter Libby, who Trump pardoned earlier this month! 11. \u201cHe said he was following up to see if I did what he had asked last time \u2013 getting out that he personally is not under investigation\u2026.He then added \u2018Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.\u2019 I did not reply, or ask him what he meant by \u2018that thing.\u2019\u201d What isn\u2019t said in this April 2017 phone call matters more than what is. Trump is obviously trying to dine out on the January dinner he and Comey had in which Trump asks for loyalty and Comey promises him honesty. Trump is forcing the matter, trying to take Comey\u2019s silence back then as a clear indicator that he would do what the President asked when he asked it \u2013 including \u201cgetting out there\u201d that Trump wasn\u2019t under investigation. Comey, again \u2013 as he did in that January dinner \u2013 chooses to stay silent rather than correct the President. Imagine how things might have been different if the FBI director ad said in this moment: \u201cMr. President, I pledged honesty, not loyalty. And that\u2019s all I can or will do\u201d?  It\u2019s possible Trump might have fired him sooner, sure, (the ax fell on Comey less than a month later) but the ambiguity that governed so much of the relationship between the two men would have been very different.",

            "article_content": "Here\u2019s something you don\u2019t hear too often these days: Republicans might have a shot at flipping a House district in Connecticut. Democratic Rep. Elizabeth Esty from Connecticut\u2019s 5th Congressional District is in hot water over how she handled abuse allegations made against one of her top aides in 2016. After learning of allegations of threats and physical assault made against her chief of staff, Esty kept the top aide on for three months before entering into a nondisclosure agreement with him and writing him a recommendation letter, CNN reported Friday. Esty said she won\u2019t resign, and Republicans currently lack a top recruit to challenge her in November\u2019s election. But there\u2019s still two months before the filing deadline, and a source familiar with the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s recruiting efforts told CNN the committee is reaching out to potential challengers. It won\u2019t be an easy battle for Republicans to win a seat given the national environment, but this is the type of district and scandal where Republicans could conceivably mount a strong challenge. Here\u2019s why: 1. Esty has shown weakness in the past When Esty was first elected in 2012, she won by just three percentage points. She\u2019s won reelection by increasing margins since that time as an incumbent, but that gives you an idea that she doesn\u2019t have a lock on this district. Now that Esty is suffering through a bit of a scandal, it wouldn\u2019t be too surprising if she loses the advantage normally associated with incumbency. 2. The partisan baseline in this district is only slightly Democratic One of the best measures for the potential competitiveness of a district is how it votes on the presidential level. Democrat Hillary Clinton only won here by 4 percentage points in 2016. That made the district the fifth most Republican district in New England that year. Four years earlier in 2012, the district was the second most Republican leaning in New England on the presidential level. 3. There are a lot of independents in the district Most partisans are locked into their choice no matter who the Democratic or Republican candidate is or what the candidate has done. The type of voter who would most likely be willing to switch sides in the wake of a scandal is one unaffiliated with either party. Although Democrats hold a slight lead over Republicans in party registration in Connecticut 5 (as reflected in the presidential vote in the district), the plurality (a little less than 45%) are unaffiliated. To put that percentage in perspective, a higher percentage of voters in Connecticut\u2019s 5th district are Independents than those in New Hampshire, which is considered one of the most independent states in the nation. Case-in-point to the district\u2019s independent nature: no Democratic gubernatorial candidate has come close to carrying the district since 2002. In 2014, for example, Republican Tom Foley carried the district by 8 percentage points, despite losing statewide by 3 points. 4. Connecticut\u2019s deeply unpopular Democratic governor Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy\u2019s approval ratings have hovered below 25% in polling over the last few months. Perhaps because of Malloy\u2019s lack of popularity, Democrats have not seen any noticeable improvement in Connecticut state legislative special elections versus the partisan baseline based off the last two presidential elections. That\u2019s far different than nationally, where Democrats are outperforming their partisan baseline by double-digits. Connecticut is, in other words, its own mini-pro GOP environment in a sea of Democrats doing well nationally. While federal elections are different than state elections, it seems conceivable the combination of an unpopular governor and a scandalized incumbent could be prove to be electoral poison for Esty. 5. #MeToo It\u2019s easy to say nothing matters in the age of President Donald Trump, but that ignores a lot of other recent history. We\u2019ve seen a Democrat win in Alabama because of sexual abuse allegations made against the Republican nominee, and we\u2019ve seen a Democratic US senator resign over allegations of sexual harassment. And now Esty is under fire for failing to protect one of her aides from harassment and shielding the accused harasser. A political science study of US senators (slightly different than a representative like Esty) found incumbents lose an average 6.5 percentage off their reelection vote share when they have a scandal involving immoral behavior. If that penalty is assessed to Esty, the race in Connecticut\u2019s 5th district could be quite competitive in November.",

            "article_content": "At the United Steelworkers rally for Conor Lamb, there are three union steelworkers supporting the Democrat in his bid against Republican Rick Saccone for a house seat in the special election in Pennsylvania 18th District. The trio are registered Democrats. Two voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. One, Edward Yorke, did not. \u201cI voted for Trump\u201d Yorke, 63, said. \u201cI feel the President is doing a fantastic job under the circumstances,\u201d Yorke added. \u201cIt\u2019s about time, we had to do something about the tariffs.\u201d RELATED: Track results from the special election for Pennsylvania\u2019s open House seat Voters like Yorke, who are registered Democrats and have supported Democrats in the past, gave Trump a victory by 20 points in the 18th District. But now, with polls suggesting a close race, the district\u2019s special election on Tuesday will be a test of Trump\u2019s popularity heading into the midterm elections and whether Democrats can compete in Trump country. Lamb must win over some of Trump\u2019s voters to succeed Tuesday. Trump won in this district in part because of his tough talk on trade. The 18th is the heart of steel country where nearly everyone knows someone who worked in the industry. His recent move imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum import is popular in the district: Saccone and Lamb have both expressed support for the tariffs and the United Steelworkers Union, which represents nearly 18,000 union members in the district is also on board. But it doesn\u2019t appear from speaking with union leaders and members here that Trump\u2019s popular move will necessarily translate to increased support for his chosen candidate, Saccone. Win or lose, Pennsylvania 18 likely forecasts bad news for the GOP in November \u201cConor Lamb would give me his ear,\u201d Yorke. said \u201cAs far as Saccone, I don\u2019t feel comfortable and I would tell the President that also: \u2018Sorry, I wish I could help you out, but Saccone doesn\u2019t impress me at all.\u2019\u201d Tim Waters, the political director for the United Steelworkers Union, \u201cWe applaud the President for what he did and for drawing a line in the sand. It\u2019s what he said he was going to do and it needs to be done. This is not a political issue.\u201d The steelworkers union has been joined by members from the teachers, hotel, and postal workers unions in getting out the vote for Lamb. Together they have 80,000 union members in the 18th District, which translates to that many potential voters. For the past few months, members have been canvassing neighborhoods in the district \u2013 sometimes four or five times \u2013 and knocking doors of other members. Denny Cregut is a former steelworker who now works for the United Steelworkers Union. He and his wife Kelly spent the weekend before the election visiting dozens of households to remind people to vote. In an hour, just two people came to answer the door. Waters believes direct voter contact is a winning strategy. Soon after Lamb announced his candidacy, he met with labor unions and visited local steel mills and processing facilities. Lamb opposes so-called \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws, which prevent unions from mandating dues payments from members they represent. Saccone told reporters Saturday that the \u201cright-to-work thing is always a tricky thing\u201d but that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for unions if they were willing to compete. \u201cRick Saccone was endorsed wholeheartedly by the right-to-work committee and would probably do away with unions if he could,\u201d Waters said. Trump touts GOP candidate \u2014 and talks drug dealers, 2020 and Oprah in whirlwind rally Jason White, who spent two years working in the coal mining industry and was a part of the United Mine Workers of America, which also endorsed Lamb, sees it differently. White was a Democrat until 2012 when he switched parties, and now he\u2019s supporting Saccone. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard Rick say he\u2019s against unions,\u201d White said. \u201cI think he is just pro giving someone a choice.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think union leadership has the backing of its members like it used to. \u201cI think they\u2019re breaking with leadership,\u201d White said. \u201cIf you talk to anybody on the side, and go behind closed doors and have discussions, you get a pretty good gist of how people feel.\u201d That could prove tricky for the union who are hoping their members turn out in high numbers. The union hopes their members will make up 30% of the electorate on Tuesday. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve seen in the recent years that the endorsement from union leadership doesn\u2019t carry as much weight as it used to,\u201d said Chris Bonneau, a political scientist from the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a conscious breaking from the leadership just so much as the leadership doesn\u2019t have as much of sway or sway over its members.\u201d Someone who still has sway in southwest Pennsylvania \u2013 Donald Trump. He drew a packed crowd to his rally with Saccone on Saturday, with some supporters having to be turned away. \u201cI think people appreciate what he\u2019s done,\u201d said White. \u201cAnd you have Rick Saccone, who supports that agenda. So to go against the party lines and go against that agenda doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. And this tariff is kind of an exclamation point for how people feel.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Beth Oppenheim is a researcher at the Centre for European Reform in London. Follow her on Twitter @Beth_Oppenheim. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. The UK\u2019s 2016 Brexit referendum was meant to put the vexed question of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe to bed forever \u2013 it didn\u2019t. The debate about the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU has continued to rage since Britons voted 52% to 48% to leave the bloc. Fears of a damaging, haphazard Brexit are growing with every day that passes without a withdrawal agreement. Hopes of a Brexit breakthrough at this week\u2019s European leaders\u2019 summit have been dashed. So \u201cRemainers\u201d \u2013 as pro-EU supporters are known \u2013 are now throwing their weight behind a growing campaign for a rerun \u2013 the People\u2019s Vote. They\u2019re hoping to draw tens of thousands from around the country to another march through London on October 20 to press their case. But the chances of a new EU referendum are slim: there are substantial political and practical obstacles, and time is running out. EU leaders prepared to extend UK's Brexit transition period The arguments for and against are finely balanced. People\u2019s Vote supporters contend that voters should get a say on the final Brexit deal, especially as it is likely to be different to what was promised two years ago. The 2016 referendum campaign atmosphere was febrile and dishonest \u2013 some even suspect foreign interference. Furthermore, as the negotiations to leave have worn on, the difficult trade-offs involved with leaving the EU have become much clearer to Britons. There is a growing demand for a new referendum from politicians across the political spectrum, including from the governing Conservatives. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Deputy Prime Ministers Nick Clegg and Michael Heseltine made an intervention this week in the German newspaper Die Welt, calling for a referendum. One millionaire owner of a well-known plumbing company has put up bright yellow billboards around London exclaiming: \u201cBollocks to Brexit \u2013 it\u2019s not a done deal\u201d. Bookmakers have the odds of another referendum at 2/1. However, Prime Minister Theresa May \u2013 who campaigned to stay in the EU \u2013 has said a further referendum would be a betrayal of British democracy. Both Mrs May and the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn say the original result should be respected and fear punishment at the ballot box by Leave voters if they don\u2019t. The 2016 plebiscite attracted many who felt forgotten by the political establishment. EU membership is an incredibly complex and emotive question. This toxic combination made the referendum vulnerable to oversimplification and populist rhetoric. Such a weighty issue should never have been put to a simple in-out vote in the first place \u2013 so repeating the exercise would make no sense. And ultimately, there\u2019s no guarantee that a new referendum would produce a different result In practical terms, the time needed to hold a new referendum has all but run out. Staging a new vote would take a minimum of 22 weeks including legislation and campaigning. But fierce debate about the wording of the question and other details suggests it would take longer. It is not clear whether the choice would be between versions of Brexit or whether the ballot paper would include an option to stay in the EU. Some have suggested a three-option vote, while others have considered a two-stage referendum. At the very least, the government would need to have a prospective Brexit deal for people to vote on \u2013 and that might not be clear until the end of the year. That means it would impossible to stage a referendum before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. The UK could seek an extension to the two-year legal process for leaving the EU, but that would require the unanimous agreement of the other 27 EU member-states. With six months to go, Brexit is still baffling A short extension of a few weeks would be manageable, but consensus on anything longer would be much more difficult as it would disrupt the European Parliament elections at the end of May 2019. The European Parliament has already agreed to re-allocate the UK\u2019s seats to other countries, including France, which has proved tough in the Brexit negotiations. The prime ministers of Malta and the Czech Republic have voiced their support for a new EU referendum, but other EU leaders have said they respect the original result even though they are unhappy about it. The EU is already struggling to respond to the rising tides of Euroskepticism on the continent \u2013 a second lost referendum could help the populists. There is also little sign that EU officials are preparing for a possible re-run vote. Even if the practical obstacles for a new referendum could be overcome, there is no political will to do so. May has repeatedly ruled one out. There is support for one in the Labour Party, but it would far prefer an election. A perfect Brexit storm could create the right conditions - if the prime minister failed to agree an exit deal with the EU, or if her deal was rejected by parliament, it might become an attractive option to hand the issue back to the electorate to decide. But the last time Theresa May changed her mind about holding a vote in 2017 she lost her party a parliamentary majority \u2013 she may not be so keen to do it again.",

The views expressed in this commentary are solely the author\u2019s. You can find all episodes of Brooke Baldwin\u2019s \u201cAmerican Woman in Politics\u201d here. Cara McClure explains her decision this way. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on running, and then I woke up that morning feeling guilty \u2026 because I have so much to offer.\u201d McClure once battled homelessness as a single mother. But her determination and grit through the years earned her a job as a grassroots organizer, a home for her family and, eventually, gave her the nerve to run for office. Last fall, she was one of the thousands of black women who helped deliver victory for Doug Jones \u2013 the first Democrat to represent Alabama in the US Senate in 21 years. And that got her thinking: Why should she merely support someone else? Why not be the change herself. She\u2019s far from alone. There\u2019s an unprecedented wave of female candidates \u2013 many of them first-timers \u2013 running for office up and down the ballot this year. So far, 61 women have run for governor in 2018, nearly doubling the record of female candidates set in 1994, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers. Women have also set a new record in the race for seats in the US House of Representatives, with a total of 185 women \u2013 Democrats and Republicans combined \u2013 landing a major-party nomination to run. And since Donald Trump was elected President, 36,000 women have expressed interest in running for office, according to Stephanie Schriock of Emily\u2019s List, a progressive pro-choice organization that recruits and funds female candidates. Think about that: 36,000 women. In Texas, that includes Gina Ortiz Jones, who is running for Congress. If she wins, she\u2019ll be the first Filipina-American to do so \u2013 ever. She\u2019s also an Iraq war veteran, first-generation American and a lesbian. Dismayed by the current political climate, Ortiz Jones felt called to step up and serve. \u201cWe\u2019re being tested,\u201d Ortiz Jones said. \u201cThe real cost is in 5-10 years from now when I\u2019m looking in the mirror: \u2018Did I do everything I could do?\u2019 If the answer isn\u2019t yes, then I failed \u2013 this country has given so much to me.\u201d She Could Become the Country's First Native American Governor Equally motivated to serve her community, Paulette Jordan in Idaho has faced down a barrage of predictably dismissive comments. \u201cI\u2019ve heard: \u2018She\u2019ll never do it,\u2019 \u2018she doesn\u2019t stand a chance,\u2019 \u2018never in hell,\u2019 \u2018she doesn\u2019t have the money,\u2019 \u2018why would she run?\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019s wasting her time,\u2019\u201d Jordan said. \u201cPeople think it needs to be a white male.\u201d If anything, those comments have made Jordan even more determined to make history and become the country\u2019s first female Native American governor. I created the series \u201cAmerican Woman in Politics\u201d to learn more about McClure, Ortiz Jones and Jordan \u2013 to lean into women who are what I like to call, \u201cextraordinary ordinary women.\u201d These are women from all corners of the country whose names you might not know but whose stories so many Americans will be able to relate to. They\u2019ve made sacrifices and dared to do more than just complain about politics around the dinner table. They jumped into the deep end, learning how to raise money, create a campaign message and reach voters for the first time in their lives. These women told me over and over: \u201cWe have too much to lose.\u201d As millennial women lean left, this GOP candidate took a stand for the right Who surprised me the most? Christina Hagan, a millennial candidate in Ohio and ardent Trump supporter who was running for Congress. There are three times as many Democrats as Republican women running for office this year. \u201cThe Democrat Party has more embraced the idea of being forward with gender, forward with diversity, while the Republican Party is still a lot of old white men,\u201d Hagan, who lost her primary election in May, is quick to point out. Hagan is underrepresented in what she refers to as an \u201can old boy\u2019s club.\u201d She said that needs to change. She\u2019s absolutely right. I dedicated my first American Woman series to my mother. She and millions in her generation felt they couldn\u2019t use their voices, but they taught their daughters they must use theirs. I dedicate this second series to you, the women reading this right now. Perhaps you\u2019ve flirted with running for student government or school board or Congress. Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to be elected to US Congress, once famously said that \u201cIf they don\u2019t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.\u201d Watch these episodes. Be inspired. Rise up. Act. Soon enough, you won\u2019t need to bother with a folding chair. Clarification: This story was updated to reflect Christina Hagan\u2019s primary loss.",

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Early Sunday afternoon President Donald Trump elevated Twitter to a virtual Cabinet position in his administration. He used it, rather than the attorney general, to order a possible criminal investigation of a counterintelligence operation conducted by the Department of Justice and the FBI. The President tweeted: \u201cI hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration.\u201d I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration! This may be the first Department of Justice criminal investigation ordered via Twitter feed. Given the importance of a presidential decision regarding a possible criminal investigation, the use of Twitter was completely inappropriate. It trivializes the entire process. What\u2019s next in the presidential communication arsenal, the use of Facebook and Instagram with photos? One would have expected a conference with the deputy attorney general so that the implications of such an important decision could be weighed and evaluated. Ordering such an investigation via Twitter is a disgraceful exercise of prosecutorial power by the President of the United States. We can only hope that Trump doesn\u2019t lead the nation into war via Twitter before consulting with the proper military advisers. The US Constitution designates the president as the nation\u2019s chief executive \u2013 in charge of all agencies in the executive branch of the federal government. Since the Department of Justice and the FBI are part of the executive branch, the president has final authority over the operation of those agencies. As such, in the absence of a provable \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d to obstruct justice or engage in unlawful activity, his order to initiate an investigation of the FBI and Justice Department as outlined in his tweet would be presumptively legal. In modern times, though, most presidents have taken a hands-off approach with respect to specific criminal investigations in a deliberate effort to keep them out of partisan politics and to preserve public respect for the integrity of federal law enforcement authorities. Trump is succeeding at poisoning the conversation about Mueller That sensible precedent has been shattered by Trump\u2019s unapologetic criticism and suggestions regarding ongoing investigations and the investigators themselves. He has repeatedly attacked his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, calling him weak and disloyal, among other things. He has directed similar diatribes at high ranking members of the FBI as well as FBI investigative teams probing Russian interference in the American presidential election. While the President constantly urges a quick conclusion to the Mueller investigation with the mantra of  \u201cno evidence of collusion,\u201d and \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d his Twitter directive Sunday may actually extend and complicate the probe. 'SNL' hits a comedic nerve with its Trump/Sopranos skit Surprisingly Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mueller and the Russia investigation since Sessions\u2019 recusal, immediately complied with the President\u2019s tweetstorm. Rather than waiting for the President to make his \u201cdemand\u201d official, as promised in the Twitter feed, Rosenstein pulled the trigger immediately, ordering the inspector general to investigate the matter. Ironically, the call for a new investigation occurred on the same day that presidential \u201cpro bono\u201d counsel Rudolph Giuliani told the New York Times that the Mueller team had hinted that the \u201cRussia Investigation\u201d might end as early as September if the President is willing to submit to questioning by Mueller on a limited number of topics. The presidential call for such an investigation of the Department of Justice and the FBI, if taken seriously, would undoubtedly have required the appointment of a second independent counsel with Mueller-like powers to avoid a clear conflict of interest. This job is far too big for the DOJ inspector general\u2019s office which normally investigates relatively minor internal agency waste and misconduct claims. Rosenstein may be hoping that the immediate inspector general referral will result in a swift investigation and closure of the matter. Part of the DOJ and the FBI \u2018s job is after all the conduct of counterintelligence investigations and, if warranted by the evidence, the warning of presidential candidates that the Russians might try to infiltrate their campaigns to influence the American election. One would think that Trump would be grateful rather than suspicious about the warning. Mr. President, don't let Kim take advantage of you Rosenstein\u2019s swift referral to the inspector general is unlikely to buy him much peace. Trump has repeatedly telegraphed his intense dislike for Rosenstein who, after all, is the person who appointed Mueller. Trump has previously attacked Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Rosenstein\u2019s choice for the investigation, calling him \u201cObama\u2019s guy,\u201d and criticizing a prior referral to the IG\u2019s Office by Jeff Sessions. Though widely respected as thorough and fair by those in the legal profession, Horowitz has no credibility with Trump. In the end, Trump\u2019s attempt to embarrass his own Department of Justice and FBI is likely to wound only his own presidency. If Inspector General Horowitz makes the highly unlikely finding that the DOJ and the FBI acted criminally in their conduct of a counterintelligence operation related to the Trump campaign, a criminal referral will be necessary. Since the DOJ can\u2019t prosecute itself, a new outside, independent counsel would have to be appointed as Mueller, too, would have a conflict of interest. Undoubtedly, some of the FISA warrants used to gather information in the early stages of his investigation were very likely supported by the counterintelligence operation now under investigation. With the appointment of a new independent counsel whose job would necessarily include investigating the work of Mueller, the President will have created the bizarre spectacle of dueling independent counsels. In the firestorm which would follow, public confidence in the DOJ and the FBI would be shattered.  Sunday\u2019s Twitter order to commence a new investigation to smear the Obama administration is likely to backfire and extend the Mueller investigation.  It may also cause Mueller to look at an interesting new idea \u2013 was the presidential order to commence such a frivolous investigation itself really an attempt to block the progress of the Mueller investigation and obstruct justice? It might be the one piece of evidence needed by the independent counsel to prove corrupt intent as required by the obstruction of justice statute. The law of unintended consequences is a dangerous thing.",

Follow him @aarondmiller2. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Benjamin Netanyahu has now used up at least 13 of his nine lives, dodging indictments over fraud and breach of trust on at least one occasion as Israeli Prime Minister \u2013 and staging one of the greatest comebacks in Israel\u2019s political history by becoming Prime Minister (again) in 2009 and not letting go. Should he manage to survive until 2019, he would surpass Israel\u2019s greatest leader David Ben-Gurion in longevity. But will he? After a yearlong investigation, Israeli police concluded this week \u201cthere is sufficient evidence\u201d to indict Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in two cases that boil down to accepting material gifts and favorable newspaper coverage in exchange for possible political quid pro quos to wealthy benefactors. Netanyahu faces the political crisis of his life Two additional cases of far greater severity are pending, though Netanyahu is not a suspect in either of them. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, saying of the accusations that \u201cthere will not be anything because there is nothing.\u201d The investigation will now move to Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit and his staff, where a decision will be made as to whether there is sufficient evidence to indict. Plenty of analysts and pundits have lost money betting against Netanyahu. I remember on the eve of his election for a first term in May 1996, remarking to my colleague Dennis Ross that there was no way Netanyahu could become Prime Minister. I was wrong. Many have been wrong since in underestimating his survival skills. Netanyahu is no speed bump in Israeli politics. But is this the beginning of the end for him? Much could change before the year ends, but here are some observations about the swirling storm that is engulfing Israeli politics. Anyone \u2013 friend or foe \u2013 expecting the Prime Minister to be gone yesterday ought to lie down and wait quietly until the feeling passes. Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who spent time in prison for fraud and bribery, resigned in 2008, even before the police charged him. Netanyahu, who has maintained that there will be nothing because there is nothing, will not go down without a fight. It took eight months before Olmert was indicted, and he remained as head of a caretaker government until early elections were called. Ronen Bergman: Middle East on the brink of war Any decision to indict will be weighed seriously by the attorney general on the basis of whether he could get a conviction. Not to convict would be a major blow to Israel\u2019s political and legal system. In the meantime, Netanyahu will continue to govern and to demonstrate both his authority and more important his indispensability, particularly on the security side, where he will tout his experience in the face of many challenges. The idea that the Prime Minister would intentionally create a \u201cwag the dog\u201d situation and take Israel to war as a distraction and diversion is remote. But he will certainly make the case that the country cannot afford to do without him over some gifts of cigars and champagne at such a critical moment. An indictment on serious charges \u2013 e.g., bribery, breach of trust, fraud \u2013 would force the issue into the court of public and political opinion. At a minimum, an indictment would likely trigger new elections called either by Netanyahu or by one of his adversaries. For now, the coalition appears stable \u2013 though Netanyahu\u2019s rivals will be watching closely to see how the legal process unfolds \u2013 at least until the attorney general makes a decision to indict or not. Israeli police find 'sufficient evidence' to indict Benjamin Netanyahu Netanyahu has crossed many of his former partners, some of whom \u2013 such as rival Naftali Bennett, or Moshe Kahlon \u2013 have political aspirations of their own, and if Netanyahu is indicted, the current government will almost certainly not survive. It\u2019s always possible that the coalition might rally around him, but it\u2019s hard to imagine a situation where Netanyahu could remain Prime Minister if he goes on trial on corruption charges. The end of Netanyahu does not mean the beginning of a serious peace process. Netanyahu likely never saw himself as the Israeli Prime Minister who was going to be the father of Palestinian statehood, based on a political division of Jerusalem, dismantling of settlements, and borders of a Palestinian state kept close to June 1967 lines. He has proven himself highly risk-averse on matters of war and peacemaking. And his self-image and ideology make it difficult to imagine he\u2019d ever agree to anything close to the current Palestinian narrative. Still, he\u2019s not the most right-wing leader in his coalition, and is indeed flanked by others \u2013 particularly Bennett \u2013 much tougher than he. But running on the peace process in the current climate \u2013 framed by violence, a dysfunctional Palestinian national movement and a weak Mahmoud Abbas \u2013 hardly seems like a winning hand. The issue in Israeli politics is who can put together a viable coalition. As the old saying goes, a leader without followers is just a guy out for a walk. Netanyahu defends son after secret tape airs To identify the peace process as a key issue in an election, should Netanyahu meet his political demise, you\u2019d need some real drama: a clear choice before the Israeli public of a popular candidate whom Israelis can trust on security and an offer from Palestinian or Arab partners of real peace and security. And that\u2019s a stretch. In fact, Palestinians now worry that under pressure of investigations, Netanyahu may want to solidify his ties to the right and take action on the ground that might foreclose once and for all the possibility of a two-state solution. There is the matter of the emerging Trump peace initiative. In an effort to support Netanyahu, the Trump administration might roll out its ultimate deal on terms likely to make Israel\u2019s acceptance possible and aimed at boosting the US-Israeli relationship. The Palestinians would almost certainly reject it, but it would reaffirm that Netanyahu holds the key to managing ties with Washington. And if several Arab states talked about it positively, it would also boost his stock. On the other hand, the probability that the Trump plan is almost certain to fail might give the administration an excuse to delay it given the unsettled situation in Israel. Netanyahu has dominated Israeli politics for most of the past decade. It\u2019s illogical to assume his departure would not create a new and dynamic political reality. But what kind of reality is another matter. With the deaths of Shimon Peres and Ariel Sharon \u2013 the last of Israel\u2019s founding generation \u2013 Israel faces its own kind of leadership transition and challenges. And a younger generation of Prime Ministers \u2013 Olmert (recently out of prison), Ehud Barak (deeply mistrusted) and Netanyahu (maybe soon to be indicted) haven\u2019t really risen to replace them. Former speaker of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, used to compare Peres to an evergreen tree \u2013 stately and impressive, but underneath, nothing grows. Netanyahu has clearly and willfully groomed no successors, and has in fact alienated most of his former Likud colleagues. Still, it is possible that Likud might fare better in the next  election without Netanyahu. Benjamin Netanyahu Fast Facts Who on the right would replace him? And who has the political smarts, the stamina and security credentials to motivate the Likud base and broaden it to take votes away from the center right? Several members of Likud would like the job. But who among them would be electable and able to form a stable governing coalition? As for the Labor Party and its leader, Avi Gabbay, a self-made millionaire who seems able to relate to working-class Israelis, and whom The Guardian described as the Israeli Emmanuel Macron \u2013 who really knows? Labor hasn\u2019t won an election in 18 years and right now is polling third after Likud and the center-right party Yesh Atid, headed by another possible prime ministerial candidate, Yair Lapid \u2013 whom some consider a front-runner and who testified in the  ongoing investigation against Netanyahu. In any event, it\u2019s far too early to speculate on who might win the prime ministerial sweepstakes whenever Netanyahu does leave the scene. It\u2019s possible \u2013 though not likely \u2013 that Netanyahu somehow survives. If he doesn\u2019t, perhaps the change and transition will produce new leaders and real choices. Indeed, it\u2019s still way too early to predict the course of the investigation, let alone the future of Israeli politics. But one thing is certain: Buckle your seat belts. The politics of an already volatile Middle East are about to become more turbulent and uncertain still.",

            "article_content": "It was Saturday morning, but the crowds at Poughkeepsie\u2019s train station in upstate New York looked more like weekday rush hour. The assorted posters signaled the multitude of reasons people were heading to the Women\u2019s March in New York City, some 80 miles down the train line hugging the Hudson River: #MeToo. I Stand With Planned Parenthood. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. I live in a s***hole country. As the 8:51 approached, organizers shouted directions over the brass marching band clamoring in the middle of platform, aptly named Tin Horn Uprising. Participants in this Hudson Valley \u201cpeace train\u201d were to board the same car so they could sing, chant and build momentum as more people joined them on stops to New York\u2019s Grand Central Station. This wasn\u2019t Maura O\u2019Meara\u2019s first time wrangling crowds. One year ago, she helped organize a caravan of buses from the Hudson Valley region to Washington for the inaugural Women\u2019s March. Back then, she said she was sad, angry and still in shock over US President Donald Trump\u2019s election. Going into this year\u2019s march, however, she said she feels more hopeful than she did in 2017, despite the tumult of Trump\u2019s first year in office. \u201cPeople are paying attention now in a way they haven\u2019t before,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s only good things that can come from that.\u201d One year ago, she marched. This year, she\u2019s a councilwoman O\u2019Meara has seen it in her community. After the DC march, another Hudson Valley demonstrator decided to run for office in O\u2019Meara\u2019s hometown, and won. Now deputy mayor of the village of New Paltz, K.T. Tobin said she shared O\u2019Meara\u2019s hope even as the administration continues to disgust her. That\u2019s why Tobin going to march again this year, to continue building momentum, she said. \u201cThe need is even more urgent.\u201d A post shared by Emanuella Grinberg (@grinsli) As the train left Poughkeepsie, organizers passed out leaflets with chants while others put the finishing touches on signs. The train rumbled south, frozen chunks of the Hudson visible through its windows. For many, it was their second Women\u2019s March, but not so for Ellen Marx. Trump\u2019s election was too \u201cdemoralizing\u201d to get her off her feet last year, despite a lifelong activist streak. As a college student in the 1960s, she protested the Vietnam War. Then, in the 1970s, she fought for the passage of the Equal Rights Act. In the 1980s, Iran-Contra was her issue. \u201cThose were single-issue times,\u201d said Marx, 64. \u201cThis is all-encompassing.\u201d Why Women\u2019s March organizers are turning their attention to Nevada She might have sat out this year\u2019s march if not for her child sitting across the aisle. Moss Sherman, 19, identifies as gender-neutral and goes by the pronouns they and them. Just the other day, Sherman said someone on the street shouted \u201cqueer\u201d at them in a derogatory manner. The memory of it brings tears to Sherman\u2019s eyes. \u201cTrump has brought so much fear to so many people,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI just want my identity to feel supported.\u201d Unlike other protest signs bearing strident messages, Sherman said they chose a personal message to encourage empathy for all. A post shared by Emanuella Grinberg (@grinsli) \u201cI am hurting and I know you are, too,\u201d it read. \u201cOur struggles may differ but I love you and support you endlessly. Together we may overcome!\u201d In the background, as the train pulled out of Peekskill, O\u2019Meara broke into the classic protest chant, \u201cThis land is your land.\u201d She clapped and clapped, and others joined her. From the seat behind Sherman, Merrill Sunderland leaned forward. She acknowledged that the group she belonged to, League of Women Voters, struggled to be more inclusive of people like Sherman, in part because of its name. \u201cWe need to make clear this is not just a women\u2019s movement,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a movement for anyone\u2019s who\u2019s suffering under this administration.\u201d A post shared by Jessica Moskowitz (@jessmoskowitz) In a folder in her lap, she held a pile of reproductions of a League of Women voting poster from 1907. Her reasons for marching this year are the same, she said \u2013 as a Unitarian Universalist, activism and social justice are part of her world view. On a personal level, the camaraderie of a march fortifies; it helps her deal with \u201cthe strain of living in an uncertain political climate,\u201d she said. Sunderland joined the crowd in song as it switched to another mainstay modified for today\u2019s event. This little light of mine, I\u2019m gonna let it shine At the women\u2019s march, I\u2019m gonna let it shine\u2026 At the Tarrytown stop, the car swelled with more adults carrying signs and a handful of children with rainbow hair. Buoyed by the growing crowds, O\u2019Meara belted out an improvised call-and-response at the top of her lungs: \u201cLook out New York\u2026 we\u2019re coming to town!\u201d The Hudson Valley peace train to #WomensMarch2018 NYC was bumping by the time it reached Tarrytown. Chants of \"show me what democracy looks like\" and \"at the Womens March I'm gonna let it shine.\" pic.twitter.com/d195lZEd88 A group of women wearing red T-shirts of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America filled the aisle. One of them, Patricia Colella, said her reasons for marching were the same as last year but had grown more urgent in light of the spate of mass shootings that dominated 2017, she said. As crowds filled the aisles, the conductor came through and asked them to move to another car. By then, the other cars had filled and there was nowhere for them to go. As the train pulled into Grand Central Station, O\u2019Meara issued one more call-and-response in honor of Rep. Maxine Waters, who immortalized the phrase last year: Reclaiming our time! The peace train members made their way through the terminal and out to 42nd Street. They walked toward Sixth Avenue for a preview of the march route, still waving their signs and chanting. Outside the train their ranks seemed thinner as they mixed with pedestrians near Bryant Park. Some stopped to take pictures of their signs while others impatiently pushed past them. \u201cThis feels different from last DC,\u201d O\u2019Meara noted. \u201cLast year, the crowds stretched for miles. Here it\u2019s like business as usual.\u201d A post shared by Emanuella Grinberg (@grinsli) The mood shifted yet again as they approached Central Park, where a pre-march rally had begun. Janelle Peotter, a member of Tin Horn Uprising, the brass band from Hudson Valley, raised her sign for a photo op: \u201cWell behaved women rarely make history.\u201d Peotter, 58, has a daughter who lives in Hawaii. She was texting with her the other weekend when a false nuclear threat went off there. In those 38 minutes, she said she never felt more scared in her life. This morning, she said, \u201cI texted my three adult children and said I\u2019m marching for your future.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Moskowitz and Brynn Gingras contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A Democratic measure aimed at eliminating short-term health care plans that don\u2019t cover pre-existing conditions failed in the Senate on Wednesday in a tied vote of 50-50. Maine Sen. Susan Collins was the sole Republican to vote for the measure, put forth by Democrats. The resolution was aimed at rebuffing a Trump administration rule that allowed some plans not to require coverage of pre-existing conditions, the latest action from the minority party\u2019s push to focus on the issue of health care going into the midterms. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin used the Congressional Review Act to force a vote to overturn the Trump administration rule to expand short-term insurance plans. Forty-nine Democratic senators supported the resolution and they would have needed an additional Republican vote \u2013 besides Collins \u2013 to reach the 51-vote threshold for the measure to pass, though the GOP-controlled House would likely not have acted on the legislation. That made the series of events Wednesday morning a largely symbolic vote aimed at forcing moderate Republicans to possibly take a politically difficult vote on the record. Short-term health plans work... but they aren't for everyone Short-term health plans don\u2019t have to adhere to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s regulations that protect people with pre-existing conditions. These plans can deny coverage or charge higher premiums to Americans based on their medical histories. And they don\u2019t have to provide comprehensive coverage. The Trump administration made it easier to buy these plans \u2014 allowing people to buy coverage for just under a year, versus the 90-day limit imposed by the Obama administration. \u201cThe Trump administration is rewriting the rules on guaranteed health care protections that millions of Americans depend on,\u201d said Baldwin, who\u2019s up for re-election this year in a state President Donald Trump won in 2016, in a statement before the vote. \u201cThese junk insurance plans can deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and don\u2019t have to provide essential health services like prescription drugs, emergency room visits and maternity care.\u201d Baldwin also touted in her statement that more than 20 health organizations, like the American Heart Association and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, supported her effort. Collins cited the lack of protections for those with pre-existing conditions in a statement explaining her vote. \u201cShort-Term Limited Duration plans do not provide protections for enrollees who suffer from pre-existing conditions,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAs I have often emphasized, it is essential that individuals who suffer from pre-existing conditions are covered. At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that many individuals lack an affordable health insurance option. The underlying flaw in the Affordable Care Act is that it does not provide affordable coverage. But I believe this flaw can be addressed without jeopardizing protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.\u201d The Congressional Review Act is a law that Republicans have used extensively since Trump came into office to overturn Obama-era regulations. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who voted against her party to protect the Affordable Care Act in 2017, told CNN that she would not be supporting Baldwin\u2019s resolution. GOP leaders blasted the Democratic proposal in advance of the vote, saying it would take away a low-cost insurance option for families who Republicans argue were hurt by the Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as Obamacare. \u201cSurely, they must have a better answer than snatching away one of the remaining options that some Americans still prefer to anything Democrats have been able to come up,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said before the vote.  \u201cOur constituents deserve more options, not fewer.\u201d \u201cI think the most important thing to remember is that Obamacare is not the only way to get pre-existing condition coverage. There are better ways to do it,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said in advance of the vote.  \u201cThat is what they would like to get people to buy into, and it\u2019s just fundamentally not true.\u201d But Democrats, still stinging from the bitter fight over the confirmation of now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, are emphasizing this new rallying cry during the final four week push to the midterms, with one senior Democratic aide telling CNN, \u201cThe vote this week puts Republicans on record, and is just the start of our relentless focus on health care down the stretch.\u201d In remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the Trump administration\u2019s rule on short-term health care plans \u201cfundamentally misguided policy.\u201d \u201cAll of my colleagues should vote for this, but I suspect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a different idea because ever since taking control of congress and the presidency, Republicans have deliberately, relentlessly undermined Americans\u2019 health care,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Sen. Susan Collins was already one of the Democrats\u2019 biggest Senate targets in 2020 when she took to the Senate floor Friday to announce she would vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. But Collins\u2019 decision to back the Supreme Court nominee after he was accused of sexual assault was instantly controversial with not only the hundreds of activists who flooded the Capitol this week but also with Democratic activists in her home state of Maine who have opposed Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination for weeks. By the time she finished her speech, Democrats in Maine had begun speculating who might challenge the moderate Republican. And progressive activists are pouring in money to fund the eventual challenger, raising millions of dollars online to unseat Collins. Susan Collins: 'I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh' A half dozen Democratic operatives and lawmakers in Maine raised several names of potential candidates who are openly considering the job, including Chellie Pingree, the Democrat representing Southern Maine in the US House; Sara Gideon, the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives; Seth Berry, a former member of the Maine House of Representatives; and Hannah Pingree, a former speaker of the Maine House and Chellie Pingree\u2019s daughter. Some Maine Democrats also mentioned Jared Golden, the veteran running in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District this year, as a possible challenger whether he wins or loses the race, as well as Emily Cain, a top operative at the Democratic group EMILY\u2019s List and two-time congressional candidate from Maine. Maine\u2019s Democratic bench is not very deep, said two operatives, so the seat could also be a chance for the party to draw in a national figure or political outsider. Susan Rice, the former national security adviser for President Barack Obama, caused a stir Friday afternoon when she tweeted \u201cMe\u201d when another former Obama official asked who could challenge Collins in 2020. Me https://t.co/93qNxN7Ky9 Rice does have a home in Maine, a source said, and her family has ties to the state. In a follow-up tweet, Rice said: \u201cMany thanks for the encourgement (sic). I\u2019m not making any announcements. Like so many Americans, I am deeply disappointed in Senator Collins\u2019 vote for Kavanaugh. Maine and America deserve better.\u201d Brian Fallon, a former aide to Hillary Clinton who\u2019s the head of a group that aimed to sink Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, suggested former Planned Parenthood head Cecile Richards for the job. \u201cDoesnt @CecileRichards have a home in Maine?\u201d Fallon asked. Richards does in fact own a home in the state. Collins\u2019 speech, where she decried the process to get Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination through the Senate and slammed outside Democratic groups for their actions throughout it, so animated Democrats in Maine that many wasted no time to tout that they were openly considering a run. \u201cI would certainly not rule it out,\u201d Berry, who spent a decade representing rural Maine, told CNN. \u201cThere are others who are equally qualified and I would want to look at the whole field before I make a decision, but clearly Sen. Collins made a choice that did not reflect the people of Maine and our values.\u201d Gideon also leaned into a possible run minutes after Collins\u2019 speech wrapped up, posting to her Facebook page that she will consider challenging the Republican. In an interview with CNN afterward, she called Collins\u2019 plan to back Kavanaugh \u201ca final straw\u201d but not the only reason. \u201cI am considering it,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a very important responsibility from now until November 6 to re-elect a Democratic majority (in the Maine House), so I am laser-focused on that in the next four and a half weeks. However, this is something I am seriously considering and once we get past November 6 then I will be really laying out everything and making a decision.\u201d Gideon added: \u201cAs a woman, it is absolutely fundamentally tied to my belief about what he will do as a justice on women\u2019s reproductive rights, but further than that, when the testimony of Dr. Ford came out, it really did become something different.\u201d The Maine Republican Party stood firmly behind Collins after her speech, calling the remarks the \u201cgold standard of speeches in explaining her vote and showing how a nominee should be evaluated.\u201d But it seemed shortly after the remarks that Collins\u2019 defense of Kavanaugh invigorated Democrats in the state and nationwide. \u201cThis will galvanize Democrats to come together and look for a strong challenger to Sen. Collins,\u201d Joe Baldacci, a former mayor of Bangor, said in an interview. \u201cI think these votes really go to the heart of important progressive issues and how they affect Maine families, and I think this vote will galvanize Democrats in Maine.\u201d One thing was clear after Collins\u2019 speech: Whoever runs will be well funded. As the senator spoke, grass-roots progressive donors poured money \u2013 more than $1 million, according to organizers \u2013 into an online effort led by the Be A Hero PAC designed to raise money for a potential Democratic challenger. When its Crowdpac site crashed, the group set up an account on Act Blue, another fundraising website, and said it likely crossed the $3 million threshold by the time Collins finished her remarks. Back in 2014, the last time she ran for re-election, Collins spent more than $5.5 million. Her opponent, Democrat Shenna Bellows, raised only $2.4 million. If Collins decided to oppose Kavanaugh, the pledges would have been canceled. But the group\u2019s president, Liz Jaff, said that with Collins\u2019 announcement, \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to get charged tomorrow.\u201d The \u201cBe A Hero\u201d effort had picked up steam, and appeared in headlines, earlier in the confirmation process when Collins derided it as \u201cbribery.\u201d The money, which has been raised legally, is likely to change the early contours of the primary to replace her. \u201cNobody ever goes in that early, nobody is even thinking about, and what we\u2019ve just done is set it up for a candidate to legitimately have a chance,\u201d Jaff said. \u201cStarting capital for any person running for Senate in Maine hasn\u2019t even been close to what we just raised. So I think what happens is suddenly you will have a bunch of people who say, \u2018I could never have raised that money. It\u2019s just going to be too tough,\u2019 are suddenly looking at a pool of capital they could have access to.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Progressive insurgents were turned back by the Democratic establishment on Thursday in Delaware, where Sen. Tom Carper fended off a spirited \u2013 but perhaps fatally underfunded \u2013 primary challenge from the left by first-time candidate Kerri Evelyn Harris, CNN projects. Ayanna Pressley's win shows just being liberal isn't enough in today's Democratic Party The governor for eight years before entering the Senate in 2001, and the state\u2019s lone US House representative for a decade before that, Carper began his run in statewide office, as treasurer, in 1977. After former Vice President Joe Biden, who endorsed him two weeks ago, Carper is probably Delaware\u2019s best-known political figure. A loss to Harris would have been the first of his long career. Carper\u2019s Senate seniority and decades of experience were as much a burden as a selling point in the race, which kicked off in earnest earlier this year when Harris, a 38-year-old Air Force veteran and community organizer, entered pitching new blood and a different kind of politics. By almost any metric, ousting Carper would have been the Democratic left\u2019s most astonishing victory of the season, which helped Harris\u2019 cash-strapped campaign attract a late outside boost from the progressive Working Families Party. Respectful, per Delaware\u2019s exacting demands for politeness in the political arena, but firm in her criticism, Harris, who is biracial and gay, had sought to cast Carper, 71, as an out-of-touch centrist who, for all his good intentions, is disconnected from \u201cthe urgency of now.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t wait a little bit longer for a pay raise,\u201d Harris said in an interview on a searing hot Labor Day in Wilmington. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait a little bit longer for health care that we can actually afford to use. We can\u2019t wait a little bit longer for our children to be properly educated or for our climate to be clean. These things are necessary and they have to happen now.\u201d Back in late June, Harris took a brief detour from her own efforts to stump alongside a little-known candidate in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Both were running on platforms headlined by \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d single payer health care, a $15 minimum wage, ending cash bail and a refusal to accept corporate political action committee donations. When Ocasio-Cortez won her primary, a handful of organizers from her team traveled south to join Harris\u2019 small, feisty operation. Last Friday, Ocasio-Cortez hosted a pair of town halls with Harris in Delaware. \u201cShe had my back and I\u2019m here to have hers,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in Newark, \u201cbecause that\u2019s how the progressive movement really works.\u201d But the similarities between their contests were checked by Carper\u2019s relentless political retail work. Unlike New York\u2019s Rep. Joe Crowley, whom Ocasio-Cortez defeated, the three-term incumbent has over the years gone to great lengths, literally, to sustain his relationship with voters back home. He commutes almost daily from Wilmington to Washington, DC, and frequently touts the 482,000 miles he\u2019s put on his Chrysler minivan \u201ctraveling up and down the state.\u201d Carper and his supporters had been quick to underline the differences between him and Crowley, a Queens Democrat with a home in Virginia who Ocasio-Cortez cuttingly alluded to in her viral campaign ad as someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t send his kids to our schools, doesn\u2019t drink our water or breathe our air.\u201d They had also gently, but consistently over the last couple of days, sought to portray the Harris campaign as a front for out-of-state progressives. \u201cMy gut tells me that they believe that Kerri is the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and they believe that I\u2019m somehow the next Joe Crowley,\u201d Carper said in an interview at a Labor Day picnic in Wilmington. \u201cThey think that Delaware is New York City. And I think they\u2019re mistaken on all three counts.\u201d Sweat seeping through a green Navy flight suit, worn to honor the late Sen. John McCain, Carper \u2013 now the Senate\u2019s only Vietnam veteran \u2013 argued that voters in Delaware wanted two things he was uniquely positioned to provide: someone with the clout to shape compromise on Capitol Hill while also leveraging that power to \u201cstop Trump from ruining this country.\u201d \u201cDelaware\u2019s almost schizophrenic, and I think the country is too. They want us to stop Trump from doing more stupid and, in some cases, cruel things, at the same time they want us to try to find common ground on a number of other issues,\u201d he said, ultimately landing on an optimistic note: \u201cAnd I think you can do both. I think you can do both.\u201d To say Harris offered a different view of the current landscape misunderstands, or at the least underestimates, the fundamental clash at the heart of this contest \u2013 and so many others in what has been a remarkable season of upheaval in Democratic politics. Harris was critical of Carper\u2019s record, including two votes in particular that favored the banking industry and pharmaceutical companies, but the roots of her challenge ran deeper. Their exchanges at a debate last week, the only one of the campaign, made clear the ideological and stylistic gulf. When Harris, in response to a question about college costs, said she would push for the elimination of all student debt, Carper dismissed the suggestion as plainly unrealistic. \u201cI don\u2019t have a magic wand that would enable us to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would cost a pretty penny.\u201d \u201cWhat bothered me,\u201d Harris said days later of his response, \u201cis that there\u2019s this idea that these are extreme ideas. But they only seem to be extreme for those who are multimillionaires living in Congress. They don\u2019t feel extreme to the people that you speak to in the streets. \u2026 We see that \u2018magic wands\u2019 are always available and present when corporations win.\u201d She also criticized Carper\u2019s vote in 2006 to elevate current Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Carper was the only Democrat still in the Senate to cross party lines. Asked during the debate why he had backed Kavanaugh then, Carper said his decision turned on the guidance of distinguished Delaware Judge Walter Stapleton, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, and other respected jurists from the state. \u201cI voted my hopes over my fears,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI will not do that again.\u201d At the debate, Harris returned to Carper\u2019s explanation when questioned about her inexperience in elected office, suggesting that his vote on Kavanaugh and, more recently, to back former drug company executive Alex Azar as the new secretary of health and human services underlined the need for a \u201cdiversity of experience.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s scary when you hear him say, \u2018I voted for Kavanaugh because all of his people (vouched for him),\u2019 \u201d she said on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s also the excuse for why he voted for Azar. He said he knew someone who went to Yale with him and said he was a good guy. If that\u2019s your reason for voting on things that can affect all of our lives, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d Carper said in a statement after the confirmation vote that he believed Azar was qualified for the job and shared his desire to transform the health care system \u201cto one that rewards health care providers based on the quality of care patients receive.\u201d Delaware is no stranger to unexpected primary challenges \u2013 or bewitching outcomes. The state has mostly elected some combination of the same handful of leading politicians, from both parties, over the past few decades. But as the Harris challenge gained steam, chatter increased about the fate of Republican Mike Castle, the former governor, lieutenant governor and congressman whose defeat in 2010 to a tea party outsider effectively squandered what had been viewed as a winnable Senate seat. Eight years on, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who defeated Republican nominee Christine O\u2019Donnell that November, warned that a win for Harris on Thursday could similarly imperil what\u2019s now considered a safe Democratic seat. \u201cI think it would be dramatically harder for (Harris) to win in November than Tom Carper,\u201d Coons said in a phone interview. \u201cI think there were a number of Delaware Republicans who voted for Christine O\u2019Donnell in 2010 to send a message to Mike Castle, that they wanted him to be a little sharper, little more conservative, little more ideologically pure. But they didn\u2019t imagine that they were handing the seat away.\u201d The Harris campaign rejected any claim that her nomination would open the door for the eventual Republican nominee, which CNN projects Thursday night will be Sussex County Councilman Rob Arlett, who was President Donald Trump\u2019s state chairman in 2016. Joe Dinkin, campaigns director for the Working Families Party, which through its independent expenditure committee backed Harris with $100,000 in field work, direct mail, texting and digital advertising in the home stretch of the campaign, dismissed Coons\u2019 warning as \u201cpreposterous\u201d and the campaign pointed to polling that suggested Harris would have started the general election campaign with a lead. Even with the late rush of support, Harris\u2019 campaign entered primary day having been outspent by something like 20-to-1, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Carper also boasted nearly every big ticket endorsement the state has to offer, from Biden to the Delaware AFL-CIO, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the state teachers union. The Working Families Party\u2019s outlay alone nearly matched Harris\u2019 total fundraising, which came in at around $120,000. \u201cWe\u2019re investing substantially in the race because Carper is operating a version of the Democratic Party that might\u2019ve passed muster in the 1990s,\u201d Dinkin said. \u201cBut it is not the direction progressives want to see right now.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Senators approved a massive $850 billion spending package Thursday and worked simultaneously to broker a deal to clear a large batch of presidential nominees, an effort to finish their work and salvage the last week of August for a truncated recess. While many senators are anxious to spend at least part of their August away from the Capitol, it was uncertain if leaders could clear several stubborn hurdles needed to finish their work and leave, or if they would need to return Monday and possibly work straight through Labor Day without a break. As they began late afternoon votes on the spending bill, aides and senators were pessimistic a deal on the nomination was near. \u201cSee you guys Monday,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called out to other senators after he voted on the spending bill, a clear sign a deal was unlikely before next week. In the Senate, the August recess will be missed Each side believes the other has an incentive to cut a deal and go. Democrats are convinced Republicans want to escape the endless questions from Capitol reporters about the swirling legal and political controversies involving President Donald Trump. Republicans, meanwhile, are sure vulnerable red-state Democrats up for re-election in November are desperate to get home to campaign. \u201cWe reconvened this month because too much of the American people\u2019s business remained outstanding,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said explaining why, under pressure from conservatives, he canceled the August recess, which typically lasts up to five weeks. But he said he would not release the Senate until the 17 nominations, which include 12 judges, were approved. \u201cThe Senate will continue to work right through August until every one of them is confirmed,\u201d McConnell warned. The list of nominees includes two senior government officials that some Democrats are reluctant to quickly clear. They are Richard Clarida, to be vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board, and Joseph Hunt, to lead the civil rights division at the Department of Justice. While McConnell has the power to keep the Senate in session, a negotiated solution would be cleaner and allow Republicans to claim victories for passing the spending bill and for forcing through the confirmations of so many of Trump\u2019s nominees. It would also allow senators to take what they see as a much-needed break before the fall sprint to the mid-terms, which includes a hotly contested confirmation process for Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh. On an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, the Senate voted 85 to 7 to pass a package of bills to fund the Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies. Bipartisan leaders this year made it a priority to pass government spending bills on time and avoid the constant and disruptive threats of government shutdowns that have marked recent spending debates. With that in mind, they decided to tie these two bills together in hopes that Republicans, who traditionally advocate for more defense spending, and Democrats, who typically press for more spending for domestic programs, would work together to keep co-called \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments and other controversial proposals off the bill. Mitch McConnell cancels August recess for Senate They went to great lengths to preserve their arrangement.  At one point Wednesday, 78-year-old Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy from Vermont, literally ran to the Senate floor from the Capitol basement when he heard Republican Sen. Rand Paul from Kentucky might be trying to strip Planned Parenthood funding from the bill, something opposed by many Democrats. In the end, Paul\u2019s effort didn\u2019t work, and he delivered a floor speech Thursday blaming GOP leaders \u2013 not Democrats or Leahy \u2013 for not working hard enough to pass his amendments. On the Democratic side, a move by Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy from Connecticut to prevent the Trump administration from using funds in the bill to arm school teachers, which many Republicans wouldn\u2019t support, was also kept at bay. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt from Missouri, a manager of the bill, called passage of the DOD and HHS bills a \u201cpretty significant accomplishment\u201d and said lawmakers would use the month of September to finish other spending bills and merge competing House and Senate funding bills and send them to the President before the new fiscal year begins October 1.",

            "article_content": "Paulette Jordan gently nudges her horse into the Idaho field, her yellow riding gloves loosely holding onto the reins as the sun begins to set on the nearly triple-digit temperature summer day. The Democratic candidate for governor pauses and pats the horse\u2019s neck. \u201cBeen too long,\u201d she says, and then moves the horse into a trot. Running for the highest office in a state that has never elected a female governor doesn\u2019t leave much time for riding. But it\u2019s on Idaho\u2019s most remote and independent lands where Jordan feels most connected, as both a person and a political candidate. Idaho has been a graveyard for Democrats seeking state or federal positions for decades. But Jordan\u2019s passion for her roots and battle cry that the state work for the people and not the other way round are winning attention and funding. She\u2019s being watched as a possible model for Democrats to win in rural areas. \u201cI was raised by the community of Idaho. I was raised by the land,\u201d says Jordan, her voice calm as it carries her central pledge to rural voters \u2013 to fight political cronyism and corporate corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn, my responsibility to take on this government that has sat idle and disserved the public. The citizens of Idaho deserve better. We\u2019re saying we\u2019re not here to be a part of the status quo or the establishment. That\u2019s how we in Idaho are as a people. We are fiercely independent. That needs to be driven back into our government. It needs to work for us, not against us.\u201d The Idaho gubernatorial ticket has never seen a politician like Jordan before. At 38, she is decades younger than the GOP candidate, 64-year-old Idaho Lt. Gov. Brad Little. Should she win, Jordan would make history on two fronts \u2013 the first Native American and the first woman to become Idaho\u2019s governor. Her chances of winning in this deeply conservative, overwhelmingly white state appear slim, if not impossible. Idaho\u2019s latest voter registration numbers show Republicans outpace Democrats by a margin of more than 4 to 1. The last time Idaho voted in a Democrat as governor was in 1990. Democratic candidates for governor since then have been cut from the same mold \u2013 politically moderate, white, older men. Their candidacies have been so abysmal that the Idaho Statesman referred to them with this blanket statement: \u201cthe sacrificial lamb in the governor\u2019s general election race.\u201d The most damning data for those looking for a Democrat surprise in November \u2013 Trump won Idaho by 32 points in 2016. But Jordan, an Idaho state legislator, has already bucked the trend, keeping her seat in a historically Republican rural district when a number of her fellow Democratic state legislators were defeated in the 2016 Trump wave. She was first elected in 2014, beating a Republican incumbent, drawing heavily on the Native American vote in her district. Jordan, a member of the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, grew up in Plummer, Idaho, a rural town of about 1,000 residents, about a third of whom live below the poverty line. She draws on that biography \u2013 the childhood lessons of her tribal elders and the struggles of her rural neighbors \u2013 to form a platform that is unabashedly progressive, but nuanced for rural Idaho. She touts independence from party politics, both from Boise\u2019s power structure and the ugliness in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re not speaking to political party issues,\u201d Jordan tells CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re speaking to the concerns of the people. The path to victory is talking to the people, people who are overlooked, disconnected to governance themselves.\u201d If that sounds Trumpian, the details are certainly different. Among the recognizably Democrat planks of her platform, Jordan calls for improving public schools \u2013 Education Weeks ranks Idaho 48th among the states and DC for educational performance and bottom for equitable distribution of funding. She also supports expanding Medicaid and has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood. Jordan proudly says she\u2019s not taking any money from the NRA but adds she\u2019s a certified and trained gun owner, who counts hunting as a hobby. She walks carefully around restricting assault rifles, preferring to talk about a gun owner\u2019s personal accountability. But the issue most central and personal to Jordan is not one on most Democrats\u2019 lists of talking points: keeping state public lands in the custody of the public. Her fear is that privatizing public lands means that areas would be auctioned off to wealthy people or corporations for private profit, encroaching on public hunting, fishing and recreation. She\u2019s pledged to support an agreement that allows the state of Idaho to co-manage public lands with the US Forest Service for continued access. That issue, Jordan believes, is a rural and urban Idaho value shared across party lines, but one that elites in both parties have forgotten about. \u201cWe are igniting a people who are often overlooked, ignored, and haven\u2019t been served for decades,\u201d says Jordan, who believes she can woo people who normally vote for GOP candidates. \u201cThese lands, they deserve representation. Republicans want what I want, they want independence. They want to be left alone. They want to live upon these lands with freedom. They don\u2019t want overregulation and the government controlling every aspect of their lives. They want the support they need.\u201d Democrats across the country like Joe Trippi are taking note of Jordan\u2019s rural-focused campaign. Trippi is a veteran of presidential races and was the chief media strategist on the Doug Jones campaign, which caused a massive upset in the Alabama Senate contest last December. Trump had won that state by 28 points but Jones beat out Republican Roy Moore, as the latter faced accusations by several women of pursuing relationships with them when they were teenagers, and in some cases, of molestation and sexual assault. Moore repeatedly denied all the allegations. Trump won Idaho by an even greater margin of 32 points and while no major scandal is hovering over the gubernatorial candidates as there was with the Senate race in Alabama, Trippi contends \u201cit is possible\u201d for Jordan to win by stitching together a coalition of voters, even in bright red Trump country. There are 100 days to the midterm election. Here's what to watch \u201cHer running the way she has, in defense of rural Idaho and defending it against the elites in Washington, has been a message that could prove very successful,\u201d says Trippi. \u201cDoes she win? Does she do significantly better than previous Democrats in Idaho? If so, that would be a wake-up call and we\u2019ll all be thinking differently about how best to reach out to voters we haven\u2019t been able to carry before. There were a whole lot of people who thought we couldn\u2019t do it in Alabama. We did.\u201d Jordan\u2019s progressive positions have grabbed the attention of Andrew Miller, a married father of two girls who lives in Boise. He voted for Trump in 2016, hoping he would shake up politics, and wants more change from another outsider. This is the kind of conservative or independent voter Jordan needs if she is to cause the upset her supporters want. Miller says he will vote for Jordan because he sees the GOP candidate, current Lt. Gov. Little, as too entrenched in the state\u2019s political structure. \u201cI just think she has a better pedigree and background to support and protect our public lands,\u201d says Miller. \u201cI think she\u2019ll support folks like us who want to keep public lands open and available and maybe not so much in the back pockets of other people who might want to influence her.\u201d Miller paused, then added admiringly, \u201cI think she has a pretty good shot with a rifle, too.\u201d But for every Andrew Miller, there\u2019s a Rick Zogg. A resident of Canyon County, a conservative stronghold, Zogg couldn\u2019t recall the name of the Democrat running for governor. He wasn\u2019t concerned about learning Jordan\u2019s name because he, like many he knows, always votes Republican. \u201cPolitically, I think it\u2019s very conservative here, with a big farming community,\u201d says Zogg, who moved to Idaho because he felt his native state of California was simply too liberal for him. \u201cEverybody that runs around here on (the) Democrat side seems to be just, very, very to the left.\u201d Women are the wave, but also the wall, for Democrats in 2018 The Rick Zoggs of Idaho are why Jonathan Parker, chairman of the Idaho Republican Party, says, \u201cI think we\u2019re in a good position,\u201d though he adds they are not being complacent. Parker notes Jordan has energized the Democratic base, drawing so many supporters in Idaho\u2019s primary that some precincts ran out of ballots. \u201cWe\u2019re paying very close attention to Paulette. We\u2019re not taking her lightly. She\u2019s getting a lot of national attention, something that candidates in Idaho aren\u2019t used to getting,\u201d says Parker. Brad Little\u2019s campaign declined to speak to CNN for this story. Longtime Idaho political columnist Chuck Malloy describes the lieutenant governor as someone who \u201cdoesn\u2019t inspire people with a stump speech. But I don\u2019t think that Idahoans want flashy.\u201d Malloy calls Jordan bright, young and inspirational, but likely unable to pull together enough voters to win in this deeply Republican state, even with a rural message. \u201cI don\u2019t see that kind of sea change. Where is she going to get her votes?\u201d says Malloy. \u201cUntil proven otherwise, Idaho is a Republican state.\u201d Jordan bucks the naysayers and believes in this political time, when Democratic voters are hungry for change and Republicans are tired of the fighting in Washington, she will win. \u201cThe people have been fooled for far too long. Now they\u2019re waking up. It\u2019s our responsibility to get to them.\u201d",

            "article_content": "While the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and Russia\u2019s meddling in US elections has topped the headlines, Democratic midterm candidates across the country have found it difficult to engage swing voters on those topics. But the contenders challenging Dana Rohrabacher in California\u2019s 48th District believe they\u2019ve got a special case in the quirky Republican congressman, who has persistently advocated for closer US relations with Russia and claims to have once arm-wrestled Russian President Vladimir Putin. With less than two weeks before California\u2019s June 5 primary, Democratic candidate Harley Rouda, who likes to refer to Rohrabacher as \u201cPutin\u2019s favorite congressman,\u201d is taking a wry look at some of Rohrabacher\u2019s odder statements \u2013 highlighting the Orange County congressman\u2019s unusual Russia connections with a light touch in a new digital ad featuring former \u2018Seinfeld\u2019 star Jason Alexander. Rouda enlisted Alexander, who played the infamous George Costanza on \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d to serve as his moderator in a mock debate with Rohrabacher, who appears in television clips from an iPad-style screen mounted on the podium opposite Rouda in the mock debate. Alexander introduces Rohrabacher as appearing \u201cfrom a secure server in Moscow,\u201d as the screen shows a past clip of Rohrabacher abruptly cutting off a television interview by waving and repeatedly saying \u201cgood bye.\u201d The digital ad then features clips of Rohrabacher refuting the notion of climate change, calling it a \u201ctotal fraud\u201d and suggesting that past climate change cycles were caused by \u201cdinosaur flatulence,\u201d and also taking on Planned Parenthood. Rohrabacher on Hill testimony: 'I'm an open book' on Russia While the Russia probe has dominated the headlines for the past year, interviews with voters in CA-48 by CNN have underscored that it is not a top-of-mind issue. Several of the Democratic contenders, including Rouda, have argued however that Russia relations have distracted Rohrabacher from more pressing issues facing the district. On Election Day, Rouda believes that Rohrabacher\u2019s ties to Russia will be an important issue that galvanizes voters on the left. And in a race with margins this tight, the level of Democratic turnout is likely to be the most pivotal factor in determining which two candidates advance to November. \u201cI think it does cut across the political spectrum. When you start with the Democrats on the left, this is a really important hard topic \u2013 in that he\u2019s unfit for office,\u201d Rouda said in an interview with CNN after a debate with other Democratic contenders earlier this year. For other voters, Rouda said that when he reframes the question to ask how \u201cRohrabacher\u2019s efforts to build a better relationship with the Russians \u2013 how is that impacting jobs in the 48th district? How is that helping families in the 48th District? It doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then they start waking up and saying, \u2018Yeah that\u2019s not creating jobs here, why is he spending so much time on that instead of focusing on the real issues that we have here in the 48th District?\u201d Rohrabacher\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. US Congressman talks Russian money laundering with alleged ex-spy in Berlin At the moment, Rouda is battling contenders on two fronts because of the complications of California\u2019s jungle primary. The presumption here is that Rohrabacher will easily glide through the primary, where the top-two vote getters advance to November. (Rohrabacher won his 15th term with 59% of the vote; but Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the district by less than 2%). The real fight this primary season has been for the number two slot. On the Democratic side, Rouda has been locked in a fierce battle with Hans Keirstead. Both men have been up on television with ads, but Rouda has the advantage of being part of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s \u201cRed to Blue\u201d program. Just this week, Rouda\u2019s campaign and the DCCC put about $400,000 behind a joint ad touting Rouda\u2019s advocacy for Obamacare, climate change, women\u2019s equality and \u201cfighting the NRA.\u201d To prevent a scenario where Democrats get boxed out of both slots in the top-two primary, the DCCC\u2019s independent group has also been hammering Republican Scott Baugh with negative ads. As of Tuesday, the DCCC\u2019s outside arm had run more than $1 million in negative ads against Baugh on Rouda\u2019s behalf. CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Cecile Richards is president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. One year ago, I took a flight from Miami to Washington, hoping to arrive in time for the Women\u2019s March the next morning. Our flight attendant leaned over to me and asked, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s going to make any difference, this march?\u201d She wore a pin commemorating her 20 years of airline service, and I could hear the skepticism in her voice. I understood her uncertainty \u2013 was the anger and passion shared by so many women across America in the wake of the 2016 presidential election enough to inspire real change? The truth was, I had no idea. As we found out, no one could have predicted the magnitude of the next day. Marches erupted across the country and on every continent. Several reports said it was likely the largest demonstration on record in the United States, dwarfing the inaugural crowd the day before. By some estimates as many as 4 million people just felt they had to march. So they picked up their signs, left home and spoke with their feet. So many people remember where they were that day. In Washington, marchers packed the National Mall for as far as the eye could see. And it wasn\u2019t just women, either. Folks from every walk of life came out to say, \u201cThis is my issue, too.\u201d A young man carried one of my favorite posters: \u201cI\u2019m proud to be marching with the future president of the US \u2013 I don\u2019t know who she is, but I know she is here!\u201d Beyond Washington, thousands of people held up signs in Salt Lake City, record-breaking crowds gathered in Texas, and Alaskans of all ages weathered subzero temperatures in Fairbanks to show their support. The best part is that these marches were just the beginning. In the 12 months since January 21, 2017, women have been organizing and agitating like never before. The \u201cpussy hat\u201d has become an international symbol of the resistance. Homegrown women\u2019s groups are popping up everywhere, from Phoenix to Kenosha, Wisconsin. Tried and true political organizations such as Emily\u2019s List have seen record numbers of women expressing interest in running for office \u2013 more than 26,000 since the 2016 election, according to Emily\u2019s List President Stephanie Schriock.  And women have been a driving force behind scrappy startups such as Swing Left and Run for Something, which are changing the electoral landscape by bringing in new candidates with fresh perspectives. Fueled by the energy of that day \u2013 and this administration\u2019s unrelenting assault on the rights of just about anyone not deemed white or male or straight enough \u2013 women are feeling their power in ways unimaginable the day before the marches. The first test came when President Donald Trump and Congress pledged to repeal Obamacare and \u201cdefund\u201d Planned Parenthood. House Speaker Paul Ryan promised it would happen by early February, just days after Trump would take office. Any other year, with Republicans controlling both chambers and the executive branch, that might have happened. But women and young people led the revolt, knowing that Trumpcare would take aim at maternity benefits, family planning and affordable health care. Women in pink hats and T-shirts flooded town hall meetings, demanding answers. Members of Congress couldn\u2019t handle the heat and started avoiding their own constituents. An avalanche of angry callers bore down on the congressional switchboard. An analysis by Democratic pollsters Lake Research Partners examined the usage of the popular app Daily Action, which directly connects people to their representatives, and showed that 86% of calls made to lawmakers in the months immediately after the march were coming from \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 women. The idea of \u201cdefunding\u201d Planned Parenthood and repealing Obamacare was so unpopular that, just before the legislation came to a vote, a USA Today/Suffolk University poll found that only 12% of Americans supported Trumpcare. Women on what feminism is ... and isn't Twelve months after this fight began, not only are Planned Parenthood\u2019s doors still open across the country, but millions in America have kept their coverage. It\u2019s no coincidence that two Republican women, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, held strong with the entire Democratic Senate caucus (and were then joined by Sen. John McCain) to stop the legislation that would have ended affordable health care for so many. Women aren\u2019t only affecting policy; they are determining election outcomes. In the two most closely watched races since the 2016 election, women of color turned out and made history. The Democratic sweep in Virginia and the election of Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama \u2013 after a race in which his opponent was accused of sexually abusing young women (allegations he denied) \u2013 defied what many believed was possible a year ago. Democrats flipped 15 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. Eleven of those races were won by women, including the first openly transgender state legislator, the first Vietnamese-American legislator, and the first two Latinas to serve in the House of Delegates. More broadly, women are shaking the foundations of our culture. Since day one of this administration, women have been persisting, reclaiming our time and saying once and for all that #TimesUp. The radical power of the #MeToo movement has demonstrated that we are done accepting the status quo. It\u2019s time. An America where everyone has an equal shot at success means our country is more likely to live up to its promise. 2018 will be the year of women A year after the Women\u2019s March, I wish I could find my flight attendant friend and ask her what she thinks. I hope she\u2019s seen for herself the power of women standing up and taking charge. I hope she exercises her own power to vote. And I hope she knows that when she does, she won\u2019t be alone. Today, women are the most potent political force in this country. The Women\u2019s March sparked a movement, and an unstoppable one at that. We\u2019re changing everything: our policies, our culture and our media \u2013 and come November, we\u2019re going to change our representatives in office.",

            "article_content": "For many, the fight against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was about more than a seat on the Supreme Court. It was a test of how far the conversation about sexual violence has come in the year since survivors began raising their voices. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations. But supporters of #MeToo say the Senate\u2019s vote to confirm Kavanaugh showed just how little the institutions of the American government have been touched by the cultural shift taking place in other realms of society. Now, activists and survivors say they intend to channel their anger over his confirmation into political and legislative action for the midterms and beyond. \u201cThere are things that have become evident in the course of this process, including that senators have completely abandoned their responsibility to the people, to hear the voices of their constituents,\u201d said Women\u2019s March Chief Operating Officer Rachel Carmona. There is still a huge divide on gender roles in the US \u201cAs a result, we will be taking our power to the polls in November and voting them right out.\u201d The first target of their political activism is the midterms, followed by the 2019 Women\u2019s March. Then, all eyes will be on the 2020 general election. Activists and civil rights groups say they will continue working to strengthen laws and policies related to workplace harassment and prosecution of sex crimes, two key issues to arise from misconduct allegations against high profile figures in the past year. Groups focused on sexual violence prevention say they plan to continue advocating for more treatment resources and education. Activists say the fight includes identifying candidates that support those aims. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of one of the most vibrant reckonings around sexual harassment and violence in more than a generation, and institutions have been struggling to catch up,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cWe now understand that survivors can come forward, we\u2019ve created spaces for that to happen, and now the job of institutions is to make sure they\u2019re not covering for abuse.\u201d Terri Poore, policy director for the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, says her organization and its affiliates have seen demand for their services \u2013 and donations \u2013 increase since #MeToo began. Crisis hotlines also saw an uptick during the Kavanaugh hearings. Given the hard line some companies have taken in response to allegations of sexual violence against high-profile men in their ranks, Poore was hopeful that those in the top levels of government would send a similarly strong message. Why people hesitate to report sexual misconduct After initially calling Christine Blasey Ford a \u201cgood witness,\u201d President Trump \u201copenly mocked a survivor\u201d and cast suspicion on her account, Poore said. Later, during an event marking Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, the President apologized to Kavanaugh for \u201cthe terrible pain and suffering\u201d he and his family went through in the hearings. But the President was far from the only person to question Ford\u2019s credibility due to gaps in her memory and her delay in reporting. Assumptions about what survivors should remember or how they should behave contribute to fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of sex crimes and their impact on survivors, Poore said. How myths about sexual harassment keep us in the dark Research shows that memory gaps are common in traumatic events and that there are numerous well-founded reasons why people don\u2019t report. The recognition of the impact of trauma on memory has led law enforcement agencies to revise techniques for interviewing sexual assault survivors. Poore said that advocacy groups such as hers will continue working to educate the public on so-called \u201crape myths,\u201d consent, and how to be active bystanders. The fight includes legislative advocacy to increase more funding through the re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act, she said. Only these 8 states require sex education classes to mention consent Support groups will keep pushing the message that they believe survivors, and that counseling and support groups are available for them. Ideally, she said, such conversations would start in schools or come through in views expressed by the country\u2019s leaders. \u201cWe want leaders at the top levels of power to be sending the kinds of messages about ending sexual violence that we know inspire change, and that\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation gives the court a conservative majority that is likely to shape case law for the next generation. Progressive activists are worried about the implications for health care, reproductive rights, criminal justice policies and voting access, among other issues. \u201cWhat we stand to lose at this point is the rolling back of much of the progress that people have died and struggled to achieve,\u201d said Tamika Mallory, national co-chair for the Women\u2019s March. Where Brett Kavanaugh stands on key issues While protesters were gathering in Washington to protest Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, organizers from numerous groups were training volunteers and activists for future actions, Mallory said. They were registering voters and canvassing for black gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia, she said \u2013 and they will continue to do so up until the midterms. Mallory said another focus is raising awareness around ballot initiatives, such as one in Florida to restore voting rights to felons who meet certain criteria. Such efforts are part of larger initiatives by numerous racial justice groups to increase voter participation among people of color, she said. \u201cPeople should be as frustrated and as angry as they want to be,\u201d Mallory said. \u201cThey should be visibly in the streets, but that they must take that anger and frustration to the polls, and they cannot go to the polls alone. They must make sure they take their families and communities with them.\u201d After the midterms, Mallory said that training and preparations will continue for actions in states across the country, including the third annual Women\u2019s March. Then, the focus will shift to engaging more women and people of color in the 2020 elections, she said, as voters and candidates. She The People is a group that focuses on engaging women of color as candidates and members of an overlooked voting bloc. \u201cThe country will not be saved by white women, it will be a multiracial force that will be led by women of color,\u201d said Aimee Allison, Democracy in Color President and She the People Founder. A historic year for minority women in politics \u201cOur message is, we have to double down on our vision of expanding democracy. If we continue to exercise our rights as members of society, the arc of justice will bend our way.\u201d Feminist writer and activist Soraya Chemaly focuses on the role of gender in politics and pop culture. Her latest book, \u201cRage Becomes Her: The Power of Women\u2019s Anger,\u201d focuses on how women can use changing narratives around female anger to their benefit. She said she has noticed more white women getting involved in issues that women of color have been focusing on for years \u2013 including #MeToo, which activist Tarana Burke started more than a decade ago. And these white women are angry, she said, which can be a useful tool for social justice. Not the \u201cblind rage\u201d that provokes violent acts or the denigration of other people, she said, but the kind that moves people to take up a cause they believe in. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last two years is a gradual awakening,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even close to the arc.\u201d Graves said the National Women\u2019s Law Center will continue to fight in court for those who experience harassment and assault in the workplace and schools. And they will support efforts to fight statutes of limitations in rape cases, she said. \u201cWhere the courts fail us, we will be seeking to put new laws and policies on books at the state and federal level, and we will be doing it with an extremely energized base behind us,\u201d Graves said. Already in the past year, according to a new NWLC report, eleven states and two localities have passed laws to strengthen protections against workplace harassment. Four jurisdictions expanded those protections to include independent contractors, interns or graduate students. What it takes to prosecute a sex crime Five states enacted legislation that prohibits employers from requiring employees to sign nondisclosure agreements as a condition of employment, the report said, a mechanism perceived to silence victims and enable employers to hide harassment. Poore said her group will continue advocating for laws that encourage survivors to report \u2013 including the Congressional Accountability Act, which would overhaul how complaints are handled on Capitol Hill. More work needs to be done to strengthen protections for people in blue collar jobs, Jess Morales Rocketto of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. Her organization represents domestic workers, most of whom are women of color who are vulnerable to workplace sexual harassment and violence. Rocketto said that, despite the threat to their cause that the Kavanaugh confirmation presents, she sees hope in the past year\u2019s progress. As #MeToo gained momentum and continued through the nomination process, survivors found their voices by sharing their stories, she said. And they\u2019re getting in lawmakers\u2019 faces, she said, pointing to the case of two women who confronted Republican Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator and her own experience sharing her story with Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. On my way out of the Senate today I ran into @TedCruz. He looked at me in silence for 15 seconds after I told him my story of assault. He told me \"substance matters.\" I told him the substance of my argument was #BelieveSurvivors and to #BeAHero and vote no on Kavanaugh. pic.twitter.com/FCVpqzGaXA \u201cIt\u2019s not just about a Supreme Court nomination, it\u2019s about women coming out and realizing their power and using their anger as a political force.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ellie Kaufman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In an unexpected turn that rankled the party\u2019s left flank, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez on Thursday endorsed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s re-election bid. His announcement, at the party\u2019s state convention on Long Island, comes in the midst of a feisty primary campaign between Cuomo and actress Cynthia Nixon. \u201cYou\u2019ve been delivering results that have made people\u2019s lives better,\u201d Perez said in his speech. \u201cThat\u2019s why Andrew Cuomo and (New York Lt. Gov.) Kathy Hochul are charter members of the accomplishments wing of the Democratic Party, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to endorse them.\u201d Perez\u2019s nod came alongside endorsements for Cuomo from 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Joe Biden. The one-two-three punch of prominent establishment leaders arriving at the convention to publicly back Cuomo angered Nixon supporters and dredged up grievances tied to the 2016 presidential primary, when the DNC\u2019s national apparatus favored, though never openly endorsed, Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cPerez coming in at this time only further drives a wedge in the Democratic Party,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, the executive director of New York Communities for Change, a progressive activist group supporting Nixon. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing play out, in a microcosm here in New York, is that the party elites are out of touch with where the base of the party is at.\u201d First elected in 2010, Cuomo is facing a challenge from Nixon, who has attacked the governor for not pursuing a more aggressively liberal agenda. She trails Cuomo, who was backed by 95% of state party delegates on Wednesday, in the most recent polls by more than 20 points despite gaining ground since entering the contest a little more than two months ago. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful for Chairman Perez\u2019s support and look forward to working with him to elect more Democrats at every level in November,\u201d Cuomo spokeswoman Lis Smith said on Thursday afternoon. Perez was voted DNC chair in February 2017 over, among others, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, who ran with the support of the Sanders coalition and has been vocal in advising the party to steer clear of the primary process. A DNC official cast Perez\u2019s decision to intervene here as more of a personal one, noting that the Buffalo-native and Cuomo have a personal relationship going back decades. Ellison said in a statement Thursday, \u201cThe Democratic Party should not intervene in the primary process. It is our role to be fair to all contestants and let the voters decide.\u201d The DNC has worked to mend post-2016 fences by using a \u201cUnity Reform Commission\u201d to tackle a suite of contentious intra-party disputes. Perez and Sanders also took part in a \u201cunity tour\u201d last spring in an effort to help soothe relations. But New York City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who is running to unseat Hochul in the September primary, argued that the timing of the endorsement undermined that message. \u201cIt seems like each time the DNC gets involved in a primary they support the establishment Democrats instead of the party\u2019s left leaning progressives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be nice if, at some point, calls for unity also mean supporting the left wing of the party.\u201d Nixon\u2019s campaign wouldn\u2019t directly address Perez\u2019s decision. In a statement, Nixon spokeswoman Lauren Hitt dismissed the endorsements as an afterthought. \u201cCuomo can cloak himself in all the endorsements he wants, but it won\u2019t hide the fact that he\u2019s effectively governed as a Republican for eight years,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause he helped the Republicans maintain control of the Senate, we lost the chance to pass the DREAM Act and to protect women\u2019s reproductive rights, among other progressive policies.\u201d",

Jeanne Shaheen on Tuesday became the latest member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to oppose CIA Director Mike Pompeo\u2019s nomination for secretary of state. \u201cThe Secretary of State is a policy-making position and I continue to have deep concerns regarding Mr. Pompeo\u2019s past statements and policy views, particularly in regards to the LGBTQ community, American Muslims and women\u2019s reproductive rights,\u201d Shaheen said in a statement. \u201cFor these reasons, I have concluded that I cannot support Director Pompeo to lead the State Department at this critical time.\u201d Shaheen\u2019s statement underscores the difficult situation Pompeo faces after President Donald Trump tapped him to replace ex-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Pompeo appeared before the committee last week for his confirmation hearing and faced sharp questions over foreign policy and the ongoing special counsel investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.

            "article_content": "It's been nearly a year since President Donald Trump took office It was a year of change for his family It\u2019s been a jam-packed year of news since President Donald Trump moved into the White House, but it\u2019s also been a transformative \u2013 if tumultuous \u2013 year for each member of the first family. Trump and his extended nuclear family\u2019s first year in Washington saw new homes in cities, new roles, new books and even a new baby. And each member\u2019s unique use of social media provided a window of insight into their new lives. Here\u2019s what the President\u2019s brood has been up to since Inauguration Day: First lady Melania Trump Melania Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House got off to an unusual start as she opted to stay in New York through the conclusion of the school year with the first couple\u2019s 11-year-old son, Barron. It marked just the first departure from tradition for a first lady who has exhibited an independent streak and an air of mystery in her first year. Trump hired a small staff for her East Wing throughout the spring, beginning to define a platform over the summer that centers around helping children, including a focus on combating childhood bullying and America\u2019s opioid epidemic. Trump has played the role of hostess at the White House at events, such as the Easter Egg Roll and Halloween, as well as when world leaders and their spouses have visited the White House. She also occupied the role of a gracious guest, accompanying the President on trips abroad to Asia, the Middle East and Europe. A post shared by First Lady M. Trump Archived (@flotus45) She\u2019s embraced events with children, which she has made a hallmark of her time as first lady, including multiple visits to Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington and hospitals abroad. The extremely private Trump has largely refrained from participating in media appearances, speaking publicly only on rare occasions. However, she has used fashion as a key messaging tool. Trump turned heads in a baby blue Jackie Kennedy-inspired outfit at the inauguration. In addition to taking over the reins at the Trump Organization from his father, Donald Trump Jr. was a presence on the political circuit in 2017. He traveled to Montana to stump for US House of Representatives candidate Greg Gianforte, spoke at Republican party fundraisers in Indiana and Texas and went pheasant hunting alongside Rep. Steve King in Northwest Iowa. But bombshell revelations that Trump Jr. arranged with publicist Rob Goldstone to meet with Natalia Veselnitskaya, a woman described as a \u201cRussian government attorney,\u201d overshadowed Trump\u2019s year, plunging him into the center of investigations into the Trump campaign\u2019s role in Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The hard-charging, no-apologies first son of Donald and Ivana Trump pushed back just as hard against the scrutiny, continuing his bombastic social media habits through the year as the story developed. First daughter Ivanka Trump moved to Washington just before the inauguration with husband Jared Kushner and their three small children \u2013 now 1, 4, and 6 \u2013 taking a formal leave of absence from the Trump Organization and her eponymous apparel and accessories brand. She moved into a West Wing office in March, beginning a formal role in her father\u2019s administration that\u2019s been heavily scrutinized. Ivanka Trump and Kushner were at the center of the infighting and chaos in the Trump White House\u2019s first months, leading a global-minded faction at odds with a nationalist faction led by Steve Bannon. Many thought she would serve as a moderating influence on her father\u2019s positions on everything from climate change to LGBTQ issues to women\u2019s reproductive rights \u2013 but so far, that\u2019s failed to materialize. Her portfolio, which once seemed to include dabbling in nearly every issue that crossed her father\u2019s desk, is now more neatly tailored to women\u2019s economic empowerment, workforce development, STEM education and combating human trafficking, with infrastructure in store for 2018. The education of Ivanka Trump She\u2019s spent the last year building relationships within the administration, as well as with Congress and officials abroad, traveling to Germany, where she spearheaded the rollout of WeFi, a World Bank facility aimed at empowering women in developing countries, speaking about women\u2019s participation in the economy in Tokyo at the invitation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and discussing human trafficking alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May at the United Nations. Trump also emerged as a key player in tax reform, pushing for the expansion of the child tax credit. A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) Her role is still not without a heightened layer of scrutiny \u2013 Trump was roundly criticized last week for tweeting support for Oprah Winfrey\u2019s speech on the #MeToo movement, calling on men and women to come together \u201c& say #TIMESUP!\u201d Trump has styled herself as an advocate for women in the workplace with her West Wing portfolio and her book, \u201cWomen Who Work,\u201d but, beyond her tweet and comments to The Associated Press on then-candidate Roy Moore, she has yet to substantively weigh in on the #MeToo movement. The West Wing portfolio of the President\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was so broad in the early months of the Trump administration that it was hard to track his growing list of responsibilities. But much like Trump Jr., he has also been in the crosshairs of investigators looking into the Trump campaign role in Russia\u2019s election meddling. But Kushner has spent his year advising the President on a multitude of issues, embarking on the ambitious goal of negotiating an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. He has made multiple unannounced visits to the region, developing relationships and vying for influence with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as the President made the controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which has thrown peace discussions in flux. Trump\u2019s son-in-law also leads the White House\u2019s Office of American Innovation, which aims to make government more efficient and eliminate bureaucracy, though has remained amorphous and ill-defined. The soft-spoken Kushner testified before congressional investigators over the summer. Eric Trump assumed the reins of the Trump Organization alongside his brother in 2017, traveling to Trump properties across the world. But it was also a big year at home \u2013 Eric and his wife, Lara, welcomed baby boy Luke in September, adding a ninth grandchild to the President\u2019s brood. A post shared by Eric Trump (@erictrump) Along with his wife and older brother, Eric Trump has been involved with his father\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign, holding meetings this year at the Republican National Committee to talk strategy. While ethics rules prevent the Trump children from discussing the family real estate business with their father, they have played a role in laying the groundwork for the reelection campaign. Lara Trump has taken on an even bigger role in the reelection campaign, serving as a campaign senior adviser and becoming a key spokeswoman for 2020 efforts. A post shared by Lara Trump (@laraleatrump) She\u2019s made frequent appearances on Fox News and anchors a series of YouTube videos on the reelection website called \u201creal news updates.\u201d Trump worked for Inside Edition before her father-in-law became President, and her television background suggests more air time as Trump\u2019s reelection efforts accelerate in the coming year. The year 2017 held its own transitions for the President\u2019s youngest daughter, Tiffany Trump. Trump, who grew up in California with her mother, Marla Maples, followed her father from New York to Washington, where she is a first-year law student at Georgetown University. A post shared by Tiffany Ariana Trump (@tiffanytrump) The University of Pennsylvania graduate, now 24, has been on hand at the White House for family events, including the Easter Egg Roll and a private dinner celebrating her father\u2019s birthday in June. She spent the week after Christmas at Mar-a-Lago, posing for a selfie video with sister Ivanka. She also traveled to Europe over the summer, visiting Budapest and Berlin with then-boyfriend Ross Mechanic, and Italy by yacht with her mother. A post shared by Tiffany Ariana Trump (@tiffanytrump) Trump has otherwise evaded public appearances, save for an early January run-in with TMZ in Los Angeles following the publication of \u201cFire and Fury.\u201d Asked if her dad eats McDonald\u2019s in bed every night, Trump laughed, climbing into an SUV. \u201cHe wishes,\u201d she said. The youngest of the President\u2019s five children, Barron Trump, now 11, lives with his parents at the White House. Following his move to Washington in June, Trump has settled into St. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland, where he is in sixth grade. The first lady has made an effort to give her son as much of a normal life as possible, and Barron Trump has made rare public appearances this year, joining his parents at the Easter Egg Roll, donning his eclipse glasses in August on the Truman balcony, and flying on Marine One and Air Force One on weekend trips to Bedminster and Mar-a-Lago. But it\u2019s clear that Barron, an avid soccer player, has taken advantage of the White House grounds \u2013 a goal post is set up in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden alongside the East Colonnade. The President\u2019s first wife, Ivana Trump, had her time in the spotlight in 2017 with the publication of her book, \u201cRaising Trump.\u201d The week the book came out, she sparked a public feud with Melania Trump, calling herself \u201cfirst lady\u201d in an interview with ABC News and saying she doesn\u2019t call the White House often \u2013 despite having a direct line \u2013 so as to not make Melania Trump jealous. Her 293-page memoir touched on her childhood in communist Czechoslovakia, romance with Donald Trump and subsequent boyfriends and husbands, the tumultuous divorce, and bringing up her three children, telling embarrassing and endearing anecdotes about Ivanka, Donald Jr., and Eric, sharing advice about divorce, and that time she tried to order wine at a Taco Bell. She told CBS News she turned down an opportunity to be ambassador to her native Czech Republic because \u201cI have a perfect life,\u201d a jet-setting schedule she\u2019s likely to maintain in 2018. Marla Maples, the President\u2019s second wife, kept a relatively low profile in 2017, focusing on her family and friendships. \u201cShe has embraced the importance of these relationships and put them first during this year of great change,\u201d her spokeswoman told CNN via email, writing, \u201cIt is also so very important in her daily life to help share and create unity wherever she witnesses fear, anger, or separation.\u201d Maples attended the inauguration and came to Washington to help daughter Tiffany move into law school in the fall. The soft-spoken, spiritual Maples eschewed formal media interviews, with the exception of an October People Magazine feature on her eating habits (a clean-eating vegan who occasionally eats steak). Maples is an advisory board member of AWARENYC, a New York nonprofit women\u2019s organization, traveled to Italy to perform in Ballando Con Le Steele \u2013 the Italian Dancing with the Stars \u2013 in the spring. She also spent time skiing in Wyoming and spent seven days in silence at a retreat in North Carolina.",

He was a consultant to Priorities USA Action, which was a pro-Obama super PAC before it was a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. Once in a while, a politician becomes so powerful and yet so destructive that he or she does real damage to the branch of government in which she or he serves. Obviously, Richard Nixon damaged the presidency, Newt Gingrich turned the House of Representatives into a mixed martial arts arena, and Roger Taney forever stained the Supreme Court with the Dred Scott decision. But it takes someone special, someone rare, someone spectacularly Machiavellian and malevolent, to screw up all three branches of government. Ladies and gentlemen: Mitch McConnell. The soft-spoken Kentuckian has, in just a few short years, done lasting damage to the presidency, the Senate and the Supreme Court:  the hat trick of democracy destruction. To wit: McConnell flips, changes his rule on Supreme Court confirmations The presidency. American intelligence knew Vladimir Putin\u2019s henchmen were attacking America, using cyberwarfare tactics to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Yet when the nonpartisan leaders of our intelligence community briefed McConnell, his reply \u2013 according to a new book by Washington Post reporter Greg Miller \u2013 was purely partisan: \u201cYou\u2019re trying to screw the Republican nominee.\u201d McConnell not only refused to condemn the Russians, Miller writes, he threatened to attack the US intelligence community, labeling its call to defend America an act of partisan politics. By helping hobble our defense against the dark arts of Putin, McConnell has tainted Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. The noted media scholar Kathleen Hall Jamieson has carefully examined the Russian effort, and has concluded that without Russia\u2019s help, Trump would not be President. Gergen: McConnell cares about getting it done Trump\u2019s legitimacy is questionable \u2013 in part because McConnell refused to defend our presidential electoral system when it came under foreign attack. The Senate. McConnell has broken the Senate. By refusing even to meet with President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, and by blocking hearings on his nomination, McConnell deeply harmed the comity on which the Senate is supposed to run. I am amused by the notion that, somehow, former Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid is the one who broke the Senate when he eliminated the filibuster for lower court judgeships. Right. If only Reid had been nicer to sweet ol\u2019 Mitch, then he wouldn\u2019t have been so doggone mean when he got power. In truth, Reid had no choice but to limit the filibuster on lower court nominations, given McConnell\u2019s abuse of it. McConnell invoked the 60-vote rule to block Obama\u2019s nominees nearly as often as it had been used in all previous US history. Under all the presidents before Obama, 86 nominations had been blocked by filibuster. In just the Obama presidency alone, McConnell used the filibuster to block 82. McConnell\u2019s naked partisanship has crippled the Senate. One wonders how it will ever recover. The Supreme Court. Which brings us to the high court. Not content with simply stealing Garland\u2019s seat for Trump, McConnell rammed through the nomination of the profoundly unpopular Brett Kavanaugh. The court now has four justices appointed by Presidents who originally came into office after losing the popular vote.  (To be fair, George W. Bush nominated Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito in his second term after winning the 2004 election fair and square. But does anyone think he would have had a second term if the court had not installed him despite the will of the voters in 2000?) The McConnell court is now every bit as partisan as one of the panels on my old show, \u201cCrossfire.\u201d Except on \u201cCrossfire,\u201d we didn\u2019t wear robes and pretend we were somehow above the fray. For decades to come, American citizens upset about any erosion of their constitutional rights \u2013 civil rights, LGBTQ rights, voting rights, women\u2019s rights, reproductive rights, consumer rights, environmental protections \u2013 can thank McConnell. Legacies are often hard to predict when a politician is still in office. Not this time. When you see bitter, hateful, vengeful hyperpartisanship infecting our national life \u2013 from the White House to the Senate to the marble palace of the Supreme Court \u2013 you can thank the \u201cGentleman from Kentucky.\u201d",
